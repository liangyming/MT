This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.
The pyramid of ocean life ...
Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.
Well, some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around, and instead of accumulating, they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they're absorbed by us.
Here's a diagram of the PCB load of dolphins in Sarasota Bay.
That top predator, of course, is us.
And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs, dioxins and heavy metals.
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan, and I'm really proud to say that at this point, it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan that's labeled incorrectly, even though they're still selling whale meat, which I believe they shouldn't.
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying, "Closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can't use it"?
That means that the beach might have great waves, but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them, even after a great day of surfing, this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.
So what do you do?
In 2009, the picture is dramatically different.
Other people, like David Packard and Julie Packard, who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium to lock into people's notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be.
Hahahaha.
BJ: From an actor.
AK: It has ears that move passively when the head goes.
BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said, "Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre?"
So we made a model.
BJ: So we got a camera, and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances.
And Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre, saw that particular moment, he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself.
So here are some half-finished horses ready to be worked in London.
Come here. Stand here where people can see you.
Horses' hearing is very important.
AK: You want to say something about the breathing?
It's three heads making one character.
Thank you. Thank you.
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground, for a couple of months.
In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on; you enjoy your family life inside.
So, cut to the modern day.
When they passed Go, they collected twice the salary, and they got to roll both dice instead of one, so they got to move around the board a lot more.
Paul Piff: Okay, so it was quickly apparent to players that something was up.
PP: Okay, so no surprises, people are onto us.
And what my colleagues and I for the last seven years have been doing is studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies.
Individuals who made 25,000 sometimes under 15,000 dollars a year, gave 44 percent more of their money to the stranger than did individuals making 150,000 or 200,000 dollars a year.
We've even studied cars, not just any cars, but whether drivers of different kinds of cars are more or less inclined to break the law.
None of the cars, none of the cars in our least expensive car category broke the law.
But over the last 20 years, that significant difference has become a grand canyon of sorts between those at the top and everyone else.
Again, these are outcomes not just experienced by a few, but that resound across all strata of society.
And there's the Giving Pledge, in which more than 100 of our nation's wealthiest individuals are pledging half of their fortunes to charity.
But by the end of the 20th century, a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way.
The book is called "Blessed Unrest."
Take a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose.
One of the best known is Acumen Fund, led by Jacqueline Novogratz, a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED.
This tackles yet another assumption, that the giver and the organization is at the center, as opposed to putting the problem at the center.
We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things.
Many of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer Vernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity, where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create, really, a shockingly new reality.
We are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible.
Whatever that means to you.
My own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people. 80 percent.
He just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day.
But Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist who is working on Filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the Philippines, was telling me about how much parenting is going on through Skype, and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype.
So, think of the three settings I've talked to you about: factory, migration, office.
The phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand, fully to the people around you.
And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach, where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere.
And they are doing it massively.
Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York, if seen with a mobile phone in a hand.
There's another reason as well.
It can get sideways like a rally car driver, always able to take the tightest curve, even on slippery, changing surfaces, never spinning out.
Not only that, they're able to do it lap after lap after lap.
She's putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in John's brain as he races around the track.
Now, the Corkscrew is a chicane, followed by a quick right-handed turn as the road drops three stories.
But what's really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental workload doesn't increase.
They are things that they have simply learned to do.
Do we want our car to perhaps be a partner, a coach, someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential?
Talk about a sweet beginning.
So a few years ago, L.A. County decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools.
It can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months.
The water is turned into goo.
And it has since moved to her bones and her brain.
Now they're all very practical visionaries.
Even when we think or talk about recycling, lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates -- they leave much to be recycled.
Mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land, and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity.
And I call it "hometown security."
The challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more.
So you need to help him out.
And over the past 20 years, we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems, yet educational outcomes, malnutrition, incarceration, obesity, diabetes, income disparity, they've all gone up with some exceptions -- in particular, infant mortality among people in poverty -- but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.
Over here.
It's time to stop building the shopping malls, the prisons, the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures.
And I thought that was the best deal in town, so I accepted it immediately.
And after doing this for a long time, and the Media Lab passing the baton on, I thought, "Well, maybe it's time for me to do a project.
And when people tell me, "Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids?"
The point being, this is going to be very, very intensive on the programming side.
Whether we sell, it doesn't make any difference whatsoever.
It was getting its power in a different way. It's kind of childlike.
We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.
And I can race through these and save a lot of time because Yves and I obviously didn't compare notes.
They're not going to be near another laptop, so you have to nail these onto a tree, and sort of, get it.
Again, when you're a nonprofit, you look at children as a mission, not as a market.
When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay, the first 100,000, boom, went to OLPC.
And the "Give One, Get One" program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested.
I won't dwell on the pricing at all.
But a million a month in laptop-land is a big number.
Now at the time that I was reading this, it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment.
Back at the time, a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing.
And we have window farms all over the world.
And we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers.
Yeah, I think that's pretty likely -- there's going to be lots of robots everywhere.
And on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics, where you put a PC on, and you program this thing with a GUI to wander around your house and do various stuff.
We're going to give this away I think, Chris said, after the talk.
I don't know if you see -- so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there, I put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up.
Okay, so it's doing local navigation there.
Nick Robertson has that story.
There's a sea change happening in how -- where technology's going.
I'm going to show this robot a task. It's a very complex task.
Because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing and interacting with, and what you're understanding what it's doing.
RB: Yeah, it was really bad, but -- remember, especially when Haley Joel Osment, the little robot, looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it?
Can you hear that now, out there?
RB: It smiles. She imitates the smile. This happens a lot.
We put that together. Then we put in turn taking.
And he brings the watch center, into the robot's field of vision, points to it, gives it a motion cue, and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully.
They first make eye contact, and then, when Christie looks over at this toy, the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she's looking at.
And it's moving forward, you know, propelled by various charges, and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect.
Before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot, and before that a not so bad robot.
This economy won't work," and Thomas Jefferson saying, "The people won't trust that.
And at that moment our economy collapses.
The Democrats, they say, well, this isn't a big deal.
It's good to let markets move resources to their more productive use.
And I know that's hard to believe, that the American people are moderate, pragmatic centrists.
Americans are about 50/50, whether they're Democrats or Republicans.
The vast majority want to protect military defense spending.
You were in what they called the saltwater camp, meaning Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, or you were in the freshwater camp, University of Chicago, University of Rochester.
And this nonpartisanship is something that exists, that has existed in secret in America for years and years and years.
Then you can see radical partisan change.
In 1913, we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve, when it was created, with vicious, angry arguments over how it would be constituted, and a general agreement that the way it was constituted was the worst possible compromise, a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing, this dollar, but then everyone agreeing, okay, so long as we're on the gold standard, it should be okay.
And so just the act of compromise itself, and sustained, real compromise, would give us even more time, would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain and reach even more compromise down the road.
And the watchmaker turned around and said, "God can see it."
One of the most early work was done in automotive design -- some very exciting work was done there.
So I started to ask myself questions about it.
But it might be.
And how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know, or what we're going to learn, about something?
I'm watching your faces very carefully.
Where are you feeling this?
And by the way, there's no pleasure in that face.
And this is the dilemma, this is the paradox, of beauty.
So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic.
But they're both different.
This bit, the big secret of automotive design -- reflection management.
So it disappears.
But unfortunately, the likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty.
Beautiful? Maybe lesser.
This is a beautiful water bottle -- some of you know of it -- done by Ross Lovegrove, the designer.
You all, I guess, like me, enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance.
Are you ready? Okay.
But you're a slave of that first flash.
It informs, it tells us, it supplies us answers before we've even thought about it.
There have been some very vocal atheists who've pointed out, not just that religion is wrong, but that it's ridiculous.
I'm interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines: that thinks, "I can't believe in any of this stuff.
So that's a sort of tough choice.
I'd like to kick off by looking at education.
And influential voices came up with one answer.
This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of.
Perhaps this is just me, maybe you.
That's what all religions tell us: "Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day."
Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset.
Nonsense, says the religious world view.
And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart.
And you would go, "Amen, amen, amen."
They tell us to have a bath.
You've heard that saying.
They have no trouble telling us what art is about.
Let's think of something else.
And that has all sorts of advantages.
So religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind.
If you're involved in anything that's communal, that involves lots of people getting together, there are things for you in religion.
You can get shot by both sides.
The universe is large and we are tiny, without the need for further religious superstructure.
There's so much we can absorb.
Because you've agreed on 90 percent of things, because you have a shared view on so many things, and you politely differ.
And that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts, to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes, detectors, instruments that people are building, or have built, in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail.
And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors.
If dark matter exists in our universe, in our galaxy, then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about -- one of them being neutrinos.
And what the Russians are doing is they're building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light.
And you have to imagine, there's an entire sea-like lake underneath, moving.
The Very Large Telescope is one of these things that astronomers do -- they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively.
An extraordinary set of telescopes.
So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.
And the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly.
Here's the balloon being filled up with helium, and you can see it's a gorgeous sight.
And on the far left there is a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery.
If we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve.
It's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians, they were able to build the Library of Alexandria -- the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world.
So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we?
Then the question is, what do you get?
It's starting to be a little bit more specified.
And being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopian sort of world, we thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda, we might have something.
We have one of these things now. It's completely cool.
You actually can go and read scanned books quite easily.
If they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them, because you could just buy another one, that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning.
If we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages.
And especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about, in languages that you can read.
If we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows.
So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale.
And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers.
But anyway, it's doable, but we've only found about a thousand of these things that -- to be out of copyright.
It's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television -- Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC -- 24 hours a day.
So books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it.
So anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from.
Is all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private?
Imagine, if you will -- a gift.
You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body.
And this, and then this.
I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms -- otherwise known as "Uh-Oh" -- -- and every organism had a right to vote, would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet?
Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms.
We share in common the same pathogens.
This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey.
And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion, but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms.
I believe matter begets life; life becomes single cells; single cells become strings; strings become chains; chains network.
This was first discovered in 1859.
How is it that this organism can be so large, and yet be one cell wall thick, whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?
We came back to our pile, it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms, and the color changed to a light form.
The entire pile was a green berm of life.
So, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time.
I've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program.
And so, for the first time, I am showing this.
I did something that nobody else had done.
Now after sporulation, the spores repel.
Then you harvest the seeds -- and thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this -- and then you're harvesting the seed garden.
But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent, and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels.
And hopefully from that I get to learn something.
We had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything.
And over the ensuing few years, there were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2.
Will it work? Or will something happen that we can't understand and we can't fix, thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres?
At that moment I became part of that biosphere.
And so we were working to sequester carbon.
And the doctor was, in fact, checking us to make sure we were, in fact, fine.
And we found it in the concrete.
We were -- yeah I don't know that we were fixable.
Not only that, but I lost touch of where my food came from.
And one of the things we did was try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres, and what can you do with them?
But this is also what I saw.
So they're all shitting each other's ponds, quite literally.
And understand its interactions with the entire Earth.
And I threw away my rake.
The Industrial Revolution -- and Prometheus -- has given us this, the ability to light up the world.
Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here.
And then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good.
It was a time when medicine was cheap and very ineffective.
This was when the core structure of medicine was created -- what it meant to be good at what we did and how we wanted to build medicine to be.
We can't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life.
That is to say, it took basically the nursing time and then just a little bit of time for a doctor who more or less checked in on you once a day.
And what that means is there's hope.
And you put it all together and what do you get?
He didn't see it in his own patients.
I got interested in this when the World Health Organization came to my team asking if we could help with a project to reduce deaths in surgery.
Could we design a checklist for surgery?
We had the pause points immediately before anesthesia is given, immediately before the knife hits the skin, immediately before the patient leaves the room.
And it's been slow to spread.
Even the cowboys are pit crews now.
And this flu has wiped through the population of bees.
And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss.
Now, those losses are tragic on many fronts, and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper.
But you meet this beekeeper, and I met this beekeeper here, and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met.
But if you're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies, you can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried about losing this segment of our industry.
And they're not people who like to ask for help, although they are the most helpful people ever.
And that's a really great expression, because really, bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are, you know -- they get paid for their services.
And there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined.
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate.
I've had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.
But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here, because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational.
And everyone should open a beehive, because it is the most amazing, incredible thing.
I'm trying to do this in English.
And when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better.
So I immediately called her up, of course.
And I also entered the world championship, and I won there in 2004.
So I whistle the tone.
I'm so used to that.
And the artist that drew this observation test did some errors, had some mistakes -- there are more or less 12 mistakes.
Plants are not living creatures -- this is the point.
You know very well about professors.
When he speaks about animals, [he] tends to remove the fact that plants exist.
This is a Dionaea, a Venus fly trap hunting snails -- sorry for the snail.
These are young sunflowers, and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing.
Now, there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen.
Now, this is a root apex growing against a slope.
Now let's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others.
And another possibility is a technological possibility.
Hybrid means it's something that's half living and half machine.
So the first project we're going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride.
I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf.
And we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made, forgetting our pants on this cold January day.
And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride.
So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this.
And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance.
A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006 and said, "You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around."
And I told people, "Don't work. Don't actually do work.
They're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt.
But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop.
People are coming in from Queens, transferring from the E train to the 6 train.
We don't need a reason.
And it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile, people still need to drink water.
That means there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place, no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information.
Thank you.
And I was thinking, how do I introduce this?
Now why am I talking about cows?
Now that very idea, I think, strikes terror in many people, or anger, or anxiety of one sort or another.
And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today.
You have a responsibility to the world, to the state, to them, to take care of them right.
Well, I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious.
They depend on us for their survival.
Except, of course, it wasn't the sheep's cleverness.
Evolution is cleverer than you are.
Lancet flukes aren't smart.
Here's what he said.
There was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good I'm going to read it to you.
There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species.
I'm talking also about Christianity.
Those are from "The Purpose Driven Life."
He's absolutely right.
It's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes -- updating them, quietly dropping obsolete features, putting new interpretations on other features.
That's really important.
I wish he could do this with a revision, a Mark 2 version of his book.
By the way, I find Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim.
Here's one: "God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique.
And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral, if you want to have meaning in your life, you have to be an Intelligent Designer -- you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection.
Now Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move.
And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.
A very clever little meme.
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.
Listening is an active skill, whereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at -- it's a relationship with sound.
Expansive listening, on the other hand, is listening "with," not listening "for."
Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music.
We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people.
Seek those sounds out; they're good for you and so it this.
Lithotripsy -- saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound.
I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that.
And let's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that I played you early on.
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history.
They're not brought to us with light, at least not directly.
And even light could not escape this current.
It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.
So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.
And if you can see -- it's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves.
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving.
But they're not frozen; they're actually merging.
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
It's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...
If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
Thank you. Thank you.
You might have a guess.
I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons, and I think the answer is yes.
They've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners.
We're being critical of the West, the perception of the West about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us, about our women, about our politics, about our religion.
Art is our weapon.
It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
I was an outsider who had come back to Iran to find my place, but I was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.
"Women Without Men" returns to history, but another part of our Iranian history.
And most of all, in the way that we fought for democracy.
Now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009, as my film is released -- the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran.
They have confronted the authority.
One cannot contribute unless one feels secure, one feels big, one feels: I have enough.
When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.
It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win.
It transcends nation, the gender, the age.
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole, which is within our experience, everybody's experience.
It has got to be you.
Compassion is going to be limited.
You express yourself because you have compassion.
You act compassionately as though you have compassion: grind your teeth, take all the support system.
We can integrate over the surface, and the notation usually is a capital sigma.
But what we're going to talk about in this is how we're going to the next level.
You have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin, without feeling like they're wasting my time.
And let's pause here.
We have tried everything, viewed everything, bought everything.
If Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus, I wouldn't have to.
One, when those teachers are doing that, there's the obvious benefit -- the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did.
And then you go build on that in the next concept.
Do it as long as necessary until you have mastery.
But the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map.
It'll change what happens at the dinner table.
Every column is one of those concepts.
The outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on.
So when you talk about self-paced learning, it makes sense for everyone -- in education-speak, differentiated learning -- but it's kind of crazy when you see it in a classroom.
And actually, that kind of brings an interesting point.
And I have to make it clear, it's not just me anymore.
And they said, "Oh, this is kind of radical. We have to think about it."
So they can actually track them as they go through the entire district.
Is this ready for prime time?
But yeah, it's all there.
They seem to come from the outside, and to mimic perception.
And she said, "People in Eastern dress, in drapes, walking up and down stairs.
I see a lot of children. They are walking up and down stairs.
She wasn't on any medications which could produce hallucinations.
She said, "Did he have them himself?"
Now with the original description in the 18th century, Charles Bonnet did not have them.
And then he saw a big wheel in midair.
That was the only figure he recognized.
And then the six figures came together again, like a concertina.
These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field, like a screen.
As a physician, I have to try and define what's going on, and to reassure people, especially to reassure them that they're not going insane.
Faces, and sometimes deformed faces, are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations.
And it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus, they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces.
So you may not only have "car" cells, you may have "Aston Martin" cells.
And instead of getting normal perception, you're getting an anarchic, convulsive stimulation, or release, of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex.
Think of the number of blind people.
Oliver Sacks: I was afraid you'd ask that.
I've gone and had an fMRI myself, to see how my visual cortex is taking over.
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution.
So why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light?
It's unbelievable.
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this.
This is a golden coral, a bush.
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy.
Here's another one. This is also a sea pen.
We call it the electronic jellyfish.
There's something small there that responds.
And this is a burglar alarm.
But he's persistent.
But if you do take the plunge, please remember to turn out the lights.
And this idea is actually nothing new.
Even as a scientist, I used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible, with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work, until I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell, who is a molecular biologist at the Scripps Institute.
I was very much inspired by this image many years ago, and I wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world.
But they physically run in opposite directions, which creates a number of complications for your living cells, as you're about to see, most particularly when DNA is being copied.
This was work from a number of years ago.
They go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots.
So this is a single chromosome.
It is made up of about 200 different types of proteins, thousands of proteins in total.
That is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal.
Exploring at the frontier of science, at the frontier of human understanding, is mind-blowing.
There is going to be no turning back.
In time, all of science will come to be a continuum of description, an explanation of networks, of principles and laws.
I'll now proceed quickly, and before else, to a subject that is both a vital asset and a potential barrier to a scientific career.
Ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied for its own sake.
This is not to de-emphasize the essential requirement of broad training, or the value of apprenticing yourself in ongoing research to programs of high quality.
Once you have settled on a specialty, and the profession you can love, and you've secured opportunity, your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it enough to become an expert.
Scientists, pure mathematicians among them, follow one or the other of two pathways: First through early discoveries, a problem is identified and a solution is sought.
You'll find your own way to discover, to learn, to teach.
But I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge.
More protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted.
And from literate populations, new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge, religion and politics.
He started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered, much to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won -- it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won, it won the second tournament -- that's known as tit for tat.
Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s.
I'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines. In biology, the notions of symbiosis, group selection, evolutionary psychology are contested, to be sure.
Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source, pointing to a new form of production: peer-to-peer production.
eBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game.
In El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy.
I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen; it's going to require effort.
Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them.
Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting.
So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab.
What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry.
That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market.
I want to talk a little bit today about labor and work.
I'll never do it again."
And he told me the following story: He said that for more than two weeks, he was working on a PowerPoint presentation.
So I started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor.
So in the second condition of this experiment, that's exactly what we did.
And by the way, we should point out that this was not a big meaning.
People who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more Bionicle.
There was no relationship between the love of Lego and how much people built, which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people's eyes, we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity.
And everybody raised their hand.
But the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation.
And we had three conditions.
In the acknowledged condition, people worked all the way down to 15 cents.
So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA.
People did not want them.
They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder.
You worked for us, but I'll tell you what, we'll sell it to you.
They thought everybody else would love it more as well.
When you looked at the hard instructions, the effect was larger.
But imagine this was slightly different.
Which comes to tell you one more thing, which is, much like our builders, when they look at the creature of their creation, we don't see that other people don't see things our way.
This is a picture of my family, my four siblings -- my mom and I -- taken in 1977.
In a country of only seven million people, one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders, their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields.
But not just that, they actually banned money.
And she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors, that she would take the chance and claim to be Vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive, because at this point they're forcing everybody to work.
And it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady who told her this, and then tutored her for two days intensively, that she was able to go into her exam and -- you know, this was a moment of truth.
And I got word last month that the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, and 70 percent of the people are illiterate.
So, doctors prescribe medication.
But let me repeat the words of the woman.
And I started thinking about a counseling program.
This was a very exciting time, developing this with my wonderful Afghan team.
And here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression, moderate and severe.
One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor, "If we were to have met some years ago, then we would have killed each other.
In due course, Britain started using oil and gas from the North Sea, and in the year 2000, oil and gas production from the North Sea also peaked, and they're now on the decline.
So here's a question: Imagine if we said, "Oh yes, we can get off fossil fuels.
That's true of European biofuels.
Next, let's add Asia in red, the Middle East and North Africa in green, sub-Saharan Africa in blue, black is South America, purple is Central America, and then in pukey-yellow, we have North America, Australia and New Zealand.
That's 15 years of progress.
Well, we can measure renewables in the same units and other forms of power production in the same units, and renewables is one of the leading ideas for how we could get off our 90 percent fossil fuel habit.
If you really want to get a lot from solar panels, you need to adopt the traditional Bavarian farming method where you leap off the roof and coat the countryside with solar panels too.
Being generous to concentrating solar power, I think it's perfect credible it could deliver 20 watts per square meter. So that's nice.
So by this particular metric, nuclear power isn't as intrusive as renewables.
And a third option is nuclear power.
Yes. Here it is. It's the bicycle. It's 80 times better in energy consumption, and it's powered by biofuel, by Weetabix.
Use your own eyes and be smart, read your meter, and if you're anything like me, it'll change your life.
Nuclear power, to get 16 light bulbs per person, you'd need two gigawatts at each of the purple dots on the map.
From my teachers, my family and my community, I had all the necessary support to become a musician.
Today we can say that art in Latin America is no longer a monopoly of elites and that it has become a social right, a right for all the people.
Nothing else.
He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic, and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras.
That's why the child's development in the orchestra and the choir provides him with a noble identity and makes him a role model for his family and community.
The spontaneity music has excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society.
And these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of, if you will, the intelligence of interaction.
So you get a 13-inch, 19-inch, whatever, TV, and then you should multiply that by eight and that's the distance you should sit away from the TV set.
And so when you see on the market these systems that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution, it's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing.
And we have never known how to do this technically, so this slide is a fake slide.
Now, imagine a screen, which is not only touch-sensitive now, it's pressure-sensitive.
Now, imagine a program where some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light: one is an anvil on a fuzzy rug and the other one is a ping-pong ball on a sheet of glass.
We are so used to doing monologues.
And here -- again, my favorite example -- is the cookbook, the "Larousse Gastronomique."
I can get back to the illustration, but in this case it's not a single frame, but it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair that's described in the text.
And of course, good education has got to be good entertainment, so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment that we've been doing -- in this case, in Senegal -- where we have tried to use personal computers as a pedagogical medium. But not as teaching machines at all; the whole notion is to use this as an instrument where there is a complete reversal of roles -- the child is, if you will, the teacher and the machine is the student -- and the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of approximates thinking about thinking.
And you obviously have been hoodwinked or you've talked about somebody else."
And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar, but wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there, and it is: when does it mean something to a child?
On the other hand, you give a kid -- a three-year-old kid -- a computer and they type a little command and -- Poof! -- something happens.
Yes, it is. It's our work -- that was a while ago, and it still is my favorite project -- of teleconferencing.
And the plastic heads, sometimes you want to project them.
And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone, and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take, and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend.
When you pick up the phone, how much tremor are you having, and what is that like, and what is that trend like over a period of time?
Behavioral markers matter.
So, we study the holistic health experience of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years in 20 different countries.
Well folks, it's like we know these demographics here.
The first boomer actually, we didn't even wait till 2011, next year.
This mentality of traveling to and timesharing large, expensive healthcare systems actually began in 1787.
We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare.
We're doing 15-minute exams with patients.
Boomers will press the button. Trust me.
How do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls from ever occurring in the first place?
I'm a qualitative researcher, but when I look at these data streams coming in from these homes, I can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else knew that they were on, because we see the changes in their patterns in the household. Right?
This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility.
These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies.
How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal of dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming?
Some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like, and I thought I'd give you a quick insight into my career so far.
Right? Well, actually, statistically speaking, if you only visit porn sites, you're safer.
But it goes further.
Maybe some of you have received an email that says something like, "Hi, I'm a Nigerian banker, and I'd like to give you 53 billion dollars because I like your face."
which I've covered in coffee, and I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key and print me a new one.
That can be very embarrassing.
This is a script.
Now I liked it better when viruses were free.
Now that's obviously interesting, because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals.
We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool.
Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys.
TEDAttendees, HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying?
Things get more interesting.
Would someone be able to abuse it?"
You're going to read about malware doing incredible and terrifying, scary things.
I wanted to be a paleontologist, a dinosaur paleontologist, and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.
And I wander about the hills, and I have found a few things.
In social groups of animals, the juveniles always look different than the adults.
So I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it, and you drilled into it, and you got something out of that insect, and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again, you'd have a room full of mosquitos.
So she sampled some material out of it.
And we did find a lot of stuff.
But Mary went further.
But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.
We're just not going to be able to do what they did in "Jurassic Park."
The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No."
So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken.
And atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.
We can make a chicken with teeth.
If you look at dinosaur hands, a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.
And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail.
What good is it?"
I went to the local baker and took their stale bread.
We're talking about good, fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale.
So a country like America has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the American people.
The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock, the maize, the wheat and the soya.
But this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in Britain, in Europe, in North America.
We contribute to that squeeze by depositing food in bins here in Britain and elsewhere in the world. We take food off the market shelves that hungry people depend on.
It's called sheep's organs.
Fish, 40 to 60 percent of European fish are discarded at sea, they don't even get landed.
In fact, humans answered that question 6,000 years ago: We domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food.
A silver lining: It has kicked off globally, the quest to tackle food waste.
Secrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year just because, you know, I'm into the TED thing.
There we see Mars, again with various names.
Djabran Fluctus.
"No, no, really, I'm so busy with the stars.
Niliacus Lacus, try to get the practice, slick-a-tick-a-bacus.
The first consideration, make it clear, simple and unambiguous.
So, I look to you, fellow member of the Earth community.
Is that Mars Ya Marov?
We have names for places where people don't exist.
There is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night.
What a coincidence!
Better really hurry up.
Not a good picture. Now, my friends in the island of Nevis are a little better. Look at that! That's Isaac Newton.
They got little babies in there, floating in there.
René Descartes, of course. Once again these Grenada people, this is like way too sick for anybody's imagination.
Here is a map. All they have is a casino on it.
And the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work.
I can just divide numbers, that's like atom smashing.
There is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now, because you would say, "Hey, go back to the Fluctus part."
And they recapitulate that shape, even though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of 36. It's nuts.
Which works mathematically, but it just doesn't seem God-like to me.
Not stamps, but one day.
Eighteen and 19, the middle of the Moleeds, 0.618 is the golden section.
And, in fact, everybody's listed twice, because it's sorted once by name and once by email address.
And then I thought, "Nah, that wouldn't be very nice."
Now, there was an interesting thing that happened last April.
It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet.
Everything started breaking.
And so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses Internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other.
And the problem with it is, I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system, where we take a system that's basically built on trust, was basically built for a smaller-scale system, and we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate.
So there's been plenty of people, plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years, but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B when plan A seems to be working so well.
Many things have been said about this.
And with these keys, they may have been able to get inside CENTCOM's systems, to see and hear everything, and maybe even infect some of them.
This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker, because the defender doesn't know who to fight back against.
In this context, when you don't know if the potential enemy is preparing for defense or attack, and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking, then this environment is most likely to spark a conflict.
In May 2009, General Kevin Chilton, commander of the U.S. nuclear forces, stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the U.S., all options would be on the table.
So you have to make a living cartooning.
There's been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean, mostly negative.
And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it, and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born.
So if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like, that's what a dinosaur looks like.
I love to draw the deep sea fish, because they are so ugly, but beautiful in their own way.
Let's see.
He's a great white shark.
And then I'll introduce you to one more character, this guy, Ernest, who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body.
But it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters.
He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride, which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well.
The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult.
Ostensibly, he's dead now.
Meanwhile, Ernest finds his fins on the internet.
So you get this sense of urgency, like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible.
Thanks for listening.
He came back to California and named his dog after that river of enchantment.
It was a tool carved from caribou bone by his grandfather in 1910, and it turned out to be a specialized implement used by a trapper to skin out the eyelids of wolves.
It's a sanctuary. It's a burial ground of their ancestors.
My name is Art Benjamin, and I am a "mathemagician."
And let's give these volunteers a nice round of applause.
Would you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case?
1369. 1369.
Anyone I point to, call out a three-digit number.
205,849?
Yes? Oh, one more, one more three-digit number please.
Nine.
So, since we've reached the limits of our calculators -- what's that? Does yours go -- I don't know.
How many digits do you have, six or seven?
One, OK, 197042.
What year?
Audience: Fifth.
Audience: 1947. 1947, and the month?
I didn't mean to look at you, sir -- you were just sitting there.
What year, Chris, would you like?
Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy?
Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number that I will try to square. Go ahead.
Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer.
Next, I do 57 squared, which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion. Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK, finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489.
So I'm not going to talk about that.
So, I'm not going to talk about that.
I'm supposed to talk about the future, yes?
But to me, things aren't the future.
This is a Klein bottle.
And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions, it can hold fluids.
Way back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah!
Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about -- is that okay?
Put your money where you mouth is."
No calculus, I'll cut out that.
I'd love to measure the speed of light here.
Right? This is simple physics.
So anytime I talk, you'd see it on the screen.
And we'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz, or 1760.
I'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus.
There's a clock, clock, clock, clock.
So, I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells, and I look at it.
Three times.
So I'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint.
And because it's really designed around an edited set of possessions -- my favorite stuff -- and really designed for me, I'm really excited to be there.
By all means, we should buy and own some great stuff.
Look at the coffee table -- it grows in height and width to seat 10.
Would that give me a little more freedom?
I think we may have lost something in our culture.
And this polar bear stands over the husky, no claws extended, no fangs taking a look.
John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers, and I have.
When that mother and infant lock eyes, and the infant's old enough to have a social smile, what happens -- spontaneously -- is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother.
If its purpose is more important than the act of doing it, it's probably not play.
They got together -- JPL hired them.
These lionesses, seen from a distance, looked like they were fighting.
And I love this one, because it's also what we're about.
In the animal world, if you take rats, who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play -- they squeak, they wrestle, they pin each other, that's part of their play.
This took a long time -- I had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECT and multiple EEGs, but as a couch potato, his brain has shrunk.
The basis of human trust is established through play signals.
And therefore, the most playful.
Now there's another play history that I think is a work in progress.
Most of us work with groups, and I put this up because the d.school, the design school at Stanford, thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment, has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called "From Play to Innovation."
Characterized by a feeling of energized focus, full involvement and success in the process of the activity.
Stuart Brown: So I would encourage you all to engage not in the work-play differential -- where you set aside time to play -- but where your life becomes infused minute by minute, hour by hour, with body, object, social, fantasy, transformational kinds of play.
And then you get an fMRI specialist, and you get Frank Wilson, and you get other kinds of hard scientists, including neuroendocrinologists.
So this dish in particular is basically champagne with seafood.
So this is a plate of nachos.
What I see is a cow about to eat something delicious. What is that cow eating?
BR: And it's definitely the world's first bleeding veggie burger, which is a cool side effect.
BR: And then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear, we really have something that looks, tastes and behaves like the real thing.
HC: So this is where we step into the future and we leapfrog ahead.
And here's how news shapes what Americans see.
Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on Google News' front page.
I'm an artist and an engineer, which is, increasingly, a more common kind of hybrid.
A lot of my work is about trying to get away from this.
By saying "Who is that person in the mirror? Oh it's actually me."
And one of them is called Taketa. Which is which?
And thus was born the project called Remark, which is a collaboration with Zachary Lieberman and the Ars Electronica Futurelab.
And it's almost impossible to perform.
I see subtitles all the time on television."
And no matter where I am, what's really going on here is that it's an eye-tracking system that tries to locate my eyes.
Alright. Let's leave that.
And at the same time, it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar psycho-social gaze behaviors.
It's always kind of doing a double take: "What?"
But also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it.
If this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point, why was it the case that it took us until 1984 to be able to discover this virus?
It's actually a fairly common picture.
We would actually enlist them -- which we've done now -- to collect specimens from animals.
Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least, at a minimum, been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities, which presumably, from our perspective, gives them the ability to decrease their own risk, and then obviously the risk to their families, the village, the country, and the world.
It's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves, which is, why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here.
So I said to myself, "OK, great -- we're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these different locations. It's going to be wonderful."
Paul worked for years on the Cameroonian national radio and television, and he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent.
Just a few quick before and after shots.
And what we've found is that if you look in the right place, you can actually monitor the flow of these viruses into human populations.
Needless to say, different populations from different parts of the world have different sorts of contact.
This is honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet.
What we didn't anticipate was the many, many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system.
In this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.
Probably the most important third-party development came from a little company in Virginia called Summize.
And this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends.
It's totally intimidating.
But, literally in the eight minutes he was talking, there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk.
So I was an early reader, and what I read were British and American children's books.
Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify.
Then one Saturday we went to his village to visit, and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made.
She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove.
So after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African, I began to understand my roommate's response to me.
Now, I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel, that it had failed in a number of places, but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity.
There were endless stories of Mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system, sneaking across the border, being arrested at the border, that sort of thing.
Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power.
I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.
All of these stories make me who I am.
I was not only charmed, I was very moved.
Every time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians: our failed infrastructure, our failed government, but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government, rather than because of it.
Thank you.
And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing, we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do.
It literally flat-lined.
But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps, that within these camps, a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition, that experts move with the prevailing winds, often hero-worshipping their own gurus.
I've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts.
What is the evidence upon which this is based?
By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company, Best Buy was able to discover, for example, that the store that it was going to open in China -- its big, grand store -- was not going to open on time.
He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago, and he was officially diagnosed in 2005.
I'm eating right, I'm exercising every day, I'm keeping my mind active, that's what the research says you should do.
Let's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself.
Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins?
A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms, as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance, you get muscle tremors, and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile.
When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world, his naked heart still shines.
It never left my brain.
On a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon, I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership.
The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension.
If you had charge spots everywhere, and you had battery swap stations everywhere, how often would you do it? And it ends up that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station.
Remember in your car you have a gas tank.
Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car.
But e-miles follow Moore's Law.
That's a new economic factor, which is fascinating to most people.
But one of them Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault and Nissan, when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating.
If you're thinking about it in terms of islands, we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find, and that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia.
It's called the other car.
Here is the problem: at 147 dollars a barrel, which we were in six months ago, the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil.
In other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak.
That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world.
We have all these regions.
Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves.
You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills.
Cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world's CO2 emissions.
came from a source of energy that was immoral: human slaves.
And we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years, but within this presidential term because if we don't, we will lose our economy, right after we'd lost our morality.
In professional circles everywhere, it's of course universally accepted.
They see us as rocking the boat, and you can understand why.
I think they're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion.
The standard creationist argument -- there is only one; they all reduce to this one -- takes off from a statistical improbability.
It turns out to be, in principle, incapable of doing the job required of it.
Perfectly ordinary scientific paper.
This is one nation under God."
As has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.
You can't help wondering why vote-seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of, for example, the Jewish lobby.
That is, the higher one's intelligence or educational level, the less one is likely to be religious."
A philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe, which is held by the vast majority of top American scientists and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally, is so abhorrent to the American electorate that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public.
On the contrary, they'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people that could serve as decent role models for your children, the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product, the kinds of people who are sitting in this room.
Aveling was a militant atheist who failed to persuade Darwin to accept the dedication of his book on atheism -- incidentally, giving rise to a fascinating myth that Karl Marx tried to dedicate "Das Kapital" to Darwin, which he didn't. It was actually Edward Aveling.
We, who are atheists, are also a-fairiests and a-teapotists.
It lacks the strong connotation that there's definitely no God, and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics.
As Carl Sagan, another recently dead hero, put it, "How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, 'This is better than we thought!
Well, here's how it changed me.
That's the critical change that is being inverted by the Net.
What this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized. Not that it's become less capital intensive -- that there's less money that's required -- but that the ownership of this capital, the way the capitalization happens, is radically distributed. Each of us, in these advanced economies, has one of these, or something rather like it -- a computer.
The other was Microsoft.
Another portion is not only how content is produced, but how relevance is produced.
But what we're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange.
It also requires certain new organizational approaches.
Peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry; free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft; Skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms; Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias.
That's what IBM does in software services, and they've done reasonably well.
And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.
And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa.
Does it mean the problem is over? The answer is no.
All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa.
We put together a program that would, one: get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.
The smartest one, first to come in, was the MTN company of South Africa.
And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.
And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.
We have opportunities in housing and real estate.
And I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries.
But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school, that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.
Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world, who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed, and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income.
He called these, "massively fatal discontinuities," meaning that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years.
Well, we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared, but this threat could reappear at any time.
Or polio? How many of you remember the iron lung?
They basically create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed.
These memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed.
In this rendering of the flu virus, these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you.
It was easily transmitted, but, luckily, was pretty mild.
We saw earlier that HIV is highly variable, that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus.
We know that they have to latch onto a specific part, so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part, present that through a vaccine, what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies.
We talked about before the H and N spikes on the surface of the flu virus.
So I want you to think back a few months ago.
Luckily for us, we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances.
So right now, the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains, and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu.
Now, as you know, bacteria reproduce quickly -- it's like making yogurt -- and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories, in a few weeks, with no eggs, for a fraction of the cost of current methods.
Luckily, this year's flu was relatively mild.
And that's the same with universal flu vaccine, the same kind of thing?
The world needs people like you. Thank you.
And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.
One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that.
You think the A.U. will put together a conference like this?
They are stuck in their intellectual patch.
They don't understand.
Look at Africa's begging-bowl.
That characterization, in my view, is even more charitable.
And if you look at them, the slate of the post-colonial leaders -- an assortment of military fufu heads, Swiss-bank socialists, crocodile liberators, vampire elites, quack revolutionaries.
Where do they get their money?
It's the seat of government.
As a matter of fact, we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors.
The other ethnic groups, which did have chiefs, made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power.
It's owned by extended families.
And when they produce their crops, they sell the surplus on marketplaces.
Yes, it's an enterprise.
80 percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine.
And the journalist was asking him, "Why is this so important?"
I'm progressive, politically -- big surprise -- but I've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives.
Think about it for a second: there is no standard Google anymore.
And this was the big story of the day at that time.
And I think, if you take all of these filters together, you take all these algorithms, you get what I call a filter bubble.
You know we all want to be someone who has watched "Rashomon," but right now we want to watch "Ace Ventura" for the fourth time.
And we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing.
Thank you so much, Chris. And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice. I'm extremely grateful.
There was no motorcade back there.
There's been kind of a series of epiphanies.
But what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech.
I add new images because I learn more about it every time I give it.
It's an easy, visible target of concern, and it should be, but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks.
Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important.
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it, en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge.
And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did.
We are one.
And the same thing with the atmosphere: If you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball, you would get that little sphere of gas on the right.
Coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem.
They can't go and work in the local hotel business because there isn't one in their community.
If you go to the places where it's just arriving, like the eastern part of the Gulf, in Alabama, there's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach.
You see people who are really shell-shocked.
Personally, I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body, because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene.
A writer named Ted Williams called me, and he was asking me a couple of questions about what I saw, because he's writing an article for Audubon magazine.
And he felt that -- he felt that it was coming to ask for help. Sorry.
When it comes time to spawn, they come inside, and these two tuna that were tagged, you can see them on the spawning grounds very much right in the area of the slick.
It's not like we're starting with something that's been okay.
The economic effects go at least nationally in many ways.
That one on the right is called Fishing Fool.
It's just ridiculous.
And you have to really wonder who are the laws made for, and who has gotten above the laws.
And even though the police can be a little annoying at times -- giving us tickets and stuff like that -- nobody says that we should just get rid of them.
Now there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place, but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed.
Ever since we lived in caves, every time we wanted any energy, we lit something on fire, and that is still what we're doing.
So my name is Taylor Wilson.
Now most of you are probably saying, well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion.
For hundreds of dollars, I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars.
So in about seven years of doing nuclear research, I started out with a dream to make a "star in a jar," a star in my garage, and I ended up meeting the president and developing things that I think can change the world, and I think other kids can too.
I am my connectome.
In this diagram, every node is a neuron, and every line is a connection.
And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis: I am my connectome.
In order to find connectomes, we have to see all the neurons at the same time.
And we can do that for another neuron in green.
We color every neuron in, in a different color, and then we look through all of the images, find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse.
Or maybe really, really fine capellini with branches.
So when show my friends this, sometimes they've told me, "You know, Sebastian, you should just give up.
Likewise, every connectome changes over time.
And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts, feelings and perceptions, our mental experiences.
Without it, the water would not know in which direction to flow.
So let's return from the heights of metaphor and return to science.
But it won't be easy, because they're not going to look like this.
I'll give you a hint. It's a big number.
One of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics.
On the other hand, if the connectome is still intact, we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily.
But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible, we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world.
He works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company, The Directors Bureau.
KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this, and they asked us, when's it coming out?
The force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force, would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market.
KS: Some of them automatically unroll like this one.
Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use.
KS: No, not yet.
And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water.
ZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist, but doesn't use a buckle.
In addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes.
KS: Now the way it works: there's a matrix of color dyes.
So, a patient can come in and actually blow into their device.
I mean, after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me.
I mean, it's crucified.
Suffice to say it's like -- it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming.
So several months ago, a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy, Eduardo Sousa.
They accused him of paying off the judges.
There's no force feeding.
Amazing.
So I hushed my voice.
I've never seen it. Have you?
They ate, and he showed me on a chart, how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers.
And they are allowed to take whatever they want.
That's how I've been trained.
So it's like, here I am, I'm on the fence about this guy, but increasingly, eating up his every word.
[Clapping] And the wild geese are calling down.
To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm?"
So how did it taste?
I'd had something that was called foie gras.
There's 100 percent star anise in there.
I turned to him at the end of the meal, and it's a question I asked several times, and he hadn't, kind of, answered me directly, but I said, "Now look, you're in Spain, some of the greatest chefs in the world are -- Ferran Adria, the preeminent chef of the world today, not that far from you.
Simple.
And they saw in the fall that there was this natural, beautiful, sweet, delicious fat from geese.
And they invented, what? Gavage.
It's an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology.
We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture.
And it's also almost always, and I haven't found an example otherwise, but almost always, the most delicious choice.
But now we need a new fire that makes us safe, secure, healthy and durable.
Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil -- although almost half is made from coal.
This could cost, by 2050, five trillion dollars less in net present value, that is expressed as a lump sum today, than business as usual -- assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero -- a conservatively low estimate.
So these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and seal-stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other -- namely ultralight materials, making them into structures and electric propulsion.
And they said, "We do not intend to be a typewriter maker."
And all those mega-barrels under Detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel.
We can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be, so they don't need to go somewhere else.
And the most biofuel we might need, just three million barrels a day, can be made two-thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate.
And they also converge the oil story with our second big story, saving electricity and then making it differently.
That is, it can give you expanding returns, not diminishing returns.
But first we ought to be capturing bigger, cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks.
In 2010, renewables other than big hydro, particularly wind and solar cells, got 151 billion dollars of private investment, and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding 60 billion watts in that one year.
That is exactly why we've designed the grid to back up failed plants with working plants.
For example, our over-centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy-shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack.
However, especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills, the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency, demand response, cogeneration, renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage.
Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions, both driven by modern efficiency, and you get the really big story: reinventing fire, where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050, saving 5 trillion dollars, growing the economy 2.6-fold, strengthening out national security, oh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal, reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent.
And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure, this new fire is flameless.
Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract.
But after we disbursed the loans, I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers, new health clinics without drugs, and the poor once again without any voice or recourse.
In this manner, the World Bank has now GeoMapped 30,000 project activities in 143 countries, and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects.
In this map from Moldova, the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes, and the red color shows the opposite.
These are the lonely warriors like my father and many, many others, and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds.
We need to accelerate these shifts.
And definitively, I don't know why I am here, but -- you know the nightmare you can have, like you are an impostor, you arrive at the opera, and they push you, "You must sing!"
It means the design must be just the weapon for marketing, for producer to make product more sexy, like that, they sell more: it's shit, it's obsolete, it's ridiculous.
When I arrive -- and I take one minute, I am not so intelligent -- when I arrive at the level of animal species, that becomes real interesting.
Voice offstage: Four point five.
Because every generation thinks we are the final one.
The first, if you want -- there is so many -- but one which is very easy to do, is the duty of vision.
It's OK. You start to be in the territory of intelligence, we can say.
There is some danger, there is some trap. One trap: the vertical.
Never forget -- like that, like that.
Because some cycle, there is a spot in the cycle, and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle.
That's why we must adapt.
And because we must all work to finish this story.
Foreign policy, you can figure that out by watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody, but — — I want to talk about young people and structure, young people and structure.
They all come from homes where there is, for the most part, just one person in the home, usually the mother or the grandmother, and that's it, and they come here for their education and for their structure.
And the thing about it, I've done this for years, the younger they are, the more fun it is.
Try it with your kids. See if it works.
But then the most amazing thing happens over time.
But you'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure.
But the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child's heart and soul to begin with.
That's when you start to imprint on the child that "you are special, you are different from every other child in the world.
I have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript from kindergarten through college.
That's what's going on. And that's what I found.
So they shipped me off to the army, and lo and behold, many years later, I'm considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had.
They had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx, but they had more than just expectations for us.
They never went to the bathroom. They never cooked.
And it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people, and I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren, it's not enough. You've got to reach out and back and find kids like Mr. Cruz who can make it if you give them the structure, if you reach back and help, if you mentor, if you invest in boys and girls clubs, if you work with your school system, make sure it's the best school system, and not just your kid's school, but the school uptown in Harlem, not just downtown Montessori on the West Side.
We touch every nation. Every nation touches us.
In those days, I had five bodyguards around me and three New York City police cars would roll alongside to make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue.
Reputations are volatile. Loyalties are fickle.
In fact, they have more control over the loss of control than ever before.
When Microsoft Kinect came out, the motion-controlled add-on to its Xbox gaming console, it immediately drew the attention of hackers.
Companies can give people more control, but they can also give them less control.
At Frog, the company I work for, we hold internal speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees, helping them get to know each other fast.
Thank you.
If you look at the scene, Egypt, for 30 years, had been in a downhill -- going into a downhill.
Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians that I have to thank for being so brave -- going into protests as a couple of hundred, getting beaten up and arrested.
I still remember the photo.
And everyone started to think that "this guy could be my brother."
It was an amazing story -- how everyone started feeling the ownership.
But did the regime learn anything? Not really.
The Tunisian experiment, as Amir was saying, inspired all of us, showed us that there is a way.
I was detained for 12 days, blindfolded, handcuffed.
It was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights.
We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games.
And she's talking to her baby.
No scientists dispute this curve, but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way.
We're culture-bound listeners.
So there are two things going on.
So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture-bound listeners that we are.
Six to eight months, they're totally equivalent.
But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.
We want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions, as opposed to in front of human beings.
Thank you.
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects.
I agree, it looks pretty amazing.
Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior.
This is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles inside the liquid.
This image, and also this one, were made using whiskey.
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel.
So what happened is that the flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom, burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol.
I was so privileged to be able to teach in a hospice on the outskirts of Bangalore.
I looked into the face of one of these women, and I saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present.
It was the young women, the health aids, who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds.
And there are various facets.
And I realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience, from working with dying people and training caregivers, that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe.
The very word terror is global.
Another, which has been discovered by various researchers at Emory and at Davis and so on, is that compassion enhances our immune system.
It takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions.
The wound is just filled with maggots.
Mathematics is the science of patterns, and we study it to learn how to think logically, critically and creatively, but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated, and when our students ask, "Why are we learning this?"
In terms of applications, Fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often.
But check this out.
Now look at those numbers.
Together, they form a one-by-two rectangle.
Now, if we continue this process, we'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21, 21 by 34, and so on.
Before we went out as a tour, he went out solo and did it first.
Then he opened it up. "Born in Iran? Wait."
"Your grandfather has a parking violation. It's way overdue.
"Why would I do that?
Now, I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show.
"And in conclusion, win some, lose some."
I was in Dubai.
He goes, "I'm going to the Zara store. It's three miles away.
He's like, "Good stuff, man. Columbian. Top of the line. Top of the line."
Because he was standing there in like a cheap suit, thin mustache, staring at me.
So the type of magic I like, and I'm a magician, is a magic that uses technology to create illusions.
Marco Tempest: When asked about deception, he said this: Magic is the only honest profession.
Lady: I'll be ready in just a minute, darling.
Three cards, three chances.
Sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart.
Its composer called Debussy said that art was the greatest deception of all.
Well, there's a multitude of factors at play, but I think one of the key factors is that the tools that we currently have available to test whether a drug is going to work, whether it has efficacy, or whether it's going to be safe before we get it into human clinical trials, are failing us. They're not predicting what's going to happen in humans.
So if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies, we need to become cell architects.
There's been many people trying to grow cells in the lab.
And they experience them how they did in the body.
They stick, and then they try to go into the lung side from blood channel.
But mucus is actually very important.
Now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome.
Does it change the beating of your heart?
We could use them to learn more about diseases such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as SARS.
It does something else that's very important.
So how do we prevent them?
These are when.
"I want to give you a hug."
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.
I got a pencil you can borrow.
Now, as many of you may remember, the Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization which was very active in Italy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s.
Naturally, I didn't know that until the day she was arrested.
Because they had no idea.
But it was only when I interviewed Mario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades, the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro, Italian former prime minister, that I finally realized that terrorism is actually business.
And what I discovered is this parallel reality, another international economic system, which runs parallel to our own, which has been created by arms organizations since the end of World War II.
And here is the best example, the Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA, legally funded by the U.S. Congress, illegally funded by the Reagan administration via covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair.
And together they money-laundered their dirty business through the same channel.
It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire.
Now, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply, the U.S. money supply is the amount of dollars that the Federal Reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars, which, of course, reflects the growth of the economy.
No other country can do that.
Why did this happen? This happened because the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation.
And believe me, it's going to be scary.
I didn't always like her, but I did respect her, and she taught me a heck of a lot.
I thought there were them and there were us, and I was not one of them.
I sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary, the one that I wanted, a life of adventure, and the one that I was actually heading for which was a nice, normal, pleasant life, but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life.
All four of my oars broke before I reached halfway across.
I suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my bottom.
So this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind.
So, how do you top rowing across the Atlantic?
By the time I get to Australia, if I get to Australia, I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all.
I lost and got airlifted.
But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean, which is what happened to it.
So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.
And, the following year, set out on the second stage of the Pacific, from Hawaii down to Tarawa.
Very shortly, I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia, and if I'm successful, I'll be the first woman ever to row solo all the way across the Pacific.
At the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff, that we need oil.
And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist.
We have a choice. We've been blessed, or cursed, with free will.
Is it something that we survive?
He thought it was transmitted by mosquitos.
They signed this document, and it's called an informed consent document.
So this is my grandfather. I actually never met him, but he's holding my mom, and his genes are in me, right?
A computer scientist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.
And three out of the four drugs we give you if you get cancer fail. And this is personal to me.
So I could show you mine. It's just A's, T's, C's and G's.
Right. But look at how non-computable this information is.
So Vanderbilt ran a study asking people, we'd like to take your biosamples, your blood, and share them in a biobank, and only five percent of the people opted out.
And I've spent a lot of time around other commons.
And if you'd like to build corporate structures on top of it, that's okay too. That's all in the consent, so if you don't like those terms, you don't come in.
And we're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months that lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there.
You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it.
And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.
It's too late. That is gone.
Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.
Why do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.
This is just the outline of it, and you can see, does it look like a regular building? No.
Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer, a program that says, manufacture these parts.
Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance, these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York, as part of their young architects summer series.
All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck, and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people, only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.
And they were able to do it. That was their design, using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts, a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.
It transforms through the magic of lighting.
Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines, all explained to you by color and texture on the wall.
Do you remember when we used to go up to Kiteflyer's Hill? Those summer nights, so still with all of the city beneath us and all of our lives ahead before cruel and foolish words were cruelly and foolishly said Some nights I think of you and then I go up on Kiteflyer's Hill wrapped up against the winter chill And somewhere in the city beneath me you lie asleep in your bed and I wonder if ever just briefly do I creep in your dreams now and then Where are you now? My wild summer love Where are you now? Have the years been kind? And do you think of me sometimes up on Kiteflyer's Hill? Oh, I pray you one day will We won't say a word We won't need them Sometimes silence is best We'll just stand in the still of the evening and whisper farewell to loneliness Where are you now? My wild summer love Where are you now? Do you think of me sometimes? And do you ever make that climb? Where are you now? My wild summer love Where are you now? Have the years been kind? And do you ever make that climb up on Kiteflyer's Hill? Kiteflyer's ... [French] Where are you? Where are you now? Where are you now? Kiteflyer's ... Gracias. Thank you very much.
And at the same time we were being told what we were, we were being asked, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
And when I was 10, I was told that my parents left because they didn't want me.
We were being told that we somehow must become what we are not, sacrificing what we are to inherit the masquerade of what we will be.
I was going to be The Garbage Man.
When I was 19, I wrote, "I will love myself despite the ease with which I lean toward the opposite."
I told her, whenever I'm sad, my grandmother gives me karate chops.
But the school halls were a battleground.
He tried to kill himself in grade 10 when a kid who could still go home to Mom and Dad had the audacity to tell him, "Get over it."
It was practice, and yes, some of us fell.
We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them.
It was coming straight for me. I had to. It was, yeah.
But that's cheating.
So the polyphony problem: I've only got one voice.
It is possible, and you can do it very simply using this machine. It's really fantastic. Check it out.
Like this.
The background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis.
Four years ago I worked with a few people at the Brookings Institute, and I arrived at a conclusion.
That's something you live inside of every day.
Okay, for the last piece I'd like to do, this one goes very similar to this.
All across the boreal, we're blessed with this incredible abundance of wetlands.
Now you've probably heard about the Porcupine caribou herd in the context of its breeding ground in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Now, here you see -- of course, as you go further on, these trucks become like a pixel.
It impacts and fragments a larger part of the wilderness, where there is 90 percent reduction of key species, like woodland caribou and grizzly bears, and it consumes even more energy, more water, and produces at least as much greenhouse gas.
That's creating the largest toxic impoundments in the history of the planet.
In Fort Chippewa, the 800 people there, are finding toxins in the food chain, this has been scientifically proven.
The boreal forest is also perhaps our best defense against global warming and climate change.
Just 70 miles downstream is the world's largest freshwater delta, the Peace-Athabasca Delta, the only one at the juncture of all four migratory flyways.
This would put a pipeline to take natural gas from the Beaufort Sea through the heart of the third largest watershed basin in the world, and the only one which is 95 percent intact.
The world does not need any more pipelines to wed our addiction to fossil fuels.
I thought it might be interesting, even for the many long-time collectors here with us at TED, local collectors, to have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists I wish everyone at TED to know.
These comics are a fundamental way that children, especially in the diaspora, learn their religious and mythological folk tales.
He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition.
I'm kind of cheating with this next artist since Raqs Media Collective are really three artists working together.
And light and shadow are a very important part of her work.
Again, this is not an optical trick. This is what you would see. In other words, it's not a camera cut. It's a perceptual trick.
Do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up? It's completely static.
OK now. Arthur [Ganson] hasn't talked yet, but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside. And so, we -- Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur Ganson.
And this is what happens to that food web when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before.
So the more you step back, embrace complexity, the better chance you have of finding simple answers, and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with.
The circled node is the one we're trying to influence -- popular support for the government.
Thank you.
Your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes.
I mean, I want games to be a force for good in the world.
Number four: I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self.
They help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from, if we weren't playing games together.
For me that meant no reading, no writing, no video games, no work or email, no running, no alcohol, no caffeine.
And I wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real-life challenge, so I created a role-playing recovery game called Jane the Concussion Slayer.
Now it wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms.
They talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family.
But scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely.
It seems that somehow, a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets.
We're going to play a quick game together.
That's all it takes.
Baby dolphin and baby llamas. Everybody look.
All right, pick one, last quest: Shake someone's hand for six seconds, or send someone a quick thank you by text, email, Facebook or Twitter. Go!
Okay, well you have successfully completed your four quests, so let's see if I've successfully completed my mission to give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life.
You still have your special mission, your secret mission.
And with 10 extra years, you might even have enough time to play a few more games.
Just to give you an idea of scale, that installation there is about six feet across, and the tallest models are about two or three feet high.
And if the bleaching doesn't go away -- if the temperatures don't go down -- reefs start to die.
And I, naively by this stage, said, "Oh, yes, sure."
So the whole thing has sort of morphed into this organic, ever-evolving creature, that's actually gone way beyond Christine and I.
So what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody?
So what is this impossible hyperbolic structure?
And you all know the answer. Does someone want to shout it out?
They've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness, it's called a geodesic.
Does anyone want to guess what it is?
How could they see this?
I've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface.
And so, too, we've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures.
But why? What's at stake here? What does it matter?
And he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right.
Here is this mass of jelly, three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand, and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.
So you can then map function onto structure, and then find out what the circuitry's doing to generate that particular function.
I mean, you know it's you because you wink and it winks, and you know it's a mirror, but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself.
I'm not saying I believe this, but this is the standard Freudian view.
Now, you try using the Freudian explanation there.
So my idea was, when this chap looks at an object, when he looks at his -- any object for that matter, it goes to the visual areas and, however, and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus, and you recognize it as a pea plant, or a table, or your mother, for that matter, OK?
Well, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen, and measure your galvanic skin response, and show pictures on the screen, I can measure how you sweat when you see an object, like a table or an umbrella. Of course, you don't sweat.
By the way, if this patient then goes, and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him -- and he picks up the phone, and he says, "Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?"
And you all know what a phantom limb is.
These are very compelling, vivid sensations.
The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed, was cut, by say, a motorcycle accident.
Move. No. Move. No. Move. No.
So, I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars, but don't tell my funding agencies.
I said, "Move your normal hand."
So, I said, OK, this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input, but I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb.
I said, "What's gone?"
Now, why does this happen?
But, it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis, and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors.
Why does this happen?
It's never been answered before.
So, every time you see a number, you see a corresponding color, and that's why you get synesthesia.
OK, it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia.
How many of you think that's Buba, that's Kiki? Raise your hands.
So, this area is about eight times the size in higher -- especially in humans -- as in lower primates.
And they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior.
But I don't think that we were that way initially.
But there are a lot of similarities.
Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.
Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.
You can use the lighter to start the fire.
Good job.
Like us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her.
Realizing that Nyota might get hurt, Panbanisha, like any human mother, carefully tugs to get the scissors back.
The flat sharp edges are like knife blades.
She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor.
SS : Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha.
Soon she began to write as well.
Now watch out, stay away from them now.
We're learning how to communicate with them, in really high-pitched tones.
And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning, to set our Earth in a cosmic context.
If we go beyond our solar system, we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.
Each is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda, which looks so small and faint because its light has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.
If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here: an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left -- the world of the quantum -- and on the right the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies.
And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small, which we don't yet have.
You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small, but we want to understand the very complex.
And so, this makes this coming century a challenge.
First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones.
He persuaded Einstein, as his last act, to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.
There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there, experiencing the sun's demise, but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria.
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years, but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth.
Change has accelerated as human populations rose.
Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future?
I'm at a business school, so that's what we do.
So I told you that it ruins people's lives and that their friends bug them.
We asked them how happy they were, and then we gave them an envelope.
We called them up at night and asked them, "What'd you spend it on, and how happy do you feel now?"
People who spent money on other people got happier.
We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries.
Here's a guy from Canada.
She says, "I bought a present for my mom.
This is a real medical need, literally a life-saving donation.
So almost everywhere we look we see that giving money away makes you happier than keeping it for yourself.
And then we can see, well now we've got teams that spend on themselves and we've got these prosocial teams who we give money to make the team a little bit better.
And I know what you're all thinking about are dodgeball teams.
The implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product and that's the way to make yourself happier.
and more about "If I've got five dollars or 15 dollars, what can I do to benefit other people?"
Two days it took the Times Online to make a map, a mashable map -- we call these things mash-ups -- a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected.
This is U.K. government data, a completely independent site, Where Does My Money Go.
Well, for example, if you have lots of data about places you can take, from a postcode -- which is like a zip plus four -- for a specific group of houses, you can make paper, print off a paper which has got very, very specific things about the bus stops, the things specifically near you.
We're focusing now on Port-au-Prince.
Like the United States, it has about 311 million people, and of that 311 million people, it turns out 144,000 are called Lester.
You don't necessarily have to win, but you must do extremely well.
The United States also looks like this, also has two elections, one we called the general election, the second we should call the money election.
In this sense, the funders are our Lesters.
Okay, the United States is Lesterland, point number one.
Now, by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of Congress.
Now, there's good news and bad news about this corruption.
Okay, now, every single one of you knows this.
Grab that issue, sit it down in front of you, look straight in its eyes, and tell it there is no Christmas this year.
To do this would require a single statute, a statute establishing what we think of as small dollar funded elections, a statute of citizen-funded campaigns, and there's any number of these proposals out there: Fair Elections Now Act, the American Anti-Corruption Act, an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project to give vouchers to people to fund elections, an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act.
But I don't buy it.
Because if you want to kickstart reform, look, I could kickstart reform at half the price of fixing energy policy, I could give you back a republic.
Nothing you can do."
Because if you do, then what the hell are you, what are the hell are we doing?
With it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space.
For example, some here will remember this day, June 1958, the National Civil Defense Drill, where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.
And I'd like to thank you all.
They're just practicing.
When I got out I had a choice.
So it wasn't all the good side of the illness.
Everyone is just a little bit mad.
So I didn't expect that, but -- I mean, I expected you could synchronize.
Do you need to be alive? I mean, that's a spooky thought, right?
Second, all the individuals have a tendency to line up.
And you see that in nature.
Information can be sent over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism.
We would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works and to understand, you know, exactly where this organization comes from.
In a second I'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly so that you can get a sense. This is a single frame.
But I hope you've convinced yourself now, with this nighttime video, that they really were very well synchronized.
If you have epilepsy, there is an instance of billions of brain cells, or at least millions, discharging in pathological concert.
This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles.
All right. So there we go. Let's see. OK, I'm not trying to cheat -- let me start them out of sync. No, hard to even do that.
So they built the blade of light, and it's a very thin ribbon of steel, the world's -- probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is, with cables that are out on the side.
Interviewer: And not forwards and backwards? Boy: No.
Interviewer: Ah! Now, tell me why you had to do this?
Think of the people as being like metronomes.
Engineer: Absolutely. Interviewer: You thought, "Oh, bother."
Now, Allan, this is all your fault, isn't it? Allan McRobie: Yes.
AM: It certainly affects the way you walk, yes. You can't walk normally on it.
What he understood was that biological diversity -- crop diversity -- is the biological foundation of agriculture.
So, let me show you a picture of one form of diversity.
In the United States, in the 1800s -- that's where we have the best data -- farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100 named varieties of apples.
The good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand. Your apple's still out there.
And then he has to go even further.
It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good, unique trait.
If agriculture hasn't experienced that, how could it be adapted?
But the most interesting thing about South Africa is we don't have to wait for 2070 for there to be trouble.
To Svalbard, in fact.
This is more than just an artist's dream, it's now a reality.
in this place there.
Norway owns the mountain and the facility, but the depositors own the seed.
Because, quite literally, if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change, neither will we.
We need to catalog it. It's a library of life, but right now I would say we don't have a card catalog for it.
If you are scared by global warming, wait until we learn about local warming.
This is a very serious newspaper; it's Times of England -- very serious. This is a very -- -- gentlemen and ladies, be serious.
And this research is being precipitated by the U.S. government, so you can see that your tax man is working for good causes.
You cannot use this picture.
We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future.
Let's take a snapshot at aviation.
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation -- I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere -- you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.
Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that, something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me -- a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research, our communication and, if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list.
The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly, and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.
You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones.
100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost, or less -- this is going to be very profitable.
Why is this happening?
So I've started working with a few hundred kids, and I came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age, to be bathed in bits.
Now, this is openness in the sense of the boundaries of organizations becoming more porous and fluid and open.
He takes over this gold mine, and his geologists can't tell him where the gold is.
You know, conventional wisdom says talent is inside, right?
This is a new means of production in the making.
You know? Or if you're going to be naked, you'd better get buff.
Now this is different than transparency.
The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble.
Knowledge and intelligence is power, and as it becomes more distributed, there's a concomitant distribution and decentralization and disaggregation of power that's underway in the world today.
You can see this playing out today in Egypt.
People didn't know about things.
And now, once again, the technology genie is out of the bottle, but this time it's different.
Starlings, in the area around Edinburgh, in the moors of England, come in something called a murmuration, and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds, and throughout the day the starlings are out over a 20-mile radius sort of doing their starling thing.
It's an openness, it's a sharing of all kinds of information, not just about location and trajectory and danger and so on, but about food sources.
And I look at this thing, and, I don't know, I get a lot of hope that maybe this smaller, networked, open world that our kids inherit might be a better one, and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited.
Now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they're growing in.
But what we now know is that for a number of diseases, there are defects in the system where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels or can't grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time.
And this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer.
And we can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal, healthy vessels we see in other places of the body: They're abnormal; they're very poorly constructed; and, because of that, they're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them.
And within a few weeks of treatment, we were able to slow down that cancer's growth such that we were ultimately able to extend milo's survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted, all with a very good quality of life.
It had already spread to his lymph nodes, so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail, so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside.
That's impressive.
But I actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking: What could we be adding to our diet that's naturally antiangiogenic, that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers?
Here's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries; it potently inhibits angiogenesis.
Here's some more data from our testing.
Check out this ad from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota.
Restart the treatment, loses the weight again.
I have a quick question for you. So these drugs aren't exactly ...
And what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day.
I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine.
I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet that's been folded just once.
I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.
And "right answer," of course there might be more than one right answer; many puzzles have more than one.
And it's all part of the same design.
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.
Thank you very much.
The goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right.
This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides Rubik's cube.
Now we'll make it harder, a little harder.
It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece, a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.
And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA?"
She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.
It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.
Everybody now considers themselves a creator, and not just a viewer.
Let's see how well we can do. There are three images.
Anybody?
And I want to call it the girl cell.
How do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy?
So, we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening.
I remember, for example, when my father, who was very, very violent, used to beat me.
To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess.
I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves.
The state of girls, the condition of girls, will, in my belief -- and that's the girl inside us and the girl in the world -- determine whether the species survives.
There is a girl, Julia Butterfly Hill, who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks.
It's my baby and it's full of love."
So, for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley.
She's changed the rules.
When her father saw her and saw who she had become, in her full girl self, he threw his arms around her and broke down crying.
And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here.
This is for her: I love being a girl.
I love that I do not take things lightly.
I rejoice that it's still in my body.
It's how the earth got made, how the wind continues to pollinate.
And I love, hear me, I love, love, love being a girl.
They found photos of him. They prepared a photo array, and the day after the shooting, they showed it to one of the teenagers, and he said, "That's the picture.
Under the best of observation conditions, the absolute best, we only detect, encode and store in our brains bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us, and they're stored in different parts of the brain.
Well, when you read through the case materials in this Carrillo case, one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that the investigating officers said the lighting was good at the crime scene, at the shooting.
The teenagers said they could see very well.
Now I may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request — — but nonetheless, it's to this man's credit and his courage that he said, "Yes, I will."
That's 30 feet away.
You'll notice, which was also in my test report, all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side, which means that the shooter's face would have been photo-occluded. It would have been backlit.
He is now a freed man.
It's very different than most other cultures. All right?
A Swedish mathematician, von Koch, decided that instead of subtracting lines, he would add them.
And that worked for a hundred years.
So nature has this self-similar structure.
And as you go through the path, you have to get more and more polite.
And of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village, right?
I think something's going on there."
Now, you might ask yourself three questions at this point.
It is not the same pattern at two different scales.
And with each iteration of that algorithm, you learn the iterations of the myth.
But here in Africa, you've got these nonlinear scaling fences.
And I measured out the lengths of straw, put it on a log-log plot, got the scaling exponent, and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height in the wind engineering handbook.
And finally, out of desperation, I said, "Well, let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877."
Odd plus even gives you odd.
Leibniz, the German mathematician, talked about geomancy in his dissertation called "De Combinatoria."
We've focused in the U.S. on African-American students as well as Native American and Latino.
It's in the -- it's in Google's search engine.
Just when our kids stop teething, they start having tantrums.
I spent the last few years trying to answer that question, traveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars, experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets.
What the Starrs did next, though, was surprising.
So what is Agile, and why can it help with something that seems so different, like families?
As Sutherland told me, we got to that article, and said, "That's it."
Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever.
He said, "You can't underestimate the power of doing this."
Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.
I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met.
We have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus or other family experts.
And the truth is, recent research backs him up.
So move where you sit. That's adaptability.
Enlist the children in their own upbringing.
Every minute above that, we have to do one pushup.
The point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms, and yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms.
Collins coached us on doing something that businesses do, which is define your mission and identify your core values.
Another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from.
If you give children this happy narrative, you give them the tools to make themselves happier.
When Leo Tolstoy was five years old, his brother Nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick, which he had hidden in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.
You just need to take small steps, accumulate small wins, keep reaching for that green stick.
Not anymore.
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience, what's occurred is that we're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits.
Well, the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface.
It could be anything that's anti-icing, because if you don't have water, you don't have ice.
And that guy, "Seven Years in Tibet," turned out to be a Nazi. Sweeney: Yeah.
I mean, I watch Oprah mostly when I'm home in Spokane visiting my mother. And to my mother, Oprah is a greater moral authority than the Pope, which is actually saying something because she's a devout Catholic.
And all I'm saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell-Mann would go on Oprah and just explain to her that the law of attraction is, in fact, not a law.
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy.
Where other scientists would play in their laboratory, Tesla created his inventions in his mind.
I have been able, through careful invention, to transmit, with the mere flick of a switch, electricity across the ether.
NT: They wouldn't give me the money.
Tesla became the man who lit the world, but this was only the beginning.
So, organisms have this important history.
They all work like this kangaroo, they bounce.
We got some of the best mathematicians in the world from Princeton to work on this problem.
Think about the typical kind of robot that you see.
It just bends by itself beautifully.
It actually leaps into the air, and has aerial phases when it does it, like a horse, and you'll see it's bouncing here.
It has six legs -- there are the tuned, springy legs.
RF: Here's it going down a pathway.
Now, I want you to look at the animal's back.
And here's the peeling action of the Mecho-Gecko.
And if you blow those up, they have these little structures on the end.
Do they do it by interlocking? That's kind of a like a Velcro-like thing.
We also presented to Nike even.
We don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in, where career choices for women were so limited.
We also have another problem, which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment.
And he looked at me, and he said, "Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom."
My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce, and I think there are three.
I wish I could do that now.
And Carrie says, "Boy, I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic."
If you ask men why they did a good job, they'll say, "I'm awesome.
Because what the data shows, above all else, is one thing, which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women.
The bad news was that everyone liked Howard.
I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees, and a couple hours later, there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk, and she wanted to talk to me.
Message number two: make your partner a real partner.
And literally from that moment, she doesn't raise her hand anymore, she doesn't look for a promotion, she doesn't take on the new project, she doesn't say, "Me. I want to do that."
It needs to be rewarding.
But I'm hopeful that future generations can.
Even doctors are patients at some point.
I mean, they complain about it all the time.
People brush and floss their teeth.
The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick.
They wanted to capture one other variable, which was the patients' sense of efficacy.
I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night, and he's like, "Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?"
And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we're inundated with.
So I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works.
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent.
This is a pharmaceutical ad.
There is no good faith in this.
It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what, but you get the statistics for how effective it is.
They're packed with information.
We tell you that you're okay, you're normal.
So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page, which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it.
It's used to test for prostate cancer, but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged.
Now this is not a problem of resources; this is a problem of incentives.
Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions: Can I have my results?
And engagement is essential here, because it's not just giving them information; it's giving them an opportunity to act.
I want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals, and tell you about a tool, a very simple tool that I have found.
And the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden, working alongside that bumblebee, was: what did I and that bumblebee have in common?
And suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience.
Now, the test of any idea -- I said it was a literary conceit -- is what does it get us?
We are still Cartesians -- the children of Descartes -- who believe that subjectivity, consciousness, sets us apart; that the world is divided into subjects and objects; that there is nature on one side, culture on another.
So what plants have -- while we have consciousness, tool making, language, they have biochemistry.
Now, the other use of this is practical.
And I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm, and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature.
The only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing: relatively new, hooked to a car battery; even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock, set it up in 15 minutes.
Very useful second ecosystem service.
This is how the prairies were built, the relationship between bison and grasses.
Thank you very much.
Why didn't Dad say art? Why wasn't it okay?
I have a power manager, mouse driver, memory, etc., and I built this in Kyoto, the old capital of Japan.
And I'll talk about how I've looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis, a kind of experiment.
Text first, then images, we waited, CD-quality sound over the Net, then movies over the Internet. Kind of incredible.
So you can see how you change the scale, you change the form. Content is the same, but you feel differently.
It's very classy. It's like that expensive restaurant, Fear.
And they'd say, "Daddy, why doesn't the computer respond to sound?"
This is, like, a ring of letters.
By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art, and art is a wonderful thing, fine art, pure art.
And many people ask me, John, couldn't you just digitize all this? Make it all digital? Wouldn't it be better?
It's about something in between.
My favorite ones are "no plants." Why would you bring a plant to a national monument? I'm not sure.
Someone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes.
It's because leaders, what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen, and in that room I found so many connections between people across all of London, and so leadership, connecting people, is the great question today.
I am a proud Princeton dropout.
It's not very good. It's cluttered.
Just before we jump into that, there's sort of a question of: why is this important?
And if you're happy with that, fantastic.
And so it's incredibly critical that at this moment, while it's just getting constructed, while the frameworks like Facebook, like the Open Graph, are being created for the game layer equivalent, that we think about it very consciously, and that we do it in a way that is open, that is available, and that can be leveraged for good.
And this is a dynamic in which to succeed, players have to do something at a predefined time, generally at a predefined place.
It also exists in more conventional game forms.
But this could also be used for good.
And this is used in games as well.
But let's use it consciously. Like why have games that you can lose?
We will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen.
It can also be used in very compelling ways for good.
Digg is a communal dynamic to try to find and source the best news, the most interesting stories.
But it can also be used to find real things.
It is very powerful. It is very exciting.
Audience: It's people logging on to Google around the world.
But basically, what we've noticed is these queries, which come in at thousands per second, are available everywhere there is power.
Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like.
In the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.
But partly, we want to make the world a better place, and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation, and we're in the process of setting that up.
This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?
So this is what he built.
There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these.
So many, many useful things come out of this.
And this was kind of a surprise to me, but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head, which you did by writing them down, that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources.
And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom, and you can do searches really easily.
And as we become more of a global company, we find these things really affect us -- you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room?
And I think we've done a good job encouraging that.
And these ads are generated automatically -- like in this case, on the Washington Post -- from the content on the site.
And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search, you really have to be smart.
So we decided -- actually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you.
And then we produced "You suck."
Again, 18 months later, the product was obsolete.
Now this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, designed many great things in his career in the 19th century, including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe.
He imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in London and disembark from a ship in New York.
As our industrial society matured, so design became a profession and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics, image and fashion.
What makes life easier, more enjoyable?
So if human need is the place to start, then design thinking rapidly moves on to learning by making.
These are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts.
By the time he wrote his third report, he confessed that he had failed and instead had created a society of welfare consumers.
And in these times of change, we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.
And one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund, in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
So for me, this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that I was working on at the beginning of my career.
So I'd like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference, that it can help create new ideas and new innovations, beyond the latest High Street products.
"I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom.
This was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice.
As I do so, I hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds.
The first group came in, and they were greeted by Miss Smith, who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.
To insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships.
Here, I interviewed people who were residents of formerly communist countries, who had all faced the challenge of transitioning to a more democratic and capitalistic society.
You know, research shows repeatedly that we can't actually tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi.
Bohdan from Kiev said, in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace, "It is too much.
In fact, though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice, we don't all see choice in the same places or to the same extent.
Yet still, many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them.
If she survived, she would remain in a permanent vegetative state, never able to walk, talk or interact with others.
Even up to a year later, American parents were more likely to express negative emotions, as compared to their French counterparts.
But the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn't always work out that way.
And this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism.
And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days.
"What does it look like?"
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick, of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles.
But what about natural forces?
If you're multiplying the rig, so you multiply how many layers of absorbent you're using, you can collect a lot more.
And, playing, I realized that the maneuverability of this was really amazing, and I could avoid an obstacle at the very last second, more maneuverable than a normal boat.
We went from a back rudder to a front rudder to two rudders to multiple rudders to the whole boat changing shape, and the more we are moving forward, and the more the design looks simple and cute.
The other thing is, most boats, when they reach a certain speed, and they are going on waves, they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water, and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost.
So what is open hardware?
Less than one week after, this is a team in Eindhoven, it's a school of engineering.
We have the people so we need to protect each other, yes, and we're a technology company, and profit is necessary to make this happen.
This is what our teammates, we dream of at night.
To get a sense of this, and it's been a theme we've talked about all week, I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners.
Girl 4: I wouldn't like it.
But they were onto something and they got better at it.
I mean, how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media?
Calvin Bolster: Well, Ed, this problem concerns the Navy's Viking rocket.
CB: Looks very good to me.
In a mass raid, high-speed bombers could be in on us before we could determine their tracks.
This had the first pointing device. It was distributed, so it worked out -- distributed computing and modems -- so all these things could talk to each other.
So -- and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs.
A new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls and they're quite certain that television is about to do them in.
Turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your Winky Dink Magic Window, other crayons may discolor or hurt the window.
Marshall McLuhan: If the audience can become involved in the actual process of making the ad, then it's happy. It's like the old quiz shows.
And so the global village is as big as a planet, and as small as a village post office.
In the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks, a group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy, a computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab, and Doug Engelbart, a computer scientist at SRI, changed the world.
They saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build.
HyperCard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks, where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture, or piece of text, or data across a file system, and we had no way of explaining it.
The method we illustrate in this video uses a pre-made videodisc but creates custom HyperCard stacks.
The year is 1993 and he was working on a book and I was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this.
The world and all its culture reduced to bits, the lingua franca of all media.
Thomas Edison had the same problem.
PH: In my own company, Technorati, we see something like 67,000 blog posts an hour come in.
But I, yeah, I think there's an opportunity. As the strike continues, there's an opportunity for more people to experience video on places like MySpace TV.
Voice 2: Well, there goes the neighborhood.
And media companies realize the audience is important also.
MM: The medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this.
I spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for design, and studying design in the public sector.
And since that time in Amsterdam, I spent an increasing amount of time in the cities, looking at design for common evidence of design that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature.
They give me, I don't know, a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve.
Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy.
I don't always know why I take photographs of things.
And Cuba needs to be far more resourceful, because of the blockades and things, but a really wonderful playground.
And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know, the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it, and it's just my call to say to all of us, public policy won't change this at all; private industry has to work to take things like this seriously.
And I came outside, and the valets for this car service had created, you know, quite a nice little collage of these car keys, and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that I had seen in Tokyo.
A lot of the planning departments became subordinated to the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars as it is on Wal-Mart; I'm not going to do that.
When I was five years old I fell in love with airplanes.
It's the way I got a part of this romance.
And I decided I had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes.
So I had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings -- the shape of the wing, the shape of the fuselage and so on -- and build an airplane over these drawings that I knew followed some of the principles of flying.
And he said, "Well for one thing, there are more girls there."
So after 25 years I began to feel as though I was running dry.
And I found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that I used to use on the airplane.
When I started this chair it was not a preconceived notion.
She said, "But it's too high."
The other thing I felt was that armrests had never really been properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life.
No arms at all.
All the weight of your upper torso -- your arms, your head -- goes right down through your back, your spine, into those bones when you sit.
Well if you're reclined a great deal, you have to use muscle force to hold your head there.
So that part of it took a long time to work out.
In fact, probably adding them all together, the mosquito has killed more humans.
Now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is, for those who don't know.
What they're very good at doing is hitchhiking, particularly the eggs.
I mean, that can't be very difficult.
You could do the same with a space spray.
It has to be safe.
But you don't want to get all of the insects.
So basically, we've used those two factors.
So this is technology that was developed in Oxford University a few years ago.
And now what we're doing is we're going through a process to scale up to a town of about 50,000, so we can see this work at big scale.
And although the techniques are similar, the outcomes are very, very different, and if you take our approach, for example, and you compare it to, say, G.M. crops, both techniques are trying to produce a massive benefit.
I started asking my questions, "Well, why me?"
I mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right?
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work.
And if you've been in that part of the country, this is what those piles of burning, smoldering coal waste look like.
Very nice, and there my older, senior lungs, as I like to call them, I filled with particulate matter, carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone.
Look at the kind of data that's available.
They give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck.
What I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions.
With that, I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago.
I just wish it were more organized."
Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people.
One, two, three.
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the World Wide Web is as wise, as wild and as organized as I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee, you want to bet just how whack and un-PC your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net?

And by the end of my presentation, I hope that the general public will be more aware of this crisis and this issue.
Cell membranes are phosphorus-based: These are called phospholipids.
Some are happier than others.
Only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant. Eighty-five percent is lost.
Now, where will we get this phosphorus from?
We can use biofuels, or solar power, or hydropower, but phosphorus is an essential element, indispensable to life, and we can't replace it.
What are we to do? We are faced with a paradox.
It has led me to further my research and to use it as a model for my laboratory research.
It grows much faster, and is much better designed to seek out phosphorus.
To further support my argument, here is a picture that speaks for itself.
The black rectangle is the plot from which the mycorrhiza was added.
So if you were to ask me what my retirement dream is, which will be at the moment we reach that phosphorus peak, it would be that we use one label, "Made with mycorrhiza," and that my children and grandchildren buy products bearing that label too.
So, examples like Christopher Wren's King's Cross: you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines, so you're really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form.
My hero is actually not Darwin; it's a guy named William Bateson, father of Greg Bateson, who was here for a long time in Monterey.
So, this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and generic form.
It's just a curve without inflection.
So the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume, when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista.
At the same time, there's a person paying 30,000 dollars for a 300-series car, and a person paying 70,000 dollars for a 700 series, and that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom-of-the-market car.
That way, each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars, and get incredible variation in the components.
So, when doing a center for the national parks in Costa Rica, we tried to use that idea of a gradient color and a change in texture as the structure moves across the surface of the building.
And we looked at, from the 1950s on, there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing.
The steel industry is so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of beams and columns all rolled together into a single system which is highly efficient, but also produces decorative effects and formal effects that are very beautiful and organic.
If you look really carefully in the upper right-hand corner, you're going to see a thin white line, which is a road that was built in the 1970s.
So soybeans have really exploded, showing how trade and globalization are really responsible for the connections to rainforests and the Amazon -- an incredibly strange and interconnected world that we have today.
That area's about 30 million square kilometers, or about an Africa's worth of land, a huge amount of land, and it's the best land, of course, is what you see. And what's left is, like, the middle of the Sahara Desert, or Siberia, or the middle of a rain forest.
Those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains far to the east, where snow melts, it travels down the river through the desert, and forms the great Aral Sea.
This is not only a change in water and where the shoreline is, this is a change in the fundamentals of the environment of this region.
This is an environmental disaster writ large.
Usually when we think about the atmosphere, we think about climate change and greenhouse gases, and mostly around energy, but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases too.
And it rivals climate change in importance.
So you put these together. It's really hard to see how we're going to get to the rest of the century without at least doubling global agricultural production.
You see a lot of this in Africa, even Latin America, but interestingly, Eastern Europe, where Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries used to be, is still a mess agriculturally.
We need to figure out how to bring both of those together into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together.
That's almost the size of South America.
Or the Colorado River, which no longer flows to the ocean.
Here's the dilemma...
How do we feed the world without destroying it?
And I thought she'd say, "Oh, you know, up the lagoon somewhere, or maybe across Africa," but you'll be happy to know she said it came from here, it comes from the North Sea.
It's traditionally called the informal economy, the underground economy, the black market.
I had a friend who worked at a pickle factory, and the cucumbers would come flying down this conveyer belt, and his job was to pick off the ones that didn't look so good and throw them in the bin labeled "relish" where they'd be crushed and mixed with vinegar and used for other kinds of profit.
So the implications of that are vast, because it means that this is where employment is — 1.8 billion people — and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world, because people are actually able to earn money and live and thrive, as Andrew Saboru did.
Now, most of the phones there are not second-hand at all.
You can buy New York Yankees caps in all sorts of unauthorized patterns.
All over the world. And that company was the big German electronics giant Siemens.
And in particular, I want to talk about the design of diarrhea.
And a very closely related question, which is, how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answer to the first question?
If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility, then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms.
People will come in to those places where you've got contaminated drinking water, bring things back to the family, may drink right at that point.
Now, this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission, you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph.
One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism -- some that produce a lot of toxins, some that produce a little -- and take those strains and spew them out in different countries.
She got rehydration therapy, she perked up, within a few days she was looking like a completely different person.
And we found that in Chile -- within two months of the invasion of Peru you had strains entering Chile -- and when you look at those strains, in the very far left-hand side of this graph, you see a lot of variation in the toxin production.
And in Ecuador -- remember, this is the place where it has the highest potential waterborne transmission -- it looked like it got more harmful.
So, you've got a higher level of virulence.
Antibiotic sensitivity was going down.
In the case of waterborne transmission, we'd like to clean up the water supplies, see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness.
And this really cool experiment was done about 200 miles south of there, in Northern Alabama, by the Tennessee Valley Authority.
But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness.
We're dealing with living systems; we're dealing with systems that evolve.
And the data really do support this: that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness.
This is our motivation.
And we interact with the physical world with our hands.
So when you squish your shoulders, they pull on a bicycle cable.
Well how about with higher levels of amputation?
We built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago where we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints to get up to six motors, or six degrees of freedom.
And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it.
And he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches.
This is what happens when Jesse thinks open and close his hand, or bend or straighten your elbow.
On the right side, two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis -- which, by the way, is the same physical arm, just programmed a little different -- you can see that he's much faster and much smoother as he moves these little blocks.
Imagine sensors in the hand coming up and pressing on this new hand skin.
Please welcome Amanda Kitts.
TK: So it was a little slow?
TK: A little faster?
But I can't put in an electrode and say, "Go there."
And in fact, it feels even heavier, because it's not glued on the same.
If it stops working for some reason, I can retrain it.
What we do is have the patient go all the way open and think, "What hand grasp pattern do I want?"
Claudia: Oooooh!
You're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there, but our little motor's making all kinds of noise right next to my electrodes.
So it'll be the smallest and lightest and the smartest arm ever made.
That's science.
However, the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation, especially in the context of externally-funded research.
How then can we ensure that, in our search for the cure, we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic?
Now, this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy.
Local governments need to set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries, and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government and research sponsors.
Although she may not know this, my encounter with Celine has completely changed the way in which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries, and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done.
Now there are over 30,000.
But moreover, I'd never lived on an uninhabited island.
And I doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes.
We have less than we had before, and most of them are in fairly steep decline.
And so you can see this current coming up -- in this case, the Humboldt Current -- that comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands, and this deep undersea current, the Cromwell Current, that upwells around the Galapagos.
But this is a global phenomenon, we know that.
Here, you can see where Punta Tombo is, and they breed in incredibly dense colonies.
So they were just minding their own business.
In some years, like this year, we found more than 80 percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil.
This is climate change. Now this has really been a fun study because I put satellite tags on the back of these Magellanic penguins.
So it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago, and then you get transferred to St. Louis, and your mate is not happy about this because you've got to pay airfare, because you're gone longer.
This is really pretty weird."
You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode, so it tells you who it is.
This is my box up here, and this is the system that works.
That's probably more than at any time in centuries.
How do we distribute ourselves around the world?
Over 50 new countries were born.
As you can see on this map, Russia is still the largest country in the world.
So let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.
This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty, led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.
Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy?
And now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to China to lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.
Already ethnic Chinese people in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia are the real key factors and drivers in the economies there.
So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?
But what are they guarding?
In order to profit from its oil it has to export it through Turkey or Syria, and other countries, and Iraq itself.
That, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict.
Here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.
Because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian, north through Russia, and even east to China.
On average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year since the end of the Cold War.
In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already, and that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.
So what's next? Where are we going to see borders change and new countries born?
But let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.
Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.
Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging?
So the first thing you're going to see is the normal worm when it's about college student age -- a young adult.
But everything else is just lying there.
And when I tell people about this, they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person who looks really good for being 90 or 80.
And the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor.
So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself, speeding up aging.
And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.
And there are hints of this.
They hardly get cancer, and when they do it's not as severe.
They have the ability to protect themselves from many kinds of damage, which we think makes them live longer.
And that, we think, is registered by the animal as a danger signal, a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity.
And then the hurricane comes through, and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.
And that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit, we can increase the health and longevity of people.
And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse -- even when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human, that old for a mouse -- if you give the mouse rapamycin, it will live longer.
Although you're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me, what you could do now pretty well in the lab, if you were allowed ethically, is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer?
And also, there are other ways of activating FOXO that don't even involve insulin or IGF-1 that might even be safer.
And the 70 year-old ones, actually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places, and they also have more progeny every year.
And I'll give you some examples of what I mean.
Whereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn't want you involved with the planning process, otherwise their ads would look something like this -- with all the information basically laid out clearly.
This is the cover story.
And you might think this is a small thing, but I think it's important because it sets a tone and it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport.
Number two, it's imperfect; it's not very glamorous, and it doesn't suddenly start and suddenly end.
Charitable status: Groups who have charitable status in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy.
Quite the opposite: I actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care.
Yeah. I thought so. Not surprised.
But we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis.
So in this way, by doing this kind of test, we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particular behaviors, something that is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to do right now in humans.
It's one thing to believe that flies have emotion-like states, but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not?
You can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion.
So we decided to use our puff-o-mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs.
Indeed, if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate DEA license — oh my God -- — we find indeed that these cocaine-fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do, and that's also reminiscent of ADHD, which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin that act similarly to cocaine.
They flunk out of CalTech.
We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore, or cure, the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain.
And the answer is smell, the smell of her body.
Every 30 seconds, somewhere on this planet, a child dies of malaria, and Paul Levy this morning, he was talking about the metaphor of the 727 crashing into the United States.
That's right.
And I will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria.
And so we set up another crazy experiment, because we collected the smell of these larvae, put it on pieces of cloth, and then did something very remarkable.
My third story is perhaps even more remarkable, and, I should say, has never been shown to the public until today.
Just kidding, just kidding.
Now think of what we can do with this.
But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs, the gift of life was then extended from living, related donors to now living, unrelated donors.
And at each time, I would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me.
And in transplantation, concepts shifted from whole organs to cells.
Embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage, chiefly because of their pluripotency -- that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types.
And so guess what, scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells -- aging adult cells from you and me -- they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful IPS cells.
And I had my vision restored, but not before a prolonged period of convalescence -- three months -- in a head down position.
What lies ahead?
As we speak, the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the USFDA approval.
"Danzon No. 2."
And then they'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others' faces and do the "Macarena," and we'll be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time -- even though we know, statistically, half of them will be divorced within a decade.
What are they doing right?
ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are.
Because we needed a study to tell us this.
They didn't take 300 shots of you in that rapid-fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest, smileyest one for the Christmas card.
And it's not just successfully starring in films that's dangerous.
My husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony.
So I've got all those things going for me.
I control the brain in order to understand how it works.
There's 10,000 neurons here.
We need to rearrange the pattern.
Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current.
You don't need to know where these receivers are, and it doesn't matter if these receivers move -- just think of the stereo in your car.
Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor, the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on, and the neuron fires electrical impulses.
Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain expressed the light-activated pore.
Now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model, we constructed a simple one-dimensional world for our favorite subject, fruit flies.
Now obviously, the Critic is a key ingredient in what makes us intelligent.
Here's what happened in two instances: We're comparing two strains of flies, each of them having about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains, shown here in green on the left and on the right.
Through many such experiments, we were able to narrow down the identity of the Critic to just 12 cells.
What the Actor does with this information depends on its policy, which is stored in the strengths of the connection, between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly's evasive actions.
The other piece of good news, for a scientist at least, is that much remains to be discovered.
And I'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound, and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once, and I'm like, "Uh oh, this is bad news."
It's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails, and so something either works or you die.
Now the people in the front row are very nervous.
TB: Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here, give me a lay of the land.
TB: Many people after a kidney transplant will develop a little fluid collection around the kidney.
So let's start with care anywhere.
The longer I stayed in the hospital, the sicker I became, and the more expensive it became, and this happens to millions of people around the world every year.
Uncoordinated care today is expensive at best, and it is deadly at worst.
Now this is the most frightening thing to me.
That's the only way that the model works.
And at the end of all of that, they said, "Yes, those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans all of those years ago were wrong, and we have a better path forward."
I only had one night in the hospital.
I define that as an association between biology and another discipline, where each discipline reciprocally advances the other, but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field.
And I'm really pleased to report to you today that the first synthetic self-cleaning, dry adhesive has been made.
Lynn Verinsky: Because of liability insurance.
Well I'm really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot, Stickybot, using a new hierarchical dry adhesive.
The engineers told us, for the climbing robots, that, if they don't have a tail, they fall off the wall.
And perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance.
And watch it now slip, and see what it does with its tail.
And this is what we discovered.
Okay, now we wondered, if we were right, we should be able to test this in a physical model, in a robot.
We'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk, just outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does.
It can actually swim through the air.
Definitely moving towards the landing target.
Look at the end to see the animal.
And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it.
One of the problems is coming up with the right target.
You know, from an oceanic perspective, 450 is way too high.
But the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino.
So here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question.
We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed to recover sediments that tell us stories of climate change, right.
This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish.
Because it's partly floating, you can imagine, is sea level rises a little bit, the ice lifts off the bed, and then it can break off and float north.
You know, we saw this in the core samples as they came up.
And you know what?
And it's covered with algae. That's what happens.
So they're either just truly monster El Ninos, or they're just very strong El Ninos that occurred against a backdrop of global warming.
We're not killing the colony; we're taking a small core sample out of the top.
If you go on the ground there, it looks like this, and this is the grandaddy coral.
We can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral, and there's a whole bunch of things we can do.
But we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records of temperature change that go back hundreds of years, and we put them together.
You can see there's some signals there.
It has many consequences.
So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean.
So, Charlie Veron came up with this statement last year: "The prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic CO2 release."
You're thinking, the poor girl up there -- she thinks she's at a beauty pageant.
This is Donna.
But I'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane, and just requires a movie camera, a projector and a screen.
There was a center there where they were teaching people how to read and write and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage.
And as I sat there, I got very depressed.
I've got to go see what this is all about.
But I have plans for my children.
And they were equally if not more horrifying -- the images were.
We had no funding for it.
In the United States, I was blown away by the motivations, the positive motivations of the American people when they'd see this film.
And these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts that we are faced with today.
May God forgive you.
Perhaps. We have to turn it into a moral war.
But after thinking logically about it, I didn't find any reason why not to meet them and let them know of our suffering.
It's about those children who took to the streets, fighting, screaming, "Free Nelson Mandela!"
And that's an amazing thing.
Watching a film which maybe highlights a character that is fighting to live, or just a character that defies stereotypes, makes a joke, sings a song.
So we've already made a partnership actually, set up through somebody from the TED community, John Camen, introduced me to Steven Apkon, from the Jacob Burns Film Center.
And if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching, then I think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better.
In the year 1919, a virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza suggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea.
Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s that works well, describes the motion of planets, the motion of the moon and so forth, the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees, hitting people on the head.
And this gained Einstein prominence around the world.
There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve.
Now, but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded, two questions immediately arise from his observation.
But if we zoom in and take the perspective of, say, a little ant walking around -- little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions -- the long dimension, but also this clockwise, counter-clockwise direction.
But what about the second question that I asked: does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world?
The idea is like this.
This something else is this dancing filament of energy.
So matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings.
Why are those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form, when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers -- if I had 20 dials up here and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers, almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear.
When you swing your hand, you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again, but they're so small that we wouldn't know it.
Now, the second issue that I want to finish up with is: how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly?
Let me show you that idea visually.
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime.
So, by a show of hands -- we'll start with the easiest one -- Show of hands: how many people think it's the gray one?
So, this is pretty amazing, actually, isn't it?
And if you haven't seen it yet, you're dead. Right?
So how on Earth do we even see?
"You are not reading this."
So, if I could have the lights down up here.
Now, when I tell you, I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes.
It's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past.
Why? Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow, and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow, it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics.
I'm not going to change those tiles at all, but I'm going to reveal the rest of the scene and see what happens to your perception.
Move your eyes around, blink, maybe close one eye.
We pull them out, put them in the fridge, and they fall asleep.
But what are these bees doing in the upper right corner?
We can't. Instead, the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past.
And then we just simply translate that into sound.
So, a six-year-old child. Okay?
So, if we have the lights down.
Let's pull the covers off.
We have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it.
We're standing today in the Central Bank, and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to be speaking about.
And he said that, in fact — Let me see if this thing works.
I don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets to an international audience, but I have to.
There was massive protest. A lot of us in this room took part in the protest in different forms.
But what were they accused of?
I'm going to pause here and bring in something I saw in November last year at Wall Street. I was at Zuccotti Park.
What if -- But to make it in these wrongs, you have to read a lot of spy novels and follow some of that stuff, right?
And without getting into all of the details, it is said to have collapsed — I'm using my words very carefully — it's said to have collapsed in January of '09, which is just coming up to nearly four years.
It's a not-for-profit blog that I run.
The Central Bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
So they hit my question with a question.
I wouldn't dignify it. I'm on a point.
And public officials are supposed to file to say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities.
I'm going to continue the work to press on, to get some resolution of those matters at the Ministry of Finance.
We need to increase the consciousness.
And they're different.
A lot of times, these trade-offs are about more than just security, and I think that's really important.
So you'd think that us, as a successful species on the planet -- you, me, everybody -- would be really good at making these trade-offs.
2010 New York, not so much.
And the fourth is people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don't control.
I tell people, if it's in the news, don't worry about it.
One in a million, one in a billion -- they're both almost never.
So back to economics.
Security theater's exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly.
But in a modern and complex world, you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face.
A couple years ago, I was in South Africa on safari.
Models can come from industry.
I mean, there were people who were afraid to push doorbells, because there was electricity in there, and that was dangerous.
So a nice example of this came from last year and swine flu.
And when the vaccine appeared last winter, there were a lot of people -- a surprising number -- who refused to get it -- as a nice example of how people's feelings of security change, how their model changes, sort of wildly with no new information, with no new input.
This is not uncommon.
Models are hard to dislodge.
And we rely on others. We rely on proxies.
Now when these go out of whack, you have two options.
We live in a technological world; reality changes all the time.
There wasn't any real risk, but people were scared.
It turns out when a baby's born now, they put an RFID bracelet on the baby, put a corresponding one on the mother, so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward, an alarm goes off.
Thank you.
They're under threat because of changing climate.
All the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds.
You label them. You do some high-tech things here and there, some low-tech things here and there.
And that is very useful information.
These seeds are used for restoration.
The future research is "How can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds, without having to plant them every 10 years?"
So what happened when the professor left the room?
That child already, at four, understood the most important principle for success, which is the ability to delay gratification.
A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow, they were in trouble.
Hispanic kids, two out of three ate the marshmallow; one out of three did not.
Thank you so much.
And then it was abandoned.
At the time, there was a lot of opposition.
So we said over a 20-year time period, the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about 250 million.
This is one of my favorite features in section one.
The High Line used to be covered in billboards, and so we've taken a playful take where, instead of framing advertisements, it's going to frame people in views of the city.
Thanks.
Let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today.
You cannot talk to everybody all the time.
When I first came to Afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister, I met the commander of ISAF, the international troops.
It was very controversial to say three, four, five years ago.
But if you don't talk, you can't engage the other side.
That's not the point.
I think that is wrong.
Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion.
It's their right to fight."
We are seeing some new signs.
It's crucial to understand, I believe, because of technology and because of globalization, societies from bottom-up.
We need to improve the necessary skills, and we need the courage to use them.
What is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?"
At this point, she stops me, and she says, "Who are you?
But I'm not thinking "monsteret" is a good thing.
Basically, these people committed ecological suicide in order to make more of these.
And she has studied the statues for 20-some years, and she has detailed records of every single statue.
The red line is what is done in most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle.
A metamaterial is an artificial material, which manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation, in a way that you couldn't otherwise.
We do a lot of work in biomedical fields.
And I'm trying to use a very scientific approach.
So, I'm either really good at faking it, or this particular model seems to work.
My kids saw the movie, and afterwards they came to me and they said, "So, Dad, so -- so -- that character -- that's Jill, right?"
I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs.
You hike around, you see something like this.
But, besides being intellectually and scientifically interesting, it's also very different than the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.
And the last day, the sun comes out, the Orcas come, they're right by the boat. It's fantastic.
I think Paul Simon is in the audience, and he has -- he may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex, "Slip-Slidin' Away."
And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors or metamaterials or whale sex, the common -- or lowest common denominator -- is me.
So let me start with genomics.
I can make them healthy."
But most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen, because, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people -- they have the same genome.
And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct.
Basically, a human body is a conversation going on, both within the cells and between the cells, and they're telling each other to grow and to die, and when you're sick, something's gone wrong with that conversation.
I kept getting this call from this oncologist named David Agus.
And he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it.
They really tell us what's going on there.
So seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be Galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time, and suddenly you say, "Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was."
So this already, I think, is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine.
So if we put you in the category of you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin.
Well, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body -- you know, where did it appear? -- and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body.
So your house is dealing with leaks all the time, but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on.
So I think eventually, once we have one of these models for people, which we'll get eventually -- I mean, our group won't get all the way there -- but eventually we'll have a very good computer model -- sort of like a global climate model for weather.
And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future.
It was February 3rd, 2008.
But when we talked to people, it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States.
And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do, which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe, and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe, and make introductions.
Now here is the net out of this.
Stage One is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes, and then pool together with people who think like they do.
I've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class.
Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."
The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said, "Well while you were, you know, doing your research," -- notice the condescending tone -- "While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution."
This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.
But you'll notice the level of excitement.
There is, in fact, another stage.
Largely because people like Desmond Tutu set up a Stage Five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.
I mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great, oriented only by our values, no other guidance.
So the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society.
He went from being alive and passionate at Stage One -- remember, "Life sucks, despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" -- to walking into a Boys and Girls Club, folding his arms, sitting down in a chair, and saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.
Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach, extend your influence, but instead, find someone you don't know, and find someone else you don't know, and introduce them.
If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll, people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.
So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.
Thank you very much.
We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward.
The click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life, announcing our entry into every lightless room.
So buried in signage are these structures, that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor: the small commercial building from an earlier century, whose upper floors have been sealed, and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer.
Every child recapitulates this ascension, straddling one or both legs, sitting sideways, or leaning against the body.
They understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap, as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels.
Where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach-proof bins.
We're here to celebrate compassion.
Now the word "tolerance," if you look at it in the dictionary, connotes "allowing," "indulging" and "enduring."
What are its kindred and component parts?
Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion.
But he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body, in all its frailty and its grace, without, at the same time, becoming more compassionate towards all of life.
He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution, but a sign.
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale.
We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in Europe or the Scottsboro boys in the American South.
So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it's not.
So was Mother Teresa.
Now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this, and we need them to mine it for us now.
I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns.
And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends.
It's different from being shy.
We sat in rows of desks like this, and we did most of our work pretty autonomously.
Now in fact, some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts.
And some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum, and we call these people ambiverts.
Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in Hewlett-Packard where he was working at the time.
And groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room, even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas -- I mean zero.
But in America's early days, we lived in what historians call a culture of character, where we still, at that point, valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude.
I have a suitcase full of books.
He would takes the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought.
But now all of a sudden my job is very different, and my job is to be out here talking about it, talking about introversion.
Just stop it.
Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness.
So I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly.
Then, about the initiative that Chris mentioned, that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50x15.
My father found that in a junkyard, and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow -- to this day, I frankly don't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world -- but, by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old, and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever, and how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites, was a real exposure to me to classical music.
What we believe is that the Internet, frankly, is a connection of people and ideas.
And I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think the results so far have been remarkable, and I can only anticipate and get real excited about what I think is going to happen in the next eight years, while we get to the 2015 initiative.
It is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost, to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach.
And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning we said it very clearly: this is not a charity.
And it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach.
They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa.
We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the West Cape in South Africa, in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School, and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers, it's just phenomenal.
Because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours, and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it.
That's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge that he was placing on me, because he was a great father.
And I think it's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease.
And I think you matter.
I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke that I really appreciate what he does, because it makes my life work a whole lot easier.
Good for you.
Everybody's betting their life on something.
So, what is it for?
Do you think we have a stewardship here, to take the environment seriously?"
So all of this money started pouring in, and all of this fame started pouring in, and I go, what do I do with this?
In fact, personally, I've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money.
The last thing we did is we became what I call "reverse tithers."
I meet people all the time who have those, and they're not necessarily happy.
It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning, we find significance.
When you read this prayer, it sounds incredibly selfish, self-centered.
And then he says, "So that the king" -- he was the king of Israel at that time at its apex in power -- "so that the king may care for the widow and orphan, support depressed, defend the defenseless, care for the sick, assist the poor, speak up for the foreigner, those in prison."
I have a church full of CEOs and scientists.
It's not just, "Wow, isn't that cool?"
Now, what was in Moses' hand?
And the third thing: it's a symbol of his influence.
Last year, I was invited to speak at NBA All-Stars game.
And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today, to all of you very bright people at TED, is to say, "What's in your hand?"
Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it?
Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited when you're doing, quote, "spiritual things," like going to church or helping the poor, or, you know, confessing or doing something like that.
: We're traveling today with the Minister of Defense of Colombia, head of the army and the head of the police, and we're dropping off 650 laptops today to children who have no television, no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past 40 years.
It's not going to happen, you know, in one year, but it's an important, deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children.
So now, in closing, people say, now why laptops?
And by being a zero-dollar laptop, we can go to countries that can't afford it at all.
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota, I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles.
This might strike you as a strange career move, but it actually has one great advantage: no job competition.
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals, in our personal and professional lives, and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.
You guys are answering the question: How does it feel to realize you're wrong?
That's when he falls.
Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.
And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself, and she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?"
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality.
But to me, what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human.
Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up, it's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system, something we can eradicate or overcome.
But a couple of months later, I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq, find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction, liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.
No offense, but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong.
You put together machines and water, and you get landscapes that look like this. And then you get sales that look like this. It's brute force. So what you've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that's a reasonably natural system. You start taming that natural system. You put a lot of force behind that natural system. You put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides -- -- behind that natural system, and you end up with systems that look like this.
This would be a good outcome for energy. And of course, by now, you're probably saying to yourself, "Self, I thought I came to a talk about energy and here's this guy talking about biology."
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But as you think of coal, this is what burned wheat kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal.
And as you think of biomaterials, this guy -- who did part of the sequencing of the human genome, who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world -- has been thinking about how you structure this. And there's a series of smart people thinking about this. And they've been putting together companies like Synthetic Genomics, like, a Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are trying to do is to think of, how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force?
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons. That means 86 percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a role in here for conservation. There's a role in here for alternative stuff, but we've also got to get that other portion right.
Because what we actually count truly counts.
As I spent time with Vivian, I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre in how she did her work.
But also back then, remember we stopped eating French fries in this country.
And we started asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually addressing the higher needs, these transformational needs for our key employees in the company.
As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time, what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure.
I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries, a place some folks call Shangri-La.
Most world leaders didn't take notice, and those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics."
We create the conditions for happiness to occur.
How many know him? Anybody?
Good question. But back to Bhutan.
I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote, and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.
Abe Maslow said long ago something you've heard before, but you didn't realize it was him.
Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that doesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life, but actually counts what we most value, the things that are intangible.
He tells me that he can always count on Vivian and the staff there to make him feel at home.
What one thing can you start counting today that actually would be meaningful in your life, whether it's your work life or your business life?
BL: What are you reading? There are no words there.
But we're talking about perception here, right?
Right? If you go down below on a boat, your inner ears are you telling you you're moving. Your eyes, because it's moving in register with the boat, say I'm standing still.
Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you that actually it's a way of being.
So Amy, would you please come up?
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color, but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern.
Dave Strudwick: So you keep track of each.Student: Henry, can you help me here?
Now, I tell them, a paper has four different sections: an introduction, a methods, a results, a discussion.
All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old.
And there, it was reviewed by five independent referees, and it was published. Okay?
"I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now.
And you like technology, right?
You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came in the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project.
This is a terrible thing, that the oil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf."
The reason why you want to work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke is so you can have choices, economic choices.
Often, we think we're doing a good thing.
And so we kind of have this kind of moral feel-good moment.
Recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic, the burning of the plastic, which releases incredible toxic chemicals and, once again, kills people.
It's just the poor people get hit first and worst.
We don't have disposable species.
I don't mean looking at it from that way -- abusing the little species.
I don't know what those other states were doing."
And yet, as a movement that has to broaden its constituency, that has to grow, that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone, one of the challenges to the success of this movement, of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift, is people look at our movement with some suspicion.
And really, they fundamentally told you, "Are you going to hug a tree, or are you going to hug a child? Pick.
It was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through.
And they've actually issued a pilot's license -- a powerlift pilot's license -- for this type of aircraft.
It's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity, as a series of parts -- a large number of parts -- flying in formation.
I'm sure any of you have asked the question, yeah, are there great things up there -- what am I going to do, get up there?
Unbeknownst to many of you, the highway in the sky that I'm talking about here has been under construction for 10 years.
After all, if you can fly like that, why are you going to drive around on a highway?
Actually the critical point was in 1989, when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle -- how completely stable it was in all circumstances, which is of course very critical.
If that single-stability system, that brain that flies that aircraft, fails, or if the engine fails, that vehicle crashes. There is no option to that.
And that sportscar won Sports Car of the Year.
The computers back up each other. There's a voting system -- if one computer is not agreeing with the other three, it's kicked out of the system.
And it's going to change the demographics in a very significant way.
Forty-seven percent -- yes, as soon as they could -- price could come down.
So I thought I'd better look it up first.
So when you talk about expensive power, the cost per kilowatt-hour to supply battery power to something is on the order of two to three hundred pounds.
The light bulb was a fairly simple task, from their standpoint.
And if you can cause that coil to resonate, what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies -- at a fairly high frequency, by the way.
And actually, the magnetic fields we're using are basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field.
And then finally, electric vehicles.
That coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier that creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field.
It creates a magnetic field here.
It also has coiled electronics that WiTricity has put into the back of it.
So, imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling.
So some of you may know about the chemical Bisphenol A, BPA.
Second, we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution.
Green or natural burials, which don't use embalming, are a step in the right direction, but they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies.
It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife.
The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture I'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation -- the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies.
And believe it or not, a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms.
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar."
He spoke six languages, he played 15 musical instruments, he was a licensed pilot, he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator, he was an expert in swine nutrition, dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir, and we did travel the country, and the world, and we did have a lot of kids.
He coached Little League for our son.
We take the kids to Italy.
So what do I say when he says, "What do you want me to do?"
We fought together, we lived together.
I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did, why he did what he did, why everyone around us did what they did.
Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands, we just kept redefining hope.
Days before he died.
And during Terence's illness, I, we, we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too.
So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye, and maybe our new story will be about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.
And suddenly he knows he's been defeated.
Hope isn't a bug.
When you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web, remembering URLs, saving favorites.
Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth, global perspective, local knowledge.
You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints, vantage points, angles, textures. We bring all that data back in.
They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.
A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller.
Some years ago, I set out to try to understand if there was a possibility to develop biofuels on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels but not compete with agriculture for water, fertilizer or land.
Well, the reason we're doing this offshore is because if you look at our coastal cities, there isn't a choice, because we're going to use waste water, as I suggested, and if you look at where most of the waste water treatment plants are, they're embedded in the cities.
They of course use solar energy to grow, and the wave energy on the surface provides energy for mixing the algae, and the temperature is controlled by the surrounding water temperature.
And finally, because it's an offshore structure, we can think in terms of how it might contribute to an aquaculture activity offshore.
So let me show you how the system works.
So we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact of this system in the marine environment, and I mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site in Moss Landing Marine Lab.
Here's an image of what we could do in San Francisco Bay.
I set out to find a pathway to innovative production of sustainable biofuels, and en route I discovered that what's really required for sustainability is integration more than innovation.
So that's interesting. You're not patenting it.
The first question there is why China has grown so much faster than India.
Whereas in India, you cannot do that, because you have to listen to the public.
Here's the key question.
if you believe in the infrastructure view, then you will say, "Country 1 must be China.
Since 1989, the country has performed at a double-digit rate every year for the last 20 years.
And which one is a democracy?"
One reason is the East Asian Model.
Burma didn't succeed.
The whole country went mad.
The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy is much more substantial than the data here indicated.
This is an extremely strange fact.
Financial Times printed this picture of an Indian textile factory with the title, "India Poised to Overtake China in Textile."
Statically, China is a one-party system, authoritarian -- there's no question about it.
But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth.
It has the improving fundamentals.
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford.
You would be sharper and more alert.
And what I've done is I've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse; I've looked at media environments, like the world wide web, that have been extraordinarily innovative; I've gone back to the history of the first cities; I've even gone to biological environments, like coral reefs and rainforests, that involve unusual levels of biological innovation; and what I've been looking for is shared patterns, kind of signature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments.
It's a new configuration that has never formed before.
And so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries, and then it ends up being useless.
It's got a fan, it's got headlights for warmth, it's got door chimes for alarm -- it runs off a car battery.
And he recorded all of these conversations and tried to figure out where the most important ideas, where they happened.
We've heard a lot recently about hunch and instinct and blink-like sudden moments of clarity, but in fact, a lot of great ideas linger on, sometimes for decades, in the back of people's minds.
And what Gruber found was that Darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epiphany, reading Malthus in October of 1838.
And the other thing is to allow those hunches to connect with other people's hunches; that's what often happens.
And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach.
So they made it really easy to find it.
And they said, "Jeez, you know, we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it's farthest away.
So they went back, and they thought about it.
This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K., but it's a global phenomenon.
Let me give you another number to put that in perspective, and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005 by Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.
Think about what happened, after all, to the poor frog.
Think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance, or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the Great Depression, or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies, including those whose motto might be "don't do evil," to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class.
As a result, if you are very, very smart and very, very lucky, you can get very, very rich very, very quickly.
There are superstar cooks and superstar farmers.
So what's not to like?
Once you have the tremendous economic power that we're seeing at the very, very top of the income distribution and the political power that inevitably entails, it becomes tempting as well to start trying to change the rules of the game in your own favor.
That's shown in what I consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time.
But it's important to remember that before we learned how to share the fruits of the Industrial Revolution with the broad swathes of society, we had to go through two depressions, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Long Depression of the 1870s, two world wars, communist revolutions in Russia and in China, and an era of tremendous social and political upheaval in the West.
Look, I had second thoughts, really, about whether I could talk about this to such a vital and alive audience as you guys.
Now, as you heard in the intro, I work in intensive care, and I think I've kind of lived through the heyday of intensive care. It's been a ride, man.
So what's happening now is there's been a big shift in the way that people die, and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable to what we can do as what it used to be like when I was doing this in the '80s and '90s.
Which is a familiar phrase to us.
So a group of us started doing survey work, and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in Newcastle, in the Newcastle area, and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating.
What we know is that obviously we are all going to die, but how we die is actually really important, obviously not just to us, but also to how that features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards.
Sorry, I just feel such a, I feel such a Cassandra here.
She looks terrified.
But then, when the funding ran out, we went back to look six months later, and everybody had stopped again, and nobody was having these conversations anymore.
One of them is, you can, just ask this simple question. This question never fails.
So that one didn't really run, but I was very struck by this.
So I'm an opponent of euthanasia, but I do think we have to give people back some control.
My story starts way before I was born.
My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto, and at 44 she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother, but I carry on her name -- her exact name, Eva Vertes -- and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too.
And so I thought, "Maybe if it can promote cell growth, it can inhibit cell death, too."
And while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature, trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field.
But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response, but can't quite control it.
And while I was reading all these articles about cancer, it seemed that the articles -- a lot of them -- focused on, you know, the genetics of breast cancer, and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer -- tracking the cancer through the body, tracing where it is, where it goes.
So these articles were saying, you know, "Skeletal -- metastasis to skeletal muscle -- is very rare."
So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life.
We use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body -- our heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles.
So, there's so much interplay here.
In 1978, I was working for Time magazine, and I was given a three-day assignment to photograph Amerasian children, children who had been fathered by American GIs all over Southeast Asia, and then abandoned -- 40,000 children all over Asia.
And of course, I was immediately intrigued.
So there I was, I couldn't speak a word of Korean, and this is the first night I met Hyun-Sook.
And almost universally, amongst all the kids, they were really psychologically damaged by having been made fun of, ridiculed, picked on and been rejected.
Again, not at all shy or withdrawn, or anything like the other children that I'd photographed.
They would actually cover the windows every night, so that light couldn't be seen, because the South Korean government has said for years that the North Koreans may invade at any time.
And the translator said, "The grandmother says that she thinks she's dying, and she wants to know if you would take Hyun-Sook to America with you."
And I said, "If you're serious, I will try to find a family for her."
And Myung Sung, under some pressure from me and the translator, gave us an address on the outside of Seoul.
And she said, "He says he knows who you are, what do you want?"
And the more I tried talking to him, the less friendly he was getting.
And I said to them, "Look, there's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to America."
And she said, "Well, he's saying, 'Who the hell are you to walk into my house, some rich American with your cameras around your neck, accusing me of enslaving my niece?
And they actually take items of clothing and photographs, and they burn them as part of the ritual.
He had kids from all over Korea living there, and he would find families for these kids.
And there's clothes, and there's kids, and, you know, there's three adults and 75 kids -- you can imagine.
The uncle went back to his family, and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I went out to dinner.
And I said, "Yeah, I have one too."
So, sure enough, it's one o'clock, room's freezing, I go to close the window, and I hear people shouting outside, and I thought, "Oh, the bars must have just gotten out."
So, we try to get to the door, and we run to the door, and we open the door and it's like walking into a blast furnace.
Please, I just want to wake up, it's got to be a nightmare."
He says, "We've got to stop the smoke."
I didn't know who it was, I didn't know what they wanted, and Natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out.
This guy's 60 years old.
So you know, if you were writing this, you'd say, "No, we've got to write the script differently."
This is her cooking teacher.
They were studying Korean; they bought Korean clothes.
This is her first trip back to Korea, so there's her uncle.
Natasha's actually never heard me tell the story.
The first one was actually a funeral -- to be more precise, a reburial.
In fact, I'm borrowing here from one of those very popular books of the time.
And as we already heard, there is a way in which we are trying, and now able, to answer that question.
We do that in our solar system.
The Copernican dream was unfulfilled.
So today, I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope, Kepler, has been able to tell us in the last few weeks, and, lo and behold, we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus.
So the question is: what do we do next?
We know and expect that we'll see that.
We need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that.
And they really help molecules, like nucleic acids, like RNA and DNA, stay inside, develop, change, divide and do some of the processes that we call life.
Well, there are many reasons, and you heard some of them in the short talk today.
What if that Copernican insignificance was actually all wrong?
We can't imagine it.
So what does this tell us?

And they were probably the most infected country in the world.
Look, India got many infected, but had a low level.
They started low, they skyrocketed, they peaked up there in 2003, and now they are down.
It is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it.
Well if you look at the macro level, it seems more money, more HIV.
Here it goes.
Look, you have bubbles all over the world here.
It could be some virus types.
Vodka, Midsummer's Eve -- new partner for the fall.
Thank you very much.
And we know that most of it is currently owned by people we might call Westerners: Europeans, North Americans, Australasians.
In fact, in 1500, the average Chinese was richer than the average North American.
That's a great question.
And we decided we'd take Koreans in roughly the same geographical place with, notice, the same basic traditional culture, and we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism.
Smith -- and I want you to go and bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile; it's a wonderful statue -- Smith, in the "Wealth of Nations" published in 1776 -- that's the most important thing that happened that year ...
I want to explain to you that there were six killer apps that set the West apart from the rest.
Five, the consumer society.
Think of what that means.
That's the land grant on the bottom half of the slide.
It doesn't rise any faster after these countries become independent.
The gap between Shanghai and the United Kingdom and the United States is as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S.
This is the Great Reconvergence, and it's the biggest story of your lifetime.
Warning: that may not work.
That is civilization -- and in its soil grow continually freedom, comfort and culture," what all TEDsters care about most.
But one thing is for sure, the Great Divergence is over, folks.
So my story really is as much about that convergence in the Americas as it's a convergence story in Eurasia.
The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon, which has just accelerated this huge shift, which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy.
Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider grappling with a beetle.
To answer that, you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider.
These can be grouped into seven categories.
Spider silk is almost entirely protein.
Silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences.
So what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors.
We call that the tool kit of a spider.
These are the two species of spiders for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spider silk research has been to replicate their dragline silk proteins.
And what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them.
But you get these resources together.
And what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself, charming though it is, but rather to these photos.
So, I was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged "Mermaid Parade." There were 3,100 photos taken by 118 photographers, all aggregated and then put under this nice, neat name, shown in reverse chronological order.
No good just hiring employees, you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth.
You have to exclude some people.
Right. You'll have experienced this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone, and you stopped making plans.
It's taken over a wider geographic area.
And by the time you get to the middle, you've got hundreds of people who have contributed only one photo each.
The costs of running the institution mean that you cannot take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame.
Right? So the question is, do you want that photo? Yes or no.
Most of the cooperative systems we've seen haven't been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase.
We've looked at who's contributed to Linux, and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing." Right?
Because this kind of value is unreachable in classic institutional frameworks, but is part of cooperative systems of open-source software, of file sharing, of the Wikipedia. I've used a lot of examples from Flickr, but there are actually stories about this from all over.
This is so much more important than Xbox, but it's a lot less glitzy.
Web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization.
And if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism, it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class.
Now, this is the part of the talk where I tell you what's going to come as a result of all of this, but I'm running out of time, which is good, because I don't know.
But the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment.
The challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is, you know, how do you make it taste good?
I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules.
They become accessible to the yeast as food.
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is "mise en place," which is just a French way of saying, "get organized."
The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars, creating carbon dioxide and alcohol -- essentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is.
This takes a second, but it's a distinctive stage.
And stage 11, we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away.
And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor.
Now, wheat is alive, and as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds.
O.K.? Radical, not subtle.
And we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call "leaven."
In other words, personality and character's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker.
Students love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game.
This is the product that everyone in the world eats, that is so difficult to give up.
May your crust be crisp, and your bread always rise.
No, no, I didn't write that.
I had to practice it as a kid, and I'm really sick of it. So -- I would, so what I might like to try to do is to change it, to transform it in some ways, to personalize it, so I might take the opening, like this idea -- and then I might substitute -- and then I might improvise on that melody that goes forward from there -- So that might be the kind of thing -- Why thank you.
I can actually do all sorts of things. I can play with a violin bow. I don't have to use the chopsticks.
Anyway, so this is also a really enjoyable role.
This is an excerpt from a score called "The Metaphysics of Notation."
I mean, there's not any traditional notation.
And once again, this is, for me, interesting.
Okay? But then there was this other stuff, right?
The important question is, "Is it interesting?"
One thing that this baby could be thinking about, that could be going on in his mind, is trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other baby.
Now all of the babies, even in Berkley, like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.
And then she would simply put her hand out and say, "Can you give me some?"
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that's actually demonstrated it.
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this?
So they're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas, and we're production and marketing.
They go out and test it against the evidence.
Because after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics, they look extremely stupid.
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence.
So in these circumstances, the children are using statistics to find out about the world, but after all, scientists also do experiments, and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.
Boy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing.
He told the experimenter to do this, to try putting it out onto the other location.
If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something, what they really do is do a series of experiments.
So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that's important.
It's good to be a grownup.
And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game.
Now, the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity.
It's not something you get in computer games at the moment, at all.
And for that, we use the neural network, which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans.
And you repeat that process over and over again, until you have something that walks -- in this case, in a straight line, like this.
So, this is the one that can't walk at all.
What you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visualization of that body.
It's going to stick out its hands.
Now, this becomes really exciting when you push that character in different directions, again, just as I've done.
And now from the left -- and it falls differently.
And that's a really fascinating thing about this approach.
Only, I think it's quite a big blow again.
This is something I just got last night from an animation studio in London, who are using our software and experimenting with it right now.
I'm not quite sure why, but we've done it anyway.
There's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before.
The degree of interactivity you're going to get is totally different, I think, from what you're getting right now.
The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body.
So, this was not something we actually put in there.
Incredible. That was really incredible.
You can tickle the rug.
You don't like it?
I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani.
Even my books on children have cute, fuzzy animals.
Hello voicemail, my old friend.
Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me.
If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration.
Over the years it's gotten easier to use.
Which they do.
Another one, a guy called -- this is absolutely true! -- his computer had crashed, and he told the technician he couldn't restart it no matter how many times he typed 11.
And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades.
Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface, is knowing when to use which one of these features.
And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall.
There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village.
And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not "Print."
You do not.
I'm gettin' royalties from everyone.
You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code.
So is there any hope? The screens are getting smaller.
They had voice recorders and FM transmitters.
Either one, you're going to lose. What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts.
Like, I get hundreds of them a day. Period.
No new features. It's never happened before in software!
And best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells.
If you think about it, in history, a long, long time ago we dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual.
You can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the Internet if you want to, and clearly someone recently -- I saw in a science magazine -- they said, well, the 1918 flu is too dangerous to FedEx around.
The bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power.
So after giving up on the book -- and I had the great honor to be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago, and to work through venture capital on the innovative side, and to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw as some of these big problems.
I think the challenge for us is -- I'm very certain that that will happen, the challenge is, will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device?
We'll hear a lot more about that from Al Gore very shortly.
Their strength: they're almost the strongest material, tensile strength material known.
They conduct heat along their length but not across -- well, there is no width, but not in the other direction if you stack them up; that's a property of carbon fiber also.
New ways of making electric transportation.
We have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling that still works, roughly. That's Tamiflu.
Cocktails, more polyvalent vaccines.
Today scientists, technologists, businessmen, engineers don't have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions.
And growing up as we have, and holding very high the value of free speech, this is a hard thing for us to accept -- for all of us to accept.
Apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there, we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets.
Because in the mid-1950s, when I was a tiny child, they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik, which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin.
And when it became a landscape, it also became a destination, and altered, really, the course of my life.
Well, sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other, even on this planet.
So, what about life on Mars?
There's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place – one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed, and there are these amazing structures called blueberries, which are these little, rocky concretions that we are busy making biologically in my lab right now.
Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium? We don't know.
It's a very simple trick, and I never fail to do it when I'm sitting in a window seat.
This is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet, anywhere.
In fact, there's so much energy available for biology in this cave, that there's actually a huge number of cavefish.
And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use, then, to run their life processes.
And these organisms, because they're very separate from the surface, make a vast array of novel compounds.
You know, it's not easy to get into these caves.
These are hopping microbot swarms.
Did it start there and get transported here?
Don't you feel one step closer already, like it's already becoming part of your identity?
1926, Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology, called this "substitution."
You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgement brings, and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing.
Now Codex C was only discovered in 1906, and it landed on my desk in Baltimore on the 19th of January, 1999.
He erased all of their texts, and then he cut the sheets down in the middle, he shuffled them up, and he rotated them 90 degrees, and he wrote prayers on top of these books.
This book is the definition of a write-off.
And it was an expensive job, but actually it wouldn't be as much as you think because these people, they didn't come from money, they came from Archimedes.
So, tiny fragments we actually managed to put back in the right place.
And in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing.
And there we are, I can give them to you.
And what we wanted to get was the iron.
This is called synchrotron radiation, and it's normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing.
And now we think we know.
So Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon.
They cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory, and no one knows what they did with his body.
And that is the future of the Web.
Because what's really in it for the institution is this: Now why do people go to the Louvre?
On the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record.
It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy.
A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing.
I was really happy when I was done.
These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles, this haunting, wonderful, nutty, mushroomy smell wafted up.
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.
It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.
This is a coffee made from a very unusual process.
It's almost like a home medical center -- and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in.
I mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet.
This was a fun one.
This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology.
What there is of it left you don't know if it's real -- it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world.
And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47.
And in particular, I think we can learn things about learning.
And this virtual object takes 200 real people about 56 days of real time to build, plus countless thousands of hours of effort before that.
This is a bit like ambition and drive -- I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard.
But this isn't the really interesting stuff.
Let's say, for the sake of argument, my mission is to get 15 pies and I can get 15 pies by killing these cute, little monsters.
Let's think about probability.
There's 100 percent up here.
So I'm drawn on. It's not too easy, not too difficult.
It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally in little bits and pieces, you give them one profile character avatar which is constantly progressing in tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own.
It all feeds in as minute reinforcement.
And if you think about using this in testing, in just introducing control elements of randomness in all forms of testing and training, you can transform the levels of people's engagement by tapping into this very powerful evolutionary mechanism.
And the second thing is confidence, that we can see how game-playing and reward structures make people braver, make them more willing to take risks, more willing to take on difficulty, harder to discourage.
That's a problem because they dropped two or three decent items.
Let's start with business.
Government, well, one thing that comes to mind is the U.S. government, among others, is literally starting to pay people to lose weight.
I started out obsessed with global security policy because I lived in New York during 9/11, and it was obviously a very relevant thing.
I think about eating a lot, and I really love it.
The numbers are pretty crazy.
Unfortunately, in our agricultural system, we haven't done a good job in the last three decades of exporting those technologies around the world.
I think it's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides.
And in one generation, they're going from hunger, and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger, to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation.
You know, I think if we really think that this is something that's happened in the last 30 years, there's hope in that.
And the 30 Project is really focused on these long-term ideas for food system change.
Well, if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple, then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn, soy and wheat.
And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession.
But I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process, into three very pedantic statements.
I'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control.
At which point, you and your client have the ability to start considering what you're going to put inside that vessel, the agency, the vision.
Why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation?
All they needed was labor.
Now, superfly, the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower, and you smear them across flytower and auditorium.
They had to make a decision, based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture and one-third infrastructure, to actually the inverse, two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture.
You notice that there is no proscenium, the balconies have been raised up, there are no seats, the floor in the auditorium is flat.
And they told us one important thing: "You shall not beta-test."
The proscenium, also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space.
You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber: "Aida," their elephants, you can bring the elephants in.
That allows the company to raise operational budgets without having to compete with other venues with much larger auditoriums.
And last but not least, you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate operational budgets to overcome the building in fact performing to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem.
This is the AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center's Dee and Charles Wyly Theater.
You might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.
Blog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions, all of these things were being expressed by people online, and leaving behind trails.
And the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside.
So the next movement is called mobs.
"I can feel my cancer grow."
And recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.
I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.
Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.
I built a web interface for viewing "The Whale Hunt" that attempts to do just this.
And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.
It's baleen. Moving on.
And then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold.
He was getting started early. Those were his hands.
She was wearing this silver ring that had the word "love" engraved on it, and she'd found it in the road somewhere.
A 24-year-old truck driver.
He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work, and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at.
His wish was to make some money and open a store.
Ah, because you know, it's impermanent.
JH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die when she was around 40. That was enough life for her.
You know, we wake up in the morning, you get dressed, put on your shoes, you head out into the world.
It's almost like they're practicing magic tricks.
The other guy was still working on me, collapsing my other lung, and I managed to, by hitting that guy, to get a minute.
And I came to in the morning.
And later on, when I got out and the flashbacks and the nightmares were giving me a hard time, I went back to him and I was sort of asking him, you know, what am I gonna do?
Thank you. Very lucky to be here. Thank you.
Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic.
The point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing.
And so, texting is very loose in its structure.
And in order to understand it, what we want to see is the way, in this new kind of language, there is new structure coming up.
And yet, there it is, so you assume there's been some kind of hiccup.
We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles.
Slash is used in a very different way in texting among young people today.
You can't do that while you're texting, and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium.
Increasing evidence is that being bilingual is cognitively beneficial.
And — I really would ask that — and then I'd want to know actually what was going on on "Downton Abbey."
But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more than what most people think, and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer, and so I end up writing software to do that.
This will take about 30 seconds or so.
Why were more people killed last month than in any preceding month of this conflict?
In the words of President Obama, "If the Taliban take over again, they will invite back Al-Qaeda, who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can."
From the Taliban's point of view, that was their number one mistake last time.
But in those early days when we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources, we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan.
And Mullah Mustafa -- he's the man with the pen and paper -- explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph, Nadir Shah had bet him that he couldn't hit me.
I ran a center at Harvard from 2008 to 2010, and there were people like Michael Semple there who speak Afghan languages fluently, who've traveled to almost every district in the country.
Or in 2007, the Norwegian deputy foreign minister, Espen Eide, to say that that would deliver the "decisive year."
It's very difficult for a politician, because you're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain.
Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds.
We need to begin from the position that our knowledge, our power, our legitimacy is limited.
The crime rates in Bosnia today are lower than they are in Sweden.
We're not matching our resources to our priorities.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
We imagine there are only two choices: either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation.
Rory, thank you very much.
So, you see two examples here.
What you see here is a prototypic device.
And the combination of those two is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you want.
And then finally, a point that you don't think of so much in developed world medicine: it eliminates sharps.
And the most common of these is in a device that looks like the thing on the left.
That's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper.
Do they have a common cold?
What the guy actually meant was that he'd fed a 30-day dose of Dapsone to his dog, that morning.
And so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there, and at this point there is a dramatic flourish, and out comes the universal solution to everything these days, which is a cell phone. In this particular case, a camera phone.
And the answer is not complicated but it's one which I don't want to go through here, other than to say that the communication systems for doing this are really pretty well understood.
You make it flow under and over.
You dip in a corner. The fluid goes into the center.
And we sat down, we did the physics of eggbeaters and self-aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing, sent it off to a journal.
And the most recent involved a couple of people at MIT, one of them being an exceptionally bright kid who is one of the very few people I would think of who's an authentic genius.
And he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate -- of any race, of any party -- in history.
Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas, but these are very, very profound differences.
We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair?
In Louisiana, about one in five white voters said, "Yes, one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African-American."
Is there something driving this?
So it's the combination of these two things: it's education and the type of neighbors that you have, which we'll talk about more in a moment.
In cites, about 80 percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race, but in rural communities, only about 30 percent.
I have a couple of very obvious, I suppose, ideas for maybe how to do that.
And as a result it's a very tolerant community, which is different, I think, than something like this, which is in Schaumburg, Illinois, where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac and drive-through Starbucks and stuff like that.
A few months ago, a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where I live, and she was brought in confused.
I am not a Luddite.
You might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school here in Edinburgh, and his character, Sherlock Holmes, was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell.
And he says, "And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Row to get here to the infirmary?"
Such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh, except in the botanical gardens.
He began to tap on the chests of his patients, on their abdomens.
And Fildes was so taken by the physician who held vigil at the bedside for two, three nights, that he decided that he would try and depict the physician in our time -- almost a tribute to this physician.
When are they going to come by and explain things to me?
One had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer, had a small breast cancer detected -- had her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived.
Now you and I could argue that they probably did not need to touch her breasts.
I say that because these are difficult patients.
And I remember my very first patient in that series continued to tell me more history during what was meant to be the physical exam visit.
The bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this, but here's what you should do, here's what we should do."
We signal transitions of power with rituals.
And as I wondered what he was up to, his stick fingers made their way up to his pajama shirt, fumbling with his buttons.
And the message, which I didn't fully understand then, even as I delivered it, and which I understand better now is this: I will always, always, always be there.
Well, we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas -- trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas.
So it looks something like this.
People remember the hits; they forget the misses.
Three IQ points per 10 years, going up.
Or is it more likely that a reader of "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop?
You can say a miracle occurs.
And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw.
So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things on a simple level.
And, of course, happy faces.
Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville, just down the street, or is it up the street from here?
And we went down, investigated.
Anybody can do it, turns out.
Now, I'll prime your auditory part of your brain to tell you what you're supposed to hear, and then hear it again.
We are 12 billion light-years from the edge That's a guess No one can ever say it's true But I know that I will always be with you Well, that's nice.
We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group.
Now imagine what you could place in your hands: an apple, maybe your wallet.
If it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally, resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes, to heart disease, to low I.Q.
Inspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this, my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution, something that could work without electricity, that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use, given that the majority of births still take place in the home.
You can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time, after which you simply reheat the pouch.
We tried to understand the root of the problem rather than being biased by what already exists.
And again, I couldn't go. But it's a fascinating group. They make balloon animals.
But we don't think about it that way.
And he went to Reno and he did it again.
And now we're in this new model of leadership, where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system, but by leading.
Ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines.
Because you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition, where you're talking about one thing instead of the other.
It's about leading and connecting people and ideas.
You've got people in white hats making food.
They've got their own flag. They've got the eye patches.
You don't need everyone.
That most movements, most leadership that we're doing is about finding a group that's disconnected but already has a yearning -- not persuading people to want something they don't have yet.
I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward.
It can be something as prosaic as shoes, and something as complicated as overthrowing a government.
And around and around and around it goes.
This is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus.
You don't need permission from people to lead them.
They want to be missed the day they don't show up.
And I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out-of-hand.
I got everything for my homework from those two sources.
And I had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes, and that's just a long, thin pipe of carbon that's an atom thick and one 50 thousandth the diameter of your hair.
Making a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple as making chocolate chip cookies, which I love.
One professor even went through my entire procedure, painstakingly -- I'm not really sure where he got all this time -- and he went through and said why each and every step was like the worst mistake I could ever make.
However, subjecting myself to that interrogation, I answered all of their questions, and I guessed on quite a few but I got them right, and I finally landed the lab space I needed.
Theories can be shared, and you don't have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued.
But I'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face.
It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel.
She is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone.
Now, while 4Shbab and "The 99" may look new and shiny, there is actually a very long tradition of this.
And why does sex make babies, and babies spell erotic disaster in couples?
And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship, I think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs.
And we think it's a given, and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that.
We want to minimize the distance. We want to contract that gap.
And I've gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years with "Mating in Captivity," and I asked people, when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner?
It's when I'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance, where this person that is already so familiar, so known, is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.
What do you seek to express there?
We are the only ones who have an erotic life, which means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination.
They knew how to keep themselves alive.
So I turn myself on when, I turn my desires, I wake up when ...
And then at some point they turn around and they look at you, and if you tell them, "Hey kiddo, the world's a great place. Go for it.
Translate this into adult language.
So what happens, if you want to sustain desire, it's that real dialectic piece.
Responsibility and desire just butt heads.
So the rhythms could be pretty intact too, pretty concise.
We managed, but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made.
The instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification, etc., etc.
This is a little bit later.
And well, that was an opera experience.
The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair-sized.
It looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler.
And a new form of music was born.
And they no longer have to be exactly the same.
They wrote what is now called arena rock, which is medium-speed ballads.
The music that, I would say, is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it.
And does it happen anywhere else?
It's adaptive.
I'm saying the two, the passion, the joy, are not mutually exclusive.
And had such -- it was an eye-opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science.
His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him.
He was a brilliant poet, philosopher, writer, soldier -- with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today.
And they're still with us, and you haven't solved them, and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.
But on the other hand, something is wrong.
How do we change man, so that he doesn't lie and cheat, and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever?
You've seen people take beneficial technological advances, such as the Internet we've heard about tonight, and twist them into something corrupting.
And there's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding.
Even if you have no religious belief, there are times when you wonder that there's something else.
I was a little bit surprised, but that evening that's what we talked about, and it was a stimulating conversation.
Why do we suffer? It's an age-old question that we haven't answered.
Or Clark Gable, or whoever it is.
And it's often difficult for young people to understand that.
But she said, as he came to die, he sat up on the side of the bed one day, and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain.
I knew Dr. von Braun very well.
In one of his plays, Alexander Solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying, who says to those gathered around his bed, "The moment when it's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying."
On November 23, 1654, Pascal had a profound religious experience.
The knowledge of God was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind.
I couldn't prove it.
I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum.
Especially I will not die for you.
I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat.
So I couldn't figure out what to read today.
This is "Break Clustered."
Profits made, prophets ignored.
Human contracted itself blind, malignant.
My spine curves spiral.
Resolutions, smoke.
She always felt a little bit of an outsider, although she's been there almost all her life, a woman of Russian extraction.
It didn't make sense that Gayla's mother should die so young.
It was in the football ground.
She argued and argued, and finally she struck lucky when a researcher came through town studying the history of mines in the area, and she told him her story, and at first, of course, like everyone, he didn't believe her, but he went back to Seattle and he did his own research and he realized that she was right.
This wasn't ignorance.
Companies that have been studied for willful blindness can be asked questions like, "Are there issues at work that people are afraid to raise?"
And the other thing that people often say about whistleblowers is, "Well, there's no point, because you see what happens to them.
And I asked him why he did it, and he said, "Well, it was really my daughter who prompted me to do it.
When I went to Libby, Montana, I visited the asbestosis clinic that Gayla Benefield brought into being, a place where at first some of the people who wanted help and needed medical attention went in the back door because they didn't want to acknowledge that she'd been right.
1998: A single mother of four, three months after the birth of my fourth child, I went to do a job as a research assistant.
Dirt poor, living in the home with my parents, I couldn't afford to.
I bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll.
She came to me bloated, very pale.
She goes to school on the first day.
When these girls sit, you unlock intelligence, you unlock passion, you unlock commitment, you unlock focus, you unlock great leaders.
Says, "Leymah, my wish is to be educated.
This is another African girl's wish.
Today, this young woman is me, a Nobel laureate.
Thank you so much.
So I'm troubled when I see them like there's no hope.
These girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration.
Leymah, thank you. Thank you so much for coming to TED.
Licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the Internet.
Silently, without much fanfare, this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess.
It displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called "meaningful adjacency."
Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem, design the solution around what the human will do as well.
These are necessary but insufficient questions.
Computers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors, but humans do. Humans, using technology, testing hypotheses, searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them.
In October, 2007, U.S. and coalition forces raided an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar on the Syrian border of Iraq.
Analyzing this data was hard. The originals were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated.
Thank you.
Not a very useful skill, especially when the money runs out.
We should stop looking outside.
We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life.
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime.
You can't do it all in one day.
There's nothing in my life apart from my work.
I truly understand how that can be daunting.
The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog: an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998.
And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined.
I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility -- which I do.
This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits.
Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto.
Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to.
And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.
That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a greenway movement in the South Bronx.
And they provide habitats for our little friends!
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable.
I'm interested in what I like to call the "triple bottom line" that sustainable development can produce.
Now let's get this straight. I am not anti-development.
Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking: a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx.
We have no excuse in this country. I'm sorry.
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return.
Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count.
And this is what happens.
Will it be possible that this will happen?
And if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics -- here we go, here we go, here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago.
The last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe, because most of this statistics is Europe.
We have a function here -- I can tell the world, "Stay where you are."
And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized, is that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America, are much more ahead in being healthy, educated, having human resources than they are economically.
And there's a lot of infrastructure things, and general human resources are there.
That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.
And my daughter, she was born in Chile, and the grand-daughter was born in Singapore, now the healthiest country on this Earth.
Carbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.
The OECD countries -- the high-income countries -- they were the ones who caused the climate change.
Everyone lives on this street here.
I lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here.
I spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers who were on the verge of famine.
Getting out of poverty.
Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.
What is this, what is this, what am I telling?
Let me first grade what are the most important means.
Money is not a goal.
Human rights is the goal, but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.
Sword swallowing is from ancient India.
So I thought, this would be an opportunity to use Scratch to make an interactive card for my mom.
So I really enjoyed looking at these projects and interacting with these projects.
And it's similar with new technologies.
about whether all the children there should learn to code.
Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website, there's everything from animated stories to school science projects to anime soap operas to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls to trigonometry tutorials to interactive artwork, and, yes, interactive Mother's Day cards.
So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect, where you interact with gestures in the world.
When you learn to read, you can then read to learn.
And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago, I saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our Scratch software to create a game somewhat like this one, and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game, but also he wanted to do more.
And it's in fact working.
As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts, he was also learning about the process of design, how to start with the glimmer of an idea and turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project like you see here.
But it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write.
And it's fair to say that in these 10 years, we've witnessed absolutely the start of a scientific revolution -- that of genome medicine.
It's three proteins -- Ras, Myc and P53.
And so, I guess you'd say, dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines, I went back to school in chemistry with the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry and approaching it in the context of this brave new world of the open-source, the crowd-source, the collaborative network that we have access to within academia, that we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies to our patients.
We developed libraries of compounds and eventually arrived at this and similar substances called JQ1.
The cancer cells, small, round and rapidly dividing, grew these arms and extensions.
Could we take this precious and rare cancerous material from this chest tube and drive it across town and put it into mice and try to do a clinical trial and stage it with a prototype drug?
The mice with this cancer that get the drug live, and the ones that don't rapidly perish.
Because now when we've shared this molecule, just since December of last year, with 40 laboratories in the United States and 30 more in Europe -- many of them pharmaceutical companies seeking now to enter this space, to target this rare cancer that, thankfully right now, is quite desirable to study in that industry.
For us, a major and exciting milestone.
And one thing I've learned in Boston is that you people will do anything for cancer -- and I love that.
There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe.
If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity, it would be moving away from you.
You might say, "Well, maybe things just smoothed themselves out."
There is something that made it that way.
A high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way.
We'd like to understand that.
Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster so we say the universe is accelerating.
Back when I was your age, we didn't know what the universe was going to do.
In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole, even though you think it's black, it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics.
It will probably increase, and the probability is enormously huge.
And then, of course, in the natural course of things, they will expand back.
That's the region where entropy is low.
The good news is that, therefore, this scenario does not work; it is not right.
Here is the universe that we tell you about, versus the universe that really exists.
You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness.
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken.
But we've been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like, why it came to be in the way it did for many, many years.
On the stage that day, I was so nervous.
Like everyone else, we grew maize.
I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields.
So I decided I would build one windmill for myself.
And the reporters came too, which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED.
Rather than using it for my computer, I actually opened it.
But you can also search in the digital world, or maybe you can write a query, saying, "What is Dr. Smith's address?"
I was taking some part of the objects, or any of the intuitiveness of real life, and bringing them to the digital world, because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive.
I think that's why this is called a head-mounted projector, isn't it?
And, actually, if you see, there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it.
And later I can find a wall, anywhere, and start browsing those photos or maybe, "OK, I want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend."
When I'm going back, I can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed, because at that particular time, I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone, and checking out a particular icon.
I removed the microphone from that, and then just pinched that -- like I just made a clip out of the microphone -- and clipped that to a piece of paper, any paper that you found around.
This is incredible, really.
Open source? Wow.
So I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment.
And it's great to be here as the mayor of Rio.
We had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology.
You probably think about a city full of energy, a vibrant city full of green.
If you don't have open spaces, you've got to go there and open spaces.
cities are packed with people.
This is a map of Rio.
But the point we want to make here tonight is, favelas are not always a problem.
But what you've got to do to get that is you've got to go inside the favelas, bring in the basic services -- mainly education and health -- with high quality.
This is a place with high technology where the kids that live in a poor house next to this place can go inside and have access to all technology.
We have New Year's Eve.
And I wanted to show that I can govern my city, using technology, from here, from Long Beach, so I got here last night and I know everything.
EP: Okay, how's the traffic?
We had heavy traffic early in the morning and in the rush hour in the afternoon, but nothing of big concern.
That is fantastic.
Now this is an extremely complicated subject, in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different.
Or, as some people, especially academics prefer, beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder.
We need to reverse-engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric, largely pleistocene environments, where we became fully human, but also by the social situations in which we evolved.
Natural selection also explains pleasures -- sexual pleasure, our liking for sweet, fat and proteins, which in turn explains a lot of popular foods, from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs.
Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind, we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination, even obsession, in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction.
The landscape shows the presence of water directly in view, or evidence of water in a bluish distance, indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally -- get this -- a path or a road, perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline, that extends into the distance, almost inviting you to follow it.
But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that.
It's hard to grasp, but it's an incredible fact.
Your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it, even before they could put their love into words.
The material I'm going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas.
I met the last Air Force General who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat.
Here's my parody and it ain't much of one.
Prometheus approach, largely a geographic definition, focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict.
There is nobody we can't take down.
Who do you access in this transition space?
We have an unparalleled capacity to wage war.
What we need to build is a force for the Everything Else.
Like Saddam, like Mugabe, like Kim Jong-Il -- people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions.
That gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the 1990s.
They love to put them on trial. They've got Milosevic right now.
France says, "No, but I do like to criticize you after the fact."
They said, "You're that powerful, you can resurrect this country.
Here's my challenge to the Defense Department.
And if you can't find one you've got to make one up.
For eight years, after screwing up the relationship on day one -- inauguration day with gays in the military -- which was deft.
Can you come back next year and remind us again?"
Certain bad things you cannot do.
A big stick, a baton stick.
What's happened since is that bifurcation I described.
I supported the war in Iraq.
This is the military the rest of the world wants us to build.
The rest -- wider array of partners.
It's everything the man's military hates.
One takes down networks, one puts them up.
Inter agency-ize it, internationalize it.
This is the history of the marines -- small wars, small arms.
I tell young officers, "You may command 500 ships in your career.
Special Operations Command down at Tampa.
I want to keep trigger-pullers trigger-happy.
Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see.
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?
Well, it's a rather complex system, but let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.
So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices, and we're now focusing more on the informational devices.
So basically that's how it works.
Third box is out. The fourth box is out.
The sensors that are used can see through the dark, the fog and rain.
Underneath, I was actually deeply unhappy, insecure and fundamentally frightened -- frightened of other people, of the future, of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me.
"She is going to a lecture."
And to be fair, I was desperate for interest and help, and I began to tell him about my strange commentator.
Helplessly and hopelessly, I began to retreat into this nightmarish inner world in which the voices were destined to become both my persecutors and my only perceived companions.
I'd been diagnosed, drugged and discarded, and was by now so tormented by the voices that I attempted to drill a hole in my head in order to get them out.
Now, at first, this was very difficult to believe, not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing, so in this respect, a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth.
Throughout all of this, what I would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself, and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had an opportunity to process or resolve, memories of sexual trauma and abuse, of anger, shame, guilt, low self-worth.
As Peter Levine has said, the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity.
I happen to live in a little town, Princeton, in New Jersey, which every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history: the Battle of Princeton, which was, in fact, a very important battle.
I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology, because I think I know very little about that -- I'm not a biologist -- so everything I know about it can be said in one minute.
The important fact is, that most of the real estate that's accessible to us -- I'm not talking about the stars, I'm talking about the solar system, the stuff that's within reach for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes -- most of the real estate is very cold and very far from the Sun.
Ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate, just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa, to go down through the ice, find out who is swimming around in the ocean, whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters -- whatever there may be that's exciting --- or cephalopods.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
They'd need, first of all, to have a thick skin to protect themselves from losing water through the skin.
There's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there. And I mean, the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole.
That if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces -- either on Europa, or further out, anywhere where you can live on a cold surface -- those creatures must be provided with reflectors.
Because it means that -- the way life can live out there, it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet.
So they can collect sunlight from a big area.
We transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful than it is today.
And so, I fused together the two things I loved the most, which was skiing and windsurfing.
So, in anticipation, I would be this young designer in the back of the room, and I would raise my hand, and I would ask questions.
And then I saw this quote: "advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."
So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.
I mean, think about it: the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry, or accessories is really important, so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.
You know, there is some push and pull, but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out.
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.
In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.
So, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic, to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.
In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.
So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.
I was in these venues, and people were, you know, really into getting them. They were excited.
Two years ago, on this very stage, we premiered Virtual Choir 2, 2,052 singers from 58 different countries, this time performing a piece that I had written called "Sleep."
We deal in milliseconds.
They're saving us by redefining and re-imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities, polarities we've taken for granted for a long time, like the ones between modernity and tradition, First World and Third World, oppression and opportunity.
Much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions.
A flock of relatives descended on her.
Women don't make those rules, but they define us, and they define our opportunities and our chances.
She walked into my office at a time when no one knew where Afghanistan was in the United States.
She starts every lecture with a prayer, but she's a single, feisty, financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12.
In post-conflict societies like Croatia, where a hyper-nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast.
Improbably, this LGBT singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change, like alchemists turning discord into harmony.
Layma was not an activist, she was a mother of three.
"What does it matter?" they said, "A bullet doesn't distinguish between a Muslim and a Christian."
In a now famous CNN clip, you can see them sitting on the ground, their arms linked.
She said, "I don't know if he did it because he believed, but he knew we were not going to leave.
That's the heat from the bottom.
And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism, that the personal is in fact the political.
Well, today I fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox, fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most, but most of all, fueled by crates of mail like this one, my trusty mail crate, filled with the scriptings of ordinary people, strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee, but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing.
And so I could tell you about a woman whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan, and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation, and so she tucks love letters throughout the house as a way to say, "Come back to me.
And as a chemist, one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is, could we make a really cool universal chemistry set?
And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software.
You put it in your search engine, and you create the drug to treat the threat.
There was no separation of sexes.
And I had to pay, order and eat at the male section.
Because many scholars who study the history of Islamic thought -- Muslim scholars or Westerners -- think that actually the practice of dividing men and women physically came as a later development in Islam, as Muslims adopted some preexisting cultures and traditions of the Middle East.
But also the non-Muslim communities of North Africa -- the Animists, even some Christians and even a Jewish tribe in North Africa is known to practice female circumcision.
Now that is pretty authoritarian, and that's something I'm very much critical of.
The name of the book is "Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty."
These things which make Islamic Law, the troubling aspects of Islamic Law, were later developed into later interpretations of Islam.
But not just that; also democracy, parliament, the idea of representation, the idea of equal citizenship.
But there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the 20th century, because we see a sharp decline in this Islamic modernist line.
In the 19th century, when Muslims were looking at Europe as an example, they were independent; they were more self-confident.
There was one country, though, which was able to escape or stay away from that vicious cycle.
And Arab masses just revolted against their dictators.
They just should be allowed to work for that.
You really would be kind of out of luck.
So what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the Golgi stain.
And there's several ways of doing this.
And researchers have used this fact in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain, recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually.
And only much later did scientists come onto the scene and say, "Hey, these are tools, these are functions that we could use in our own research tool palette."
For nearly two decades now, the news has been bad and the images have been haunting.
The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be.
To put it differently, for the civilians that suffer the consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war, there is no good war and there is no bad peace.
But let's look at the good news again.
And significantly, there's also a clear focus on both the rights of individuals and the rights of communities.
Not all the issues that needed to be resolved were actually covered in the agreements.
Second, an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by Western support for Kosovo's independence.
Leadership needs to be capable, determined and visionary in its commitment to peace.
For me personally, the most critical lesson of all is this: Local commitment to peace is all-important, but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence.
It's a story about you and me, nature and science.
But this planet is different -- it's roiling inside.
Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate.
Fish tried amphibian life. Frogs adapted to deserts.
Life turned hard so it could venture inland.
Plants began to diversify and grew, turning into trees.
Extinction can come slowly, but sometimes it arrives fast.
Some mammals turned back to water.
Thank you. Thank you.
I was with my brother and a mate having a few beers, and I was watching the world go by, had a few more beers, and the conversation turned to '70s fashion —  — and how everything manages to come back into style.
Parents would shuffle kids away from us.
I said to him, "I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization."
Every day -- this morning, I wake up and go, my life is about a mustache.
But we thought, you know what, if that's the worst thing that happens, so what?
But he said, "We will partner with you, but we're not going to invest in it. You need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work."
And that makes Movember now the biggest funder of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world.
And we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi, and I didn't tell him who I was, because I didn't think it was appropriate, and I just shook his hand and I said, "Thank you so much.
And he said, "I grew the worst mustache ever."
So they identified that as a priority, and then they've got and recruited now 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic, essentially the same topic.
This is Benki.
His grandfather died when he was only 10.
Some did, not everybody.
Why are you putting yourself at risk?
We're running out of land.
Now I don't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends.
Since that time, Samraksha has grown from strength to strength and is now one of the leading health NGO's in India.
She wanted to change policy at the government level.
And they sit around, and they talk about dreams.
He was born in 1957, and you can imagine what his childhood looked like and felt like, and what his life has been like over the last 50 tumultuous years.
Why did he do all this?
They didn't go to business school.
It's not about them, they know that, but it has to start with them.
"How come?" said Kartikeya.
'My world' tells us why the sun rises, why we were born.
It took place, once, in 326 B.C.
Then the gymnosophist asked, "What are you doing?"
They told him of a great hero called Achilles, who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured, but when he withdrew from the battle, defeat was inevitable.
And if you have lived an extraordinary life, you will be welcomed to Elysium, or what the French call "Champs-Élysées" -- -- the heaven of the heroes.
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist.
It was called the Vaitarani.
The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity.
But if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic, with opinion, with contextual thinking, with everything is relative, sort of -- mostly.
It's always about taste.
You see, this is what India is today. The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view.
I love mythology too much.
Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly.
He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India.
You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan.
And it's a very dangerous question, because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence.
Who sees it all?
I know some of you have already decided you want a good career.
You're afraid if you look for your passion and don't find it, you'll feel like you're an idiot, so then you make excuses about why you're not going to look for your passion.
But guess what? This is almost 2012, and saying to the world, "I am totally, completely competent," is damning yourself with the faintest of praise.
Mommy and Daddy told me that if I worked hard, I'd have a good career. So, if you work hard and have a good career, if you work really, really, really hard, you'll have a great career. Doesn't that, like, mathematically make sense?"
You say, "I have an interest!" I say, "That's wonderful!
Passion is your greatest love.
But what that tombstone should have said, in an alternative lifetime, what it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent, was, "Here lies the last Nobel Laureate in Physics, who formulated the Grand Unified Field Theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive."
Now, do you really want me to say now, tell you, "Really, I swear I don't kick children."
You know what will happen someday, you, you ideal parent, you?
And what are you going to say?
You could have said, looked the kid in the face, and said, "Go for it, kid, just like I did."
You're afraid to try. You're afraid you may fail.
There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography -- women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all.
What I am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about 10 years ago when a patient asked me a question.
Two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue, which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.
So it's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast.
The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment, and what have we gained from that investment?
The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive.
And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don't realize are problems.
But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen, and this is it.
And you can see that it looks a lot different.
And the detector then transmits the image to the computer.
And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study, and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram, but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.
After achieving what we felt were remarkable results, our manuscript was rejected by four journals.
The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram.
So it takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer.
Thank you.
And there's this loud, thrilling music in the background, this wild music.
I can look at your medical records; I can see if your pump is still pumping -- see if you're good to offer insurance to.
Now I see some puzzled looks like, "Why are you asking us what's the right thing to do?
Next question, a little bit harder.
Yeah, that's a terrifying result.
Maybe we just follow our gut.
Plato, that's right.
I don't want opinions; I want knowledge.
They all participate in the truths that two has.
That's as ambitious as we are.
If you think that, Plato's not your guy.
And what if he's been sending little messages to Bin Laden's hideout -- or whoever took over after Bin Laden -- and he's actually like a terrorist, a sleeper cell.
There are things that are intrinsically wrong -- like lying is wrong, like torturing innocent children is wrong.
What should we be doing? What's the answer?
You can't just take human thinking and put it into a machine.
Every person in this room do this: think of the last time you had a decision to make where you were worried to do the right thing, where you wondered, "What should I be doing?"
Stop. Good work.
Just a few days ago, right across the street from here, there was hundreds of people gathered together.
It's based on Norse legend.
It's you. It's me.
Marketing creates user groups.
So I worked with white noise.
It seems to be magic.
I don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot.
K is a daylight receiver transmitter.
I'm just a designer. So I need them.
Anyway, this project, or this experience, make me start a new project on the design of medicine.
And here you can get the white core.
So by this way, the kid, to take care of himself, is to take care of this living object.
So the living benches would be exactly like the ball.
Because it is a kind of object with a conscience, able to be modified by its surroundings, and able to modify it as well.
So it uses some plants to do this job, selected for their gas-filtering ability.
But the idea is to force the air to go in the effective part of the plants.
Indeed, this object is a domestic farm, for fishes and green.
Amazing channel.
This is an inspiration image to lead this project of the office.
It's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people's tragedy than your own, and I want to keep it in the spirit of the conference.
And then third, I want to tell you, in a very superficial way, about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records -- the books -- of the gang.
The gang had no way to make money.
So, as a result, as a gang leader, you had, you know, power -- it's a pretty good life -- but the thing was, in the end, you were living at home with your mother.
So what was it about crack cocaine?
At least for the people in the top.
He was really a curious sight to be seen.
What Sudhir found out is, in fact, that the real answer was the following -- The survey was not, in the end, going to be what got Sudhir off the hook.
And that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship that involved Sudhir living in the housing project on and off for 10 years: hanging out in crack houses, going to jail with the gang members, having the car-windows shot out of his car, having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks -- you name it.
So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the sort of bottom line of what I take away from the gang is, is that if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization, it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's.
Which, it turned out, for this black gang, was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors that they undertook.
And important to note that almost all of the weight, all of the people in this organization are at the bottom.
The hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $3.50 in an hour.
They weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways, because there were no legitimate channels out.
You're in the gang for four years; you expect to die with about a 25 percent likelihood.
The first set of people in Silicon Valley got very, very rich.
And so for instance, one thing the gang would do is -- you know, the gang leaders would have big entourages, and they'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry.
So I have a couple minutes.
So it turns out -- I'm sort of getting ahead of myself.
Here's the translation you get from the gang member.
No matter how bad it was economically, he always got himself paid.
Paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider, with the possibility to fly cross-country, distance, just with the use of thermals to soar.
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet.
Or here -- everybody was freezing, pretty much, except me, because it was very cold in Austria where we did this filming.
And I want to set a new record, with the longest distance ever flown.
UE: Parachute. We have to open a parachute just seconds before, I would say, impact.
UE: Hopefully not.
UE: Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet because of landings -- usually it's difficult -- it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings.
I would consider the studio more like a laboratory.
This whole idea of sharing, the idea of constituting reality by overlapping what I say and what you say -- think of a movie.
It was about a space in which I put half a semi-circular yellow disk.
I would say yes. It is obviously about not just about decorating the world, and making it look even better, or even worse, if you ask me.
If I take a stand, it makes a difference."
A crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top, which I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland.
The moment you start to move, the mountain starts to move.
Of course being an iconic city like New York, that has had an interest in somehow playing around with the sense of space, you could say that New York wants to seem as big as possible.
One could say this is about community, collectivity.
So what is between thinking and doing?
In assessing the merits of such tales, it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time," and a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit."
But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the Ventana.
Edith Widder : Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there.
How could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?
We miss him.
What I really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people's words.
The next poem is "If No One Ever Marries Me."
She died alone in 1940 in the company of her books and her dear friends.
And my blood froze when I read that because I had written the plain-song music 130 years after he'd written the letter.
Gradually, bringing it down, bringing it down.
Dolphins aren't the only animals, the only non-human animals, to show mirror self-recognition.
We are not alone in these abilities.
Look at this body.
This is Delphi and Pan, and you're going to see Delphi hitting a key, he hears a computer-generated whistle -- -- and gets a ball, so they can actually ask for things they want.
Peter Gabriel: I make noises for a living.
I want to hear a grooming song.
So that night, we began to dream, and we thought, perhaps the most amazing tool that man's created is the Internet, and what would happen if we could somehow find new interfaces, visual-audio interfaces that would allow these remarkable sentient beings that we share the planet with access?
In the daytime they live outside. It's nighttime there now.
Allison Ginsburg: Good evening.
And the third user group, in Thailand, is Think Elephants. Go ahead, Josh.
Thirty years ago, we turned it on.
This is the system as it looks today, by the way.
All kinds of possible sentient beings may be interconnected through this system, and I can't wait to see these experiments unfold.
What that means is that what we're learning with these interactions with other species will teach us, ultimately, how we might interact with an alien from another world.
The idea is this will be -- much like the Internet functions as a network of networks, which is Vint's core contribution, this will be a wrapper around all of these initiatives, that are wonderful individually, to link them globally.
I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted.
And later on in the night, I woke up because I'm always waking up in the night, and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots, you know, on Facebook, which I've never seen before.
People are crying, and she came, she read the text, and she started to cry.
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too."
The day after, Iranians started to respond with their own posters.
Because when you're seeing the Middle East, you see only the bad news.
Something crazy also happened.
And for a few days you got those images.
And that was the end of it.
And for every guy from Israel, you've got someone from Iran.
And really, we can be our own ambassadors.
Is the latest tower in London a gherkin or a sausage or a sex tool?
Recently, Obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis.
And through a process of architectural selection, we might choose a really beautiful model or we might have a very functional model.
So as a result, we never throw anything out.
But then we had a meeting with a Chinese businessman who saw our design and said, "Wow, that's the Chinese character for the word 'people.'" So, apparently this is how you write "people," as in the People's Republic of China.
So we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples where a sustainable city actually increases the quality of life.
The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid.
So we thought, why don't we reintroduce the bicycle in China?
But in fact, the container ships go full of goods from China to Denmark, and then they sail empty back.
And to our surprise we got one of our boards back with corrections from the Chinese state censorship.
But to conclude, if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December next year, don't come to Copenhagen, because she's going to be in Shanghai.
And he said that he was going to do an apartment block next to a parking structure.
It's actually a stand-up product from Switzerland, because in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators.
We took him to see the Mountain. And he got very excited by this idea that you could actually make mountains out of architecture, because Azerbaijan is known as the Alps of Central Asia.
It has no water. It has no energy, no resources.
And this summer we are starting the construction documents of the two first mountains, in what's going to be the first carbon-neutral island in Central Asia.
Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world.
We don't actually solve all problems.
But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems.
And also -- and that's, of course, where economics gets evil -- to put down what are the things we should not do, first.
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list.
What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome?
If you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist.
I'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects.
But it's saying that what we can do about it is very little, at a very high cost.
We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet.
Again, sanitation and water is incredibly important, but it also costs a lot of infrastructure.
Again, the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty, very radically fast, in about two to five years.
One is treatment; the other one is prevention.
estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today.
Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures.
In 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world.
You know, when you ask the world's best economists, you inevitably end up asking old, white American men.
And that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities, and saying, what is the important thing in the world?
Thank you.
Thus, there's understandably a deep-seated presumption among Westerners that the whole world will decide to adopt private capitalism as the model of economic growth, liberal democracy, and will continue to prioritize political rights over economic rights.
Now, don't get me wrong.
Perhaps what is more disturbing is that China's income equality has been improving in recent times, whereas that of the United States has been declining.
That is the system that seems to work."
The evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing.
If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model, and in effect go around the world and continue to try and push an agenda of private capitalism and liberal democracy, this is basically going against headwinds, but it also would be a natural stance for the West to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the Chinese model of de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.
In fact, there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law.
Just to illustrate, I went into my annals of myself.
We might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open-minded to seek the truth.
So we trained them to be able to do three separate words, to lay out them properly.
He says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant, the unconscious.
And if you look at a guy called Dennis, when he decides what to become -- is it a lawyer, or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher? -- best chance is that he wants to become a dentist.
I'm a big list maker, so I came up with a list.
Working on projects that actually have visible impacts, like a book for a deceased German artist whose widow came to us with the requirement to make her late husband famous.
And I've found that it influenced my life and work in a very intriguing way.
We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below 30 degrees C.
And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid.
It's over 90 percent water, so we need to let that evaporate.
Align it in this direction.
Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings.
It's probably -- part of the project's still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.
So, this simple narrative equating Western demand and Chinese suffering is appealing, especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world, but it's also inaccurate and disrespectful.
I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them more, they won't understand anyway."
When I asked Lu Qingmin, the young woman I got to know best, what exactly she did on the factory floor, she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like "qiu xi."
Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories, on the other hand, plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make.
The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor.
I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min and her sisters.
Very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be.
But I'm curious. If you had a minute, say, with Apple's head of manufacturing, what would you say?
I mean, it would be nice to have those things, but that's not why they're in the city, and that's not what they care about.
I spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bombers and with Taliban recruiters, trying to understand how the Taliban were converting these children into live ammunition and why these children were actively signing up to their cause.
How do the Taliban in your area get people to join them?
Step one is that the Taliban prey on families that are large, that are poor, that live in rural areas.
The children are virtual prisoners; they cannot leave, they cannot go home.
Boy: I would love to.
As one Taliban recruiter told me, "There will always be sacrificial lambs in this war."
And what was even more striking to me, and what I really got hung up on, was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own.
And this seemed astounding. The Internet is a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions.
Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben, because that's where you get the best reception, but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation.
There's a very short list of these places.
They connect in a manhole like this. Literally, this is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in.
And Tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables, one across the Atlantic and one across the Pacific, and proceeded to add pieces onto them, until they had built a belt around the world, which means they will send your bits to the East or the West.
And it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud, but every time we put something on the cloud, we give up some responsibility for it.
This is a 3D printer.
And it will change and disrupt the landscape of manufacturing, and most certainly our lives, our businesses and the lives of our children.
And over time -- quite rapidly actually, in a number of hours -- we can build a physical product, ready to take out of the machine and use.
It sounds great.
The detail that you can get today is quite amazing.
Now this is an engine component.
And then taking this idea of creating a very detailed structure, we can apply it to honeycomb structures and use them within implants.
So imagine you have, say, a Hoover in your home and it has broken down. You need a spare part, but you realize that Hoover's been discontinued.
We're all familiar with the idea of customization or personalization.
This is a lamp.
This means lower carbon footprint.
While you wait at the dentist, a machine will quietly be creating this for you ready to insert in the teeth.
So just to finalize, we're all individual.
It is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran.
But within that group, a tiny, smaller group, a minority within a minority within a minority, were coming up with a new and dangerous conception of jihad, and in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden, and he refined the idea.
And it filled this old imam, it filled him with great sadness.
Does it mean we can break out the champagne, wash our hands of it, disengage, sleep easy at night?
Usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism, or it's a power struggle.
And then the Yemeni military got its act together, and ordinary people rose up against these guys and drove them out, and since then, most of their activities, most of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis.
What are those lessons? We know who killed bin Laden: SEAL Team Six.
Who killed bin Ladenism? Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed it.
Now, not all of these things will work in local jihad.
We've got plenty of these things.
And when we were walking through the narrow alleys, it was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes.
I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face, and I asked her to tell me her story.
And she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all."
And by many definitions she is no longer poor.
When I asked her if she feared anything, or whether she would miss anything from Mathare, she said, "What would I fear that I haven't confronted already?
And I say, 'Look at me. You are not dead.
A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days.
Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa.
So here's my question to you: What are you waiting for?
And I really felt that there would be potential to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light.
But then, in the second year of Caltech, they started grading.
And I started looking at how we could build battery back-up systems that could give people five hours, 10 hours, maybe even a full day, or three days' worth of back-up power.
And it really needed to get much lower than that to be cost effective.
First of all, there was a lot of new manufacturing techniques, not to mention really cheap miniature motors -- brushless motors, servo motors, stepper motors, that are used in printers and scanners and things like that.
Those shapes are parabolas.
So, about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component.
I mean, all of the improvements he made -- and it's justifiable that our measure of energy, the watt, today is named after him.
You could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space, and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications.
Normally, efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine over its life dwarfs the cost of the engine.
That's a heat engine.
What about if I put a thermal sponge in the middle, in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold?
We measured each one, we readjusted the model to what we measured, and then we led that to the current prototype.
The petals track and the engine gets the concentrated sunlight, take that heat and turn it into electricity.
It doesn't really care.
But by reducing your energy use, pretty much at the peak times -- usually when you have you air conditioning on, or other times like that -- this generates the peak power at the peak usage time, so it's very complementary in that sense.
But if you don't have grid-supplied electricity, then the whole question of payback is a different one entirely.
It just makes economic sense.
Of course, now I'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake.
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change, and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog.
And in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more, there are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics, things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules.
But still, we look at the pieces.
And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us.

And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU, at a very good time, in 1967, where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU.
And we started a studio.
It was a very high, it was a very impersonal time in design and we wanted to say, the content is what's important, not the package, not the wrapping.
So, in writing for children, it seems simple, and it is.
So, I get to put in all of the things that I love.
Well, he has some hair but -- well, he used to have hair.
But you know, we said, "David, who's going to know?
And then, "Be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand."
And I said, "Yes, but how much space do I have?"
And then, we don't have a stuffed Spinoza, but we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog, and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg, in Russia.
And then I want to tell you that this is a map.
But in her lexicon, "sorry, the rest unknown, thank you" is "sorry, the rest unknown, go to hell," because she couldn't care less.
It is February and not lying is impossible."
And so, you know, I talk to my friends and I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs.
So, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment.
And it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kindness.
And what I mostly say is that, at that time, it was a pretty interesting idea to me.
When I was 14, I escaped from Tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father, my relatives, my friends and my homeland.
Along with outward development and increase of opportunity, there should be inward development and deepening of our heart connections as well as our outward connections.
But the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spirituality on the part of the Muslim and Buddhist traditions.
We have hear, this week, about the horrible sufferings, for example, that so many women of the world are enduring day-to-day.
TD: Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard, even in inviting me, let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen, and I was somewhat resistant at times, and I was also very nervous throughout this week.
Meanwhile, we have illegal immigrants doing all the work, but we don't have any robots.
It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which way it's tilting.
So, we'll move forward to a different idea.
It's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process.
While globalization has increased travel, it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere, all the time, all over the world.
In domestic birds, especially chickens, it's 100 percent lethal.
It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.
So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive.
The result: most of the deaths have been in people under 30 years of age, robustly healthy young adults.
In fact, the federal government says it's a guy called the Principle Federal Officer, who happens to be with TSA.
The vaccine will probably be useless.
And some states have differential policies, county by county.
And that's just office workers, bankers.
You'll end up buying -- this is called an N95 mask. Ridiculous.
Nevertheless most of the governments have based their whole flu policies on building stockpiles of Tamiflu.
And the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate.
We don't actually know how many people died.
I don't think that's rational.
Well if you have a dot-com, maybe you can.
Audience member: What kind of triggers are you looking for?
The mechanism isn't clear.
It tells you if you have H5N1.
And after circulating around the world came back in a form that was tremendously lethal.
And so far in the H5N1 cases in people, similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all.
But it's not bacterial pneumonia.
So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles.
For an hour and a half I shared with the audience a lifetime of creativity, how I pursue perfection, how I cheat the impossible.
When I was six years old, I fell in love with magic.
And I go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him, "Well what do you think?"
So that's it. I'm 14; I'm becoming a juggler.
I was pretty fast, but I was not fluid at all.
Tenacity is how I kept at it against all odds.
What did I need? I needed the widest shoes in the world.
The murmur of the city dissolves into a squall whose chilling power I no longer feel.
An inner howl assails me, the wild longing to flee.
So each time I draw my circle of chalk on the pavement and enter as the improvising comic silent character I created 45 years ago, I am as happy as when I am in the clouds.
Now I have done the impossible not once, but many times.
Now comes the day of the walk.
And then in the most magnificent gesture, I send the bird of peace into the azure.
So I take a bow. I salute with my hand.
For a moment, the entire crowd had forgotten their differences.
I'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy, and share with you what canopy researchers are asking and also how they're communicating with other people outside of science.
One of the reasons I tell you about ants is because of my husband, who is in fact an ant taxonomist and when we got married, he promised to name an ant after me, which he did -- Procryptocerus nalini, a canopy ant.
And these mosses, generated by decomposing, are like peat moss in your garden.
And I use this little image to say this is what happens to mosses.
I've also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives.
And so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy, the beauty of the canopy, the necessity of intact canopies, to people outside of academia.
I'll just give you a few examples.
That's Duke!
They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work.
And they will have the pleasure, many of them, of seeing those frogs that they've raised from eggs and helped develop, helped nurture, move out into protected wildlands to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild.
By making these partnerships that I described to you, I have really opened my mind and, I have to say, my heart to have a greater understanding, to make other discoveries about nature and myself.
If they went exploring into the parents' rooms, or even into the secret filing cabinets, they were punished, and told that for their own good they must never go in there again.
Well, I'm the girl in that story, and the secret documents that I was interested in were located in this building, the British Parliament, and the data that I wanted to get my hands on were the expense receipts of members of Parliament.
What they hadn't counted on was digitization, because that meant that all those paper receipts had been scanned in electronically, and it was very easy for somebody to just copy that entire database, put it on a disk, and then just saunter outside of Parliament, which they did, and then they shopped that disk to the highest bidder, which was the Daily Telegraph, and then, you all remember, there was weeks and weeks of revelations, everything from porn movies and bath plugs and new kitchens and mortgages that had never been paid off.
No, it's about trying to find the truth based on what you can see and what can be tested.
And it's getting harder to hide assets, tax avoidance, pay inequality. So that's great. We're starting to find out more and more about these systems.
You can try and find out how he's moving out assets from that country.
Do you know the one I mean? Where the little dog Toto runs across to where the wizard [is], and he pulls back, the dog's pulling back the curtain, and -- "Don't look behind the screen. Don't look at the man behind the screen."
The other thing is that power is incredibly seductive, and you must have two real qualities, I think, when you come to the table, when you're dealing with power, talking about power, because of its seductive capacity.
Now wouldn't it be amazing, and really, this is what I want all of you to think about, if we had an Official Disclosure Act where officials were punished if they were found to have suppressed or hidden information that was in the public interest?
So he was talking about the law in Britain which is the Communications Data Bill, an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation.
But the world isn't a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge.
And more exciting was the fact that the person who took this photo was a guy named Jack Randall, the greatest living ichthyologist on Earth, the Grand Poobah of fish nerds, if you will.
If you look at this diagram of a coral reef, we know a lot about that part up near the top, and the reason we know so much about it is scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it.
If you were to go down to a depth of about 130 feet, which is the recommended limit for most scuba divers, you get this pressure effect.
Well, in the context of diving, you get too much, you die also.
Now the one thing that I forgot to mention, is that to obviate the problem of the nitrogen narcosis -- all of those blue dots in our body -- you remove the nitrogen and you replace it with helium.
And it was fine and dandy, and it allowed us to go down and find new species.
One, they're quiet, they don't make any noise.
They allow you to mechanically breathe, or mechanically ventilate.
But, if we only had an oxygen gas supply cylinder we wouldn't be able to go very deep, because we'd run into oxygen toxicity very, very quickly.
And the way you manage all these different gases and all these different gas supplies is this really high-tech, sophisticated gas block up on the front here, where it's easy to reach.
That's kind of what it feels like. It's pretty amazing.
They're still new species because I had a video camera on this dive instead of my net, so they're still waiting down there for someone to go find them.
Richard Pyle: When you start talking like Donald Duck, there's no situation in the world that can seem tense.
Now, you've seen video like this on TV a lot, and it's very intimidating, and I think it gives the wrong impression about sharks.
It questions whether or not there really are any new frontiers out there, whether there are any real, true, hardcore discoveries that can still be made.
This one we actually first discovered back in the air days -- the bad old air days, as we used to say -- when we were doing these kind of dives with air.
And this is another neat one.
What's extraordinary about this is not just the sheer number of species we're finding -- although as you can see that's pretty amazing, this is only half of what we've found -- what's extraordinary is how quickly we find them.
And the second goal, for those of us who have mastered that first goal, is to -- you know, you call it spiritual fulfillment, you can call it financial success, you can call it any number of different things.
Thanks.
Which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder.
A program called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain.
It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic.
For too long now, children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen.
One thing I wanted to say about film making is -- about this film -- in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here, Michael Moschen, and some of the talks about music, this idea that there is a narrative line, and that music exists in time.
They play off each other in a wonderful way.
Richard Saul Wurman: I remember hearing him talk at Penn.
I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station, it was so consistent with his life, you know?
Architect? I've heard about him; he's a top-ranking architect.
No, he never saw this.
But he was also human.
You have to understand that.
Perspective is a very powerful thing.
What if they look up at the night sky, at the same stars, but from the opposite side?
Alright, one billion stars.
Even our nearest star, the Sun -- its emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed.
The second is that problems are soluble.
And the other thing that one should take away from this chart is the very narrow range of time over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet.
So this "ascent" of man, pinnacle of evolution, has got to go.
Now Drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence, but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft, and that's that terrestrial technology can interfere with the search for extraterrestrial technology.
And over those long distances, its signal is very faint when it reaches us.
Why?
If SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet, then it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history.
Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record.
Their entire camp, every item of gear, was ferried 885 miles from McMurdo Station, the main U.S. supply base on the coast of Antarctica.
It's really a time machine.
Every year, it begins with a snowflake, and by digging into fresh snow, we can see how this process is ongoing today.
Don't we already know how they affect temperatures?
They have to, in fact, make sure this ice never gets warmer than about 20 degrees below zero, otherwise, the key gases inside it will dissipate.
The wind that rubs against it gives it voice.
So, very unexpectedly, they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales.
Maybe a decade, according to my friends in Detroit.
It could well be enough to double the oil price, for example.
In the process, we will gain about a million good jobs, mainly rural.
You can sort of have it all with these things.
But then the next generation of planes saves about half.
And it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels.
But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour, the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones, weighing a total of 15 pounds, hidden in the front end.
Now, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil, including buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on, you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025, well, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then, with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over, at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel, instead of 26 for buying the oil.
Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance, or if we used it as hydrogen, which is more profitable and efficient, we'd get rid of the domestic oil too.
And for each car so financed, scrap almost one clunker, preferably the dirtiest ones.
And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes, so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air, they would waste more oil, and block the uptake of efficient, new planes.
And make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster.
Ours is on the demand side.
Why is that?
So David and I decided to go find out, through the best research we could muster, what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer, to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games.
These two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in PC Data -- entertainment titles in PC Data in December, right up there with "John Madden Football," which thrills me to death.
I'd like to play you some voices of little girls from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did -- actually, some of the voices are more recent.
Girl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery with clouds and flowers.
Let's hope it's really stable.
I mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night.
If we were playing the game, that's what we'd do.
We're not trying to tell them who they ought to be.
Goering was Hitler's second in command in World War II, his designated successor.
He painted a beautiful Vermeer.
He had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that.
Why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from?
So take food.
How do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk, but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk -- to think they taste better?
But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff, parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree.
Knowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido.
This was recorded in 1931.
So one answer was George Clooney.
I would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall.
I think this approach can explain differences in people's taste in art.
When this came out on television, the value of her art dropped to nothing.
Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell, you have to know you're listening to Joshua Bell.
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from iTunes.
The first shock is recorded as very painful.
The point was nicely summarized by the poet John Milton who wrote, "The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven."
The Q&amp;A session after a post-op presents data is often a blood bath.
This is somebody called Dr. Gillian McKeith Ph.D, or, to give her full medical title, Gillian McKeith.
Now that's not the only reason that we think this person is an idiot.
Actually, it turns out that your risk of breast cancer actually increases slightly with every amount of alcohol that you drink.
And what you find is, of course, people who eat veg and olive oil have fewer skin wrinkles.
And the claim was fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children.
So there's no control; there's no control group.
It's about the cultural meaning of a treatment.
And this is exactly what happened which antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia.
And yet, they always manage to to get the result that they want.
This is something called funnel plot.
So you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared.
I found no flaw.
But the companies withheld that data from them, and so did the European Medicines Agency for three years.
We cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information.
And I say, "Empathy.
And back in China, what do they say in China?
Can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there or a truck full of soldiers?
And so for the remainder of my talk, what I want you to do is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary Arab Muslim living in the Middle East -- in particular, in Iraq.
So here, let me help you.
You know why they have their eyes set on it?
This is Iraq.
It's part of your life.
You can't help but think that.
And they do wonderful things.
You pass it around. You pass his words around.
If they won't submit, kill them.
I mean, of course, this is how Americans take it, so people all over the Middle East, not just in your country, are protesting.
And they take these little kids and they run them through these things till they teach them how to say, "Sir, yes, sir," and things like grenade toss and weapons care and maintenance.
Isn't that interesting.
Of course, you got it wrong.
Okay, so now, here's what we're going to do.
It's an American, American soldiers, American woman who lost her loved one in the Middle East -- in Iraq or Afghanistan.
Can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks?
I'm going out to look out for us, the future of our country."
You're allowed to hate these people.
And suddenly, without realizing it, you're seeing the world differently.
We had the First World War, the Great Depression, the Second World War and the rise of the communist nations.
Today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons; it can be manned with a smaller crew; and unloaded faster than ever before.
Year after year after year, absolutely incredible.
As he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me."
The reason for this is incentives.
Larger markets increase the incentive to produce all kinds of ideas, whether it's software, whether it's a computer chip, whether it's a new design.
How else can we create new ideas?
That is a good thing.
Africa is coming on line.
Globalization is increasing the demand for ideas, the incentive to create new ideas.
That's not that far.
When I was writing up my notes oil was $140 per barrel.
So I'm optimistic so long as we hew to these two ideas: to keep globalizing world markets, keep extending cooperation across national boundaries, and keep investing in education.
After two days here, I declare myself boggled, and enormously impressed, and feel that you are one of the great hopes -- not just for American achievement in science and technology, but for the whole world.
As far back as I can remember, I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there.
At the extreme opposite end of the size scale, the class of marine bacteria, the Prochlorococci -- that will be on the final exam -- although discovered only in 1988, are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth, and moreover, responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean.
But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil, just a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there.
And that may be just the beginning!
Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations have been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms: true bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea, which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to.
The HIPPO juggernaut we have created, if unabated, is destined -- according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research -- to reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century.
We are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future.
What is the "Encyclopedia of Life?" A concept that has already taken hold and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously?
I wish you would help them.
This had been the most abundant bird in the world that'd been in North America for six million years.
By the end of the century, there was nothing left but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers.
It happened to lots of mammals.
It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos.
So this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome of an extinct species with the genome of its closest living relative.
Add them all up and the result won't be perfect.
De-extinction falls in that category.
The last bucardo was a female named Celia who was still alive, but then they captured her, they got a little bit of tissue from her ear, they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen, released her back into the wild, but a few months later, she was found dead under a fallen tree.
The most exciting thing for Bob Lanza is the ability now to take any kind of cell with induced pluripotent stem cells and turn it into germ cells, like sperm and eggs.
It does raise the question of, they're not going to have passenger pigeon parents to teach them how to be a passenger pigeon.
So basically, they're learning how to build on good news.
There were just 254 left.
They're going to work on the genomes of the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon.
I've got a question.
Well it feels like both the conversation and the potential here are pretty thrilling.
So two people who grew up in the Great Depression, there in the very, very early '80s took on a new kid.
I went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester, Massachusetts, and I had wonderful teachers there, most notably in first grade Mrs. Alisch.
When I was in the third grade, I wrote a book for the first time, "The Owl Who Thought He Was The Best Flyer."
Writing is using your imagination on paper, and I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids, that writing would be using your imagination on paper, if they're allowed to even write now within the school hours.
And I was so thrilled.
And we sat in silence for that brief moment, and he said to me, "You're really talented."
On the evening of my 14th birthday, I was given this table, and we had Chinese food.
I kept making comics, and at the Worcester Art Museum, I was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator I was ever given.
But it was around this time I went to Camp Sunshine to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids, kids with leukemia, and this kid Eric changed my life.
I would send out my books. I would send out hundreds of postcards to editors and art directors, but they would go unanswered.
"Dear Jarrett, I received your postcard.
My grandparents, they were in the middle of it.
So that photo, since that moment, is framed in front of me while I've worked on all of my books.
Thank you.
The sound around us is affecting us even though we're not conscious of it.
Noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years, and it affects not just the patients but also the people working there.
I am forced to ask myself a question.
Children are losing one word in two.
If education can be likened to watering a garden, which is a fair metaphor, sadly, much of the water is evaporating before it reaches the flowers, especially for some groups, for example, those with hearing impairment.
Noise goes up, heart rate goes up.
I just moderated a major conference in London a few weeks ago called Sound Education, which brought together top acousticians, government people, teachers, and so forth.
It's about designing, not appearance, but experience, so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look, that are fit for purpose, that improve our quality of life, our health and well being, our social behavior and our productivity.
Now, my brother and I, we're musicians and music producers.
Hundreds of musical segments are geo-tagged throughout the entire park so that as a listener traverses the landscape, a musical score is actually unfolding around them.
We're sometimes contacted by people in other parts of the world who can't travel to the United States, but would like to hear this record.
I love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective.
And I wanted to let my imagination run wild.
Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition, live, on stage.
It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal.
Being human is an art form.
There is a revolution.
Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry.
Hello. I would like to start my talk with actually two questions, and the first one is: How many people here actually eat pig meat?
And I followed this one pig with number "05049," all the way up until the end and to what products it's made of.
Then if you look around you in the bathroom, you see lots more products like shampoo, conditioner, anti-wrinkle cream, body lotion, but also toothpaste.
Of course, the bone in fine-bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength, in order to make these really fine shapes, like this deer.
And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops.
The low-tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve mounted in the high-tech bit, which is a memory metal casing.
Well it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source.
Some of those reforms have been good.
I have looked at the best and I've look at some of the worst.
He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things, like seeking first to understand as opposed to being understood, simple things like apologizing.
You were so excited, we just let you go."
And I gave them a saying to say: "I am somebody.
I put a "+2" on his paper and a big smiley face.
And you know your toughest kids are never absent.
But it is not impossible.
Now, this is one model of how language comes to be: namely, it's legislated by an academy.
It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted.
"Promise anything to her," "Promise her anything," and so on.
So, "give the X to the Y," that construction corresponds to the thought "cause X to go to Y." Whereas "give the Y the X" corresponds to the thought "cause Y to have X."
And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache, but it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head and causing it to go to the other person, and implanting it in them.
An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English are used not only literally, but in a quasi-metaphorical way.
And you might remember the scene in which the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer, is asked to show his driver's license and holds his wallet out with a 50-dollar bill extending at a slight angle out of the wallet.
So what's going on?
In less blatant cases, there's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on.
If you express your request as a conditional -- "if you could open the window, that would be great" -- even though the content is an imperative, the fact that you're not using the imperative voice means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance, where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person.
In that case, the consequences are rather severe.
And then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language, I think we can get a window onto what makes us tick.
Well, there's some other puzzles.
First, what do good arguers win when they win an argument?
Let's call this the rhetorical model, where you have to tailor your argument to the audience at hand.
It is the dominant way of thinking about arguments.
Think about that one. Have you ever entered an argument thinking, "Let's see if we can hash something out rather than fight it out. What can we work out together?"
And you give me your reasons.
What did you gain cognitively from convincing me?
We need to think of new kinds of arguments.
Think of all the roles that people play in arguments.
It takes practice to become a good arguer in the sense of being able to benefit from losing, but fortunately, I've had many, many colleagues who have been willing to step up and provide that practice for me.
So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater.
And then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins, or we have to dig them up.
And I said, well, in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization -- and then they all sort of leaned in -- they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization.
What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere; they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world.
So what can we learn about making -- not just computers, but everything?
And it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product. You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures; you use chemicals. OK. Heat, beat and treat.
Really quick syllabus.
On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough.
Down at the very base of it, there's fiber optics that work better than ours, actually, to move light, but you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible.
Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings, if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing.
The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog.
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book.
And he found a way to dry out vaccines -- encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells -- meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated.
Thank you.
And she's actually figuring out how to make a collision-avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust.
This is the simple design brief. I mean, it looks simple because the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out.
So if you're going to talk about jobs, then you have to talk about entrepreneurs.
I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from "The Apprentice."
I went on to Bosnia, and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official who said, "You know, Gayle, I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia, but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road.
But think about this.
And in many places, they're there.
Recently I was at the State Department in Washington and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana.
I think that is terrific.
So you see, this is not about doing good, this is about global growth and global employment.
The women in this room and watching in L.A.
Thank you very much.
But then one author arrived, and he changed the game forever.
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis.
And for the most part, the stories are recycled.
But can I use a paper towel?
Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge.
And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room.
Except for flooring.
But my elephant in the living room flies.
And it started, as with many great ideas, or many ideas you can't get rid of anyway, at a cocktail party.
But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion, and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living -- that are surviving.
Well, then let's build something that we can both benefit from, and find some way to make a new relationship with these species.
So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers.
You see, it wasn't working very well.
Their brains are proportionate, in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are.
Joshua Klein: Yeah, yeah. Pretty interesting.
The point being that they've developed cultural adaptation.
Basically, what happens is that we put this out in a field, or someplace where there's lots of crows, and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine.
Now, like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing, this really pisses them off.
Crows, on the other hand, show up, and they try and figure it out.
I think that crows can be trained to do other things.
So these four characters are going to be from that work that I've been doing for many years now, and well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people I've interviewed.
The Atlanta airport is a modern airport, and they should leave the gate there.
We read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course.
So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.
But there are certain other connotations to the word "risk," and the same thing about the word "nature." What is nature?
And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems, and this is called "A Mirror to Her Mouth."
I'm just talking about the particular night that she died.
And then he put her in the hallway.
I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went in and I put a mirror to her mouth -- there was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth.
So that's an investigation of the negative imagination.
I never saw any poor man, any black.
They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants.
They fought for their rights for over two centuries, and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities, Hispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream.
And I told you that in -- you know, I didn't give you the year, but in '79 I thought that I was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that, and I got sidetracked on race relations.
I think that's good luck.
I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way.
I mean, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like the last day I rodeo. I mean, I'll be alright.
All right, a political scientist, it doesn't really count, but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy that is Michigan, and, like any good scientist, I was experimenting with policy about what would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number.
It was in a big pavilion in Greenville, an indoor pavilion, and I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor that I couldn't stop the outflow of these jobs, and I wanted to grieve with them, and as I went into the room-- there's thousands of people there.
And that was asked not just by that guy but by everyone in the pavilion, and frankly, by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories that closed in the first decade of this century.
You might say Obamacare, except for those were not voluntary changes.
In fact, I was in China to see what they were doing, and they were putting on a dog-and-pony show for the group that I was with, and I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations and standing next to one of the Chinese officials, and we were watching, and he says, "So, Gov, when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy?"
You might take states like Iowa and Ohio -- two very important political states, by the way -- those two governors, and they would say, we're going to lead the nation in producing the wind turbines and the wind energy.
It's opt-in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina, who didn't opt into the education Race to the Top, you might even get them to opt in. Why?
What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors?
Let me connect the dots.
And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.
And even though that's still sort of creepy, there is an upside to having your taste monitored.
And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites, they truly dominate the social media space, which is a space that's having a huge impact on old media.
The future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data-driven, and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online, where women are really driving the action.
Can you even imagine what that looks like?
So check it, I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds.
I'll get the last time you lied.
And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage.
I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads, with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing, "Hush, little baby, don't say a word.
I'm going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting paper ever published in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.
People with spinal cord injuries, like paraplegias, quadriplegias, will often develop a very, very sensitive area right above the level of their injury, wherever that is.
It's so sad.
She said, "No. Honestly when I get home I'm usually too tired."
The dead guy, or gal, goes ... like that.
You know? You can get cadavers if you work at a university."
And this was one of those cases that went on and on.
They didn't buy it.
I have an answer for you. I have two answers.
Which I thought was an interesting idea, theory.
Now here we go in to the -- la la la, off to work.
Okay. Now I said -- when I was in Denmark, my host was named Anne Marie.
And I also said to her, "Now these sows. I mean, you may have noticed there, The sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy."
This did not stop Masters and Johnson.
Doctor Kinsey had heard -- and there was a theory kind of going around at the time, this being the 1940s -- that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility.
And that's actually where our story begins.
As the Trevor Project says, it gets better.
And believe me, I lived the same sad life until about three years ago.
As it turns out, there's a strong form and a weak form of this knot, and we were taught to tie the weak form.
Start as usual, go the other way around the loop.
I mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous because I'm speaking in a foreign language, and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.
So Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.
It's a picture by Paul Klee.
This is a picture by Joan Miro.
"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht Götz von Ohlenhusen wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich geschützt welche die Kunst durch spezifisch aufgeräumte Regelmässigkeiten des allgemeinen Formenschatzes neue Wirkungen zu erzielen möglich wird."
One, two, three.
It's called "Untitled" and I think that's appropriate.
In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.
So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.
OK, I mean, I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.
Or you could go into three-dimensional art.
And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.
I had to figure out what it is my dad did and why it was important.
That was a big deal; that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while; that was important.
Show everyone what you intend," is what he said.
"Ooh, what happened to that dude?
And moms grab their kids out of the way and say, "Don't stare!"
I mean, how important could you be then?" they said.
No! They're not for safety.
We may put him away for life, but we watch him clinically.
We're supposed to do things by design.
He would say, "You're right between horse and squirrel, John."
I mean, did a designer come up with that?
Hey, the name Ajax -- you can't get much more intentional than that, right?
Well, got that wrong, didn't we?
The given was replaced by various aspects of intent, by various designs, by various gods.
That won't do.
My machine: American-made, confident, sleek.
An object devoid of intent -- it's random, it's imitative, it repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away.
And she looked at me and said, "It's March 1st."
One year ago, I rented a car in Jerusalem to go find a man I'd never met but who had changed my life.
I didn't see Abed coming.
It was then I read the testimony that Abed gave the morning after the crash, of driving down the right lane of a highway toward Jerusalem.
I said I wanted to meet.
And so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived somewhere in his same town, and I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat, when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering.
The dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined.
I listened to her words. I suppose they were true.
He'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned.
It was this youth who on May 16, 1990, had broken two necks including mine, and bruised one brain and taken one life.
"I understand," I said, "that the crash was not your fault, but does it make you sad that others suffered?"
Some, as had Abed, would forget the date.
"Um, Abed," I said, "I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash."
With a nod to Jewish custom, he told me that I should live to be 120 years old.
I told him only that he had killed one man, not two.
The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber, and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen.
And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.
Those machines have no place for empathy.
You start to believe that it's alive and aware.
As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.
Now, any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more, but if you're anything like me, it won't.
Whether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works.
Now take this together and you end up with 2.3 million words of TEDTalks, which is about three Bibles-worth of content.
So if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words, you don't need more than six words for a TEDTalk.
The challenge here is, if I try to systematically do this, I would probably end up with a lot of summaries, but not with many friends in the end.
So for $60, I could summarize a thousand TEDTalks into just 600 summaries, which would actually be quite nice.
They used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if I'd been too much on Google lately.
It's a huge list.
But of course, once you are that far, you're not really satisfied.
Thank you very much.
Now let's fast-forward to the 1990s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing.
You see, we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing, pulls objects together.
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number.
It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely, at first you'll find molecules and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles.
But even though the dimensions are hidden, they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate.
The list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500.
In this context, the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy because there isn't just one number, there are many numbers.
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying.
But there's a little secret.
The different shapes yield different physical features.
I'll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future.
Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration.
Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion?
Thank you. Thank you, Brian.
So why don't we go over and have a look at the demo now.
So the problem we introduced to him was this: he's just moved house.
You can lean back, but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you're looking.
Do you want Milo to squash it?
We also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of Dimitri's voice, or the user's voice.
How do you skim stones?
Milo: Okay.
Milo's Mom: That carpet is brand new.
Milo: What do they want to come here for anyway?
Thanks.
She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party.
The siege went on for three and a half years, and it was a siege without water, without power, without electricity, without heat, without food, in the middle of Europe, in the middle of the 20th century.
Last April, I went back to a very strange -- what I called a deranged high school reunion.
They stay because you want to stay in your home.
Fifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women, which is fantastic, and there's also within the national constitution now, you're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi.
And I called him Luca, which means "The bringer of light," because he does bring light to my life.
He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it.
But my métier is to bear witness and that is the crux, the heart of the matter, for us reporters who do this.
This is a brain.
And Aurora liked to play video games.
Her brainstorms would control an arm that would move the cursor and cross the target.
By all purposes and means, Aurora's brain has incorporated that artificial device as an extension of her body.
And you truly liberate the brain now because you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar.
And the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward.
So that suggests to us that our sense of self does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies, but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we're commanding with our brains.
This is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously.
But I do hope to take you to some places you've never been to before.
They have a hut that has no electricity, no running water, no wristwatch, no bicycle.
We turned the money over to that man there, the principal of the school.
They built a new house, this time with running water, electricity, a bicycle, no pig.
In the 20th century, it was totalitarianism.
Well, you know this latter group, you're wrong.
What's remarkable is that her brothers, in the same family, were totally fine.
It's kind of like the dirty, little secret of poverty, which is that, not only do poor people take in very little income, but also, the income that they take in, they don't spend it very wisely, and unfortunately, most of that spending is done by men.
And that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders, which is a substantial portion.
You know, for every woman who does die, there are 20 who survive but end up with an injury.
The villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her.
She has become part of the solution, not the problem.
He was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable, therefore -- and took his frustrations out on her.
So now they're in it together.
Well, it just so happens, at that time, there was a group in Connecticut called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut.
She stayed at the top of her class through elementary school, middle school, and then in high school, she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village, ever, to come to the United States on scholarship.
So then, I ask, what's in it for you?
And then she came back to the United States and was on break, Christmas break.
Thank you very much.
Now language's subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship, in books you can't read, phrases you can't use and words you can't say.
Now these chimpanzees are using tools, and we take that as a sign of their intelligence.
Now this may sound arrogant, or even full of hubris.
And even this picture has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it -- something from a Barnum &amp; Bailey circus.
The chairs you're sitting in, the lights in this auditorium, my microphone, the iPads and iPods that you carry around with you -- all are a result of cumulative cultural adaptation.
The other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to cooperate amongst others.
Two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts, but they're hopeless at making the arrowheads.
We'll do that."
And so we prospered in a way that no other animal has.
If we go to the island of Papua New Guinea, we can find about 800 to 1,000 distinct human languages, different human languages, spoken on that island alone.
And they even slow the flow of genes.
And they impose a barrier to cooperation.
To put it this way, nature knows no other circumstance in which functionally equivalent traits coexist.
But that doesn't tell us they necessarily had language.
We've known about this problem for 50 years, depending on how you count it.
And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models.
And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation, and wind power, nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture, which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment, and work.
They will completely lose.
The result of that was pretty dramatic.
So you can't step on the brakes very quickly.
And to the person who was promoting it said, "The atmosphere's much more complicated."
There was all sorts of press coverage, all over the world, going right down to "Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth," from the Economist.
There are a lot of fun complexities that I'd love to spend the whole evening on, but I won't.
I'm sure there will be other problems that arise.
And the box has two knobs.
Even when they're doing it for other reasons.
So here's one way to think about it, which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper.
Because under this scenario, we walk further and further away from the current climate.
But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast, fast enough to put meters of sea level on the oceans in the next 100 years, and remove some of the biggest cities from the map.
I think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this, people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions.
Thank you very much.
It was a critical moment in American history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.
And a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text.
So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen, allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse, to simulate the loss of virginity.
This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA in Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.
They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations, and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability.
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film.
It's supposed to be a generic site of worship.
Now I'm going to move on to another project I did.
A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker.
Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder of a young girl walking to school.
He ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.
He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky.

So I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way to actually fill this gap.
But I was quickly told that, "Boy, our government doesn't really work like that."
And they actually shipped them here to Texas for us.
I would watch Nova on PBS.
We go from this view out to the stars.
Well, I can click on this home button over here, and that will take us up to the inner solar system, and now we're looking at the rest of the solar system.
So I'm just going to double-click on Vesta, and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta, and this is happening right now.
It doesn't look like anything's going on.
With a 3D visualization like this, we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn.
My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory.
In 1995, illegal drugs were a $400 billion business, representing eight percent of world trade, roughly the same as gas and oil.
For example, these two show great growth in income, absolutely flat happiness curves.
Especially expressions of contempt or disgust, well you really need a lot of positives to upset that.
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in, turn on, drop out thoughts, perceptions, feelings and memories.
So when people's symptoms go away, they tend to recur, because there isn't a sense of the other half -- of what pleasure, happiness, compassion, gratitude, what are the positive emotions.
We are very sensitive to the negative, but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity.
Let's just go into the brain for a moment, and see where does happiness arise from in evolution.
It's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye, the orbicularis oculi.
And we imitate from almost the second we are born.
These are not the periods when you feel happiest.
And that's dopamine-fed. And that's, "I must have this one person."
And that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status so that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy as they are in the animal world.
"Do you think the less-fortunate are having better sex?"
They went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control to generosity and forgiveness.
As a child, I had two passions.
You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right.
Rats have been used since the '50s last century, in all kinds of experiments.
It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.
They have a skill, which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid.
Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked, there is a huge common problem.
This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology.
Just as an indication, whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day, a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only.
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.
It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings: How does this all come about?
Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain.
Because it's as though this neuron is adopting the other person's point of view.
Now, let's look at culture, the phenomenon of human culture.
A human being, a child, can just watch its parent kill another polar bear, and skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body, and learn it in one step. What the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn, it can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes.
So, here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy.
All that's separating you from him, from the other person, is your skin.
Now the astonishing thing is, if you have pain in your phantom limb, you squeeze the other person's hand, massage the other person's hand, that relieves the pain in your phantom hand, almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged.
What makes us who we are anyway?
YR: This year, I am 32 years old, the same age Bruce Lee was when he died.
I even started to get discounts in Indian shops.
When I had learned this phrase, I had an artist over there hear me out to see how accurate it sounded.
Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee, I become more authentically me.
Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers.
The little hole in the middle, we'll come to a bit later, but that's for the pollen tube to come out later on. A very tiny tube.
My story is actually not about plant propagation, but about pollen itself.
And I'm rather proud to say that this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago London was full of mangroves.
Pollen is tiny. It gets on to things, and it sticks to them.
It's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made, where banknotes have come from, to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did.
So this is the leading killer of women.
So it's a woman's disease now.
We need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis.
And then physicians have gone to bat.
She had to impersonate a man.
It's informed us about osteoporosis.
And our colleagues in Washington, D.C.
Some women have those heart attacks, but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack, where it erodes, doesn't completely fill with clot, symptoms are subtle, EKG findings are different -- female-pattern.
All over.
And if you did that angiogram, which is the red, you can see the man's disease.
We're doing this at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in the Women's Heart Center.
So we're very excited about M.R.
And that is female-pattern and why we think the Yentl syndrome actually is explaining a lot of these gaps.
Now are we happy with this?
Too many lives are at stake.
Women's health, from a federal funding standpoint, sometimes it's popular, sometimes it's not so popular.
We plate them into dishes that we sometimes call petri dishes.
And so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive.
In the lab, we micro-pattern channels in the biomaterials on which we grow the cells, and this allows us to flow the cell culture media, the cells' food, through the scaffolds where we're growing the cells -- a lot like what you might expect from a capillary bed in the heart.
But what's really amazing is that the cells, when we electrically stimulate them, like with a pacemaker, that they beat so much more.
Behind every sound, sight, touch, taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us.
But there's also a scientific reason that drove this project, which was to use this natural longitudinal data to understand the process of how a child learns language -- that child being my son.
My son, soon after his first birthday, would say "gaga" to mean water.
And so we started to analyze why.
And the implications of this -- there are many, but one I just want to point out, is that there must be amazing feedback loops.
What I'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes, again, of just life in the living room.
What we'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they're learned -- so in other words, the relationship between words and what they're about in the world.
And what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape.
This has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space.
So we have the programs and the sporting events and the commercials, and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph.
They talk to other people.
And of course, through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language.
And just as I was having that thought, he looked up at me and said, "So that when I grow up, I can show this to my kids?"
And so let's fly back in time to that memorable moment.
And the Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches that were made by two visual artists.
Light enters, hits the back of the retina, and is circulated, most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain, at the primary visual cortex.
So that's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something.
So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning.
So the low-tech version looks like this.
But instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on.
And I believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today. Thanks so much.
Right there -- those are hickory nuts.
Then, looking up in the turret, you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth.
After all, it's not just a question of hygiene, but there's a possibility of recreation as well.
We don't know of any other house," and so forth and so on.
Put it in the shower, or in the closet, but not in the foyer.
Oh, that's a cell phone.
Let's take it out. Throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in."
If I can repeat anything, I have the possibility of a pattern from hickory nuts and chicken eggs, shards of glass, branches.
Predicated on plumb level, square and centered.
The third thing is arguably -- the Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance with the rise of humanism, then got a little jump-start along about the French Revolution.
Well I feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern, and it's from a Dionysian perspective.
"Oh, just looking for some header material," waiting for that kudos.
Are we just being numbingly stupid?
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it.
And we get sucked into that faster than anything.
Now what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how I should live my life.
Human beings are a social species.
You're not one of the beautiful people.
We can't even afford to eat anything except beans.
What don't you do this, and why don't you do that?"
This is Los Angeles, California, where I live.
Fifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest.
The show began with tremendous special effects, because there were catastrophic climate shifts -- which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.
So watching all of this show from outer space, you think we get it, we understand that the most precious resource on the blue planet is our consciousness.
Each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation, which means that India, unless something changes, is accumulating a need for millennia of rehabilitation.
If I talk about migraine, 40 percent of the population suffer episodic headaches.
This is how I was when I returned from the hospital after nearly four months.
But the system has moved me on because, as my family started to discover, there is no long-term concept in the health care system.
Let's just talk about full-scale I.Q.
Then I underwent cognitive training.
Here's somebody, what they did as they went through cognitive training at ages seven and 11.
Up to 30 percent of the population have a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jaw that affects the entire body.
I still had migraine headaches.
Using this technology, the specialists at UCLA Medical Center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring.
It weighs less than a gram.
And other FM devices implanted in fingertips, on contacting a surface, will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain, so that the person feels a sense of touch.
And he was walking around.
And if I do this, probably the mic won't hear it.
But this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time.
I should clarify that.
Thank you. Thank you.
I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute -- that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there.
So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here: number of children per woman: one, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman.
It's China there, moving against better health there, improving there.
This is OECD. The rich country. The country club of the U.N.
In some countries, 99.7 percent of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70. And here it seems there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.
This is Mao Tse-tung. He brought health to China. And then he died.
You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population.
And even more policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. Now, why doesn't this take place?
We are liberating U.N. data, some few U.N. organization.
He only says, "We can't do it."

But I should say that my background -- my father was, you know, raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican, but after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat.
And Schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes, and it had to be present on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before.
So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well, maybe I could become a biochemist, but I discovered biochemistry was very boring.
So I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher, and I ended up in Cambridge, England.
This is a photograph several years later, when Bragg had cause to smile.
And so we didn't build any models, and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins.
But about, oh, 15 months after I got to Cambridge, a rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son, who was in Cambridge, that his father was now working on DNA.
Well, we got the answer on the 28th February '53.
So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours.
They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right.
But there is what we did when we didn't know where to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club.
And we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA.
And, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And, but we were still a long ways from, you know, answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood, which is: How do you nature-nurture?
And now I have a sort of vested interest: I want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know, you aren't treated if it's not dangerous.
So a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of DNA.
And if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.
Now my company, Fark, deals with news, ostensibly, and as a result we were not in violation of this patent.
It would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company, especially a small eight-man shop like my company.
We didn't have high hopes for that outcome.
Now what did I learn from this case? Well, three things.
Don't forget that.
And these goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposed, but they are at odds.
"Lucky for you he calls at all," said Jasmine.
"Because he's in jail," she bravely admitted.
Because that's what they called them.
It was beautiful.
I know that very well, because I was one of the lucky girls.
Now I bet, in this audience, you're thinking of some really incredible technology, some stuff that I haven't even heard of, I'm absolutely sure.
And it was because of scenes like this.
As you can see, the virus stopped, and it stopped very, very fast.
It's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease, and it's got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic.
This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary.
The risks are massive, but the pay-off -- economic, humanitarian, motivational -- it's absolutely huge.
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat, and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it's not potent; it's not going to protect them.
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple.
This is a group whose million-strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years.
It's been working to help control pandemic flu, SARS for example.
We should abandon this idea of eradication.
His right leg was paralyzed in 2004.
And this started an incredible collaboration with industry, and within six months, we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted, just two years ago, the last two types of polio in the world.
Now remember, northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio.
And as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus, it's a stark reminder that we are failing, as a society, to reach children with the most basic of services.
We have a new vaccine, we have new resolve, and we have new tactics.
But the interesting thing is, of those three, India's looking real good, as you just saw in the data.
We spend right now about 750 million to 800 million dollars a year.

And the minute we found this leopard, we realized that we needed to move in, and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four-and-a-half years -- following her every day, getting to know her, that individual personality of hers, and really coming to know her.
But also, our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time, because we're driving through water, and it's an unknown territory.
We drowned our pride, I must tell you, which was really serious, and we seized the engine.
He's focused on this hyena, and he is going to get it.
I had tears rolling down my cheeks.
And for us, in many ways, this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us, a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.
So we knew we had to react quickly.
But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with Legadema.
BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together.
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.
DJ: So what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential.
That is, if we don't take action and do something, these plains will be completely devoid of big cats, and then, in turn, everything else will disappear.
Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories -- experimental predictions -- to specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy.
The number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater than the number of glassfuls, or bladdersful, in the world -- and, of course, there's nothing special about Cromwell or bladders. You have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree.
Science has taught us, against all intuition, that apparently solid things, like crystals and rocks, are really almost entirely composed of empty space.
He stared at his wall in Arlington, Virginia, and decided to do it.
I have every reason to think it's true; I was reading Playboy because I, myself, had an article in it.
Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place. Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you.
A monkey's brain must have software capable of simulating a three-dimensional world of branches and trunks.
Dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids, extremely diluted: caprylic acid and caproic acid.
Miracles are just events that are extremely improbable.
Could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability, which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at.
And, similarly, a relativistic computer game in which objects on the screen manifest the Lorenz Contraction, and so on, to try to get ourselves into the way of thinking -- get children into the way of thinking about it.
Treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate, but it's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next.
I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis.
I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage, and we formed the Robots for Humanity project.
Your disability doesn't make you any less of a person, and neither does mine.
One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop.
All right, big finish.
One hundred years ago, I would have been treated like a vegetable.
Everything gives out some kind of data, whether it's sound or smell or vibration.
What we can see here is the metal sheet, this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator.
And hopefully in the future we'll be able to gain some deeper understanding of how they communicate.
And here is some eye candy for you, from a range of DIY scientists and artists from all over the globe.
Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism.
I'm an American, which means, generally, I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno's size running into each other at extremely high speeds.
In fact, I'll let them tell you a bit more about it.
Now, most of you have figured out that this was a prank, and actually a very, very good one.
So as long as activism is that simple, it's pretty easy to get away with.
It's also extremely surprising to many Americans, a heavily African-American space.
And what's crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter, it's literally a quick click away.
It's actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fijian feature film.
It includes things like the Internet cables.
but look at this map, and you can watch this for, you know, two or three minutes.
If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s, 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast.
When you look at the New York Times, you look at other elite media, what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we've invaded.
So all of this starts leading me to think that we're in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism.
This is a team of bloggers from around the world.
One of those dark spots is Madagascar, a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there.
They translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers, major websites.
And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for.
Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other, she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East.
And you can listen to her as well, if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened.
He is a bridge figure.
It's called "Dhani Tackles the Globe."
My guess -- given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal -- is that most of you are xenophiles, whether or not you use that term.

Do we find a flourishing civil society, a vigorous rule of law and good security? No. What we find in Afghanistan is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt, a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective, a media which is beginning to get onto its feet but a government that's deeply unpopular, perceived as being deeply corrupt, and security that is shocking, security that's terrible.
What is wrong with the people that we have chosen?
The point about democracy is not instrumental.
After I speak to you today, I'm going on a radio program called "Any Questions," and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never, ever say that they don't know the answer to a question. It doesn't matter what it is.
But for any of these things to work, the honesty in language, the local democracy, it's not just a question of what politicians do.
And it's not completely gratuitous, because wok and roll -- Chinese food and Japanese foods, so it kind of works out.
Fortune cookie.
If you see them side by side, there's yellow and brown.
I guarantee you, General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life -- and indeed, that actually was a picture of General Tso.
Because it doesn't look like Chinese food to them.
You know, back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan: if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl, you could take her out on a chop suey date.
And not the most PC question to be asked today, but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time, not so outlandish.
And the way that he tells it, there was a guy, there was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up, and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.
My downstairs neighbor, Alessandra, was completely shocked when I told her, "Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."
And then -- one thing: they have things like risotto chop suey.
So whatever it was, it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way.
And the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggetfying them, because that's kind of an easy concept, but the trick behind Chicken McNuggets was, they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-effective manner, which is why it took so long for other people to copy them.
And in Philadelphia, you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll, which looks like an egg roll on the outside, but a cheesesteak on the inside.
You know, ever since man had any notion that some of his other people, his colleagues, could be different, could be strange, could be severely depressed or what we now recognize as schizophrenia, he was certain that this kind of illness had to come from evil spirits getting into the body.
Well, along comes Benjamin Franklin, and he comes close to convulsing himself with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite.
So they found this "cagoots" guy, a 39-year-old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic, who was known, had been known for months, to be literally defecating on himself, talking nothing that made any sense, and they brought him into the hospital.
He relapsed a little bit, they gave him a series of treatments, and he was essentially cured.
Well, you know, in the middle '60s, the first antidepressants came out. Tofranil was the first.
It was dreadful.
I could hardly see five feet in front of myself.
Nothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things.
Well, as in all hospitals, there was a resident assigned to my case. He was 27 years old, and he would meet with me two or three times a week.
And you know why they agreed? They agreed to humor him.
By 18 and 19, I was sleeping through the night.
It was, "Ah, fuck it!"
Went right back into the university and began to write books.
One might think reading these books -- and I've gotten thousands of letters about them by people who do think this -- that based on my life's history as I've portrayed in the books, my early life's history, I am someone who has overcome adversity.
I'm thrilled to be here.
In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent.
So the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material.
But I mentioned that the film is also technological.
So as you see the film go in transparently through there, and then ...
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light, and so we've made optical fibers.
And so you have here a little example of a small skull -- what we call mini Yorick.
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted.
And so what you see there is the difference.
So if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society, maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the dramatic arts.
We've got the robot -- in his head is a database of a lot of jokes.
If you like what's going on, show the green.
You guys are looking good out there.
Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss.
He gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead.
But to be completely honest with you, I kind of love television.
Stick with people like you."
The question isn't whether or not I know you.
Now, 20th-century psychologists and sociologists were thinking about strangers, but they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations, and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices.
And we concluded a very important insight, which was that as people's relationships to the things in their lives change, so do their relations with other people.
Strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that I need right now, that enables me to find the sources of intimacy, of discovery, and of inspiration that I need right now.
How might we think differently about our relations with technologies, things that effectively become social participants in their own right?
Here is my father at age 19.
And, of course, he never talked about his past life when he was a forger.
One day, while my father was working on a file for us to obtain French nationality, I happened to see some documents that caught my attention.
I had become a mother and he was celebrating his 77th birthday, and suddenly I was very, very afraid.
That's where he discovered something totally magical, and when he talks about it, it's fascinating -- it's the magic of dyeing chemistry.
My father had been instilled with such respect for the law that although he was being persecuted, he'd never thought of false papers.
And actually, without knowing it, my father had invented something we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case: the so-called "correction pen."
Anyway, he had to do all this because he was completely obsessed with output.
He was broke all of the time.
He'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call.
There, just once, it happened in May of 1968.
I asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make, he ever had any regrets.
We're the first generation -- thanks to science -- to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability of planet Earth to support human development as we know it.
Here, used as a proxy, temperature variability.
The majority of the planet, aspiring for development, having the right for development, are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle, a momentous pressure.
You can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well-being -- nitrous oxide, methane, deforestation, overfishing land degredation, loss of species -- they all show the same pattern over the past 200 years.
The Arctic -- a beautiful system -- a regulating biome at the planetary level, taking the knock after knock on climate change, appearing to be in a good state.
Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation where we're coming too close to thresholds that could lead to deleterious and very undesired, if now catastrophic, change for human development?
The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point, the pre-industrial point, where we're very safely in the safe operating space.
In fact, there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change, that we have the ability to now move into a new innovative, a transformative gear, across scales.
There's good news here, for example, from Latin America, where plow-based farming systems of the '50s and '60s led farming basically to a dead-end, with lower and lower yields, degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in Paraguay, Uruguay and a number of countries, Brazil, leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies, which today, for example, in some countries, have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch, zero till farming which, not only produces more food, but also sequesters carbon.
We need nothing less than a new green revolution, and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink.
Everybody talks about carbon taxes -- it won't work -- emission schemes, but for example, one policy measure, feed-in tariffs on the energy system, which is already applied, from China doing it on offshore wind systems, all the way to the U.S.
They sort of say the harsh news, that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization.
See, for instance, in this picture.
You couldn't really say what you wanted to say; you had to invent ways of doing it.
But I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice.
A Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it.
But now I wanted to work in a very low-tech way, so something that would mean at the same time a lump of cotton, a cloud and Durer's praying hands -- although this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands.
And it's totally overkill.
And the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings.
I got some photographs from them.
So they're called "Pictures of Chocolate."
This is Richard Serra.
This is like you see -- the size of a person over there.
Actually, I once paid like 60 dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of "King Lear," and I felt really robbed, because by the time the actor started being King Lear, he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see.
But before doing that, I just briefly want to remind you about what you already know: that our genomes, our genetic material, are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes in the form of DNA, which is this famous double-helical molecule.
And generally we depict our ideas about this history in the form of trees like this.
And what you can then also begin to do is to say, "How are these genetic differences distributed across the world?"
So what I often like to say is that, from a genomic perspective, we are all Africans.
And it's a lot: 38 million variable positions.
And only for 12 positions can we hope to be 95 percent right.
And the way to ask that question is to look at the Neanderthal that comes from Southern Europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today.
This may also be surprising because the Neanderthals were never in China.
So this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with Neanderthals, but far back and then have a long independent history.
They meet Neanderthals, mix with them, continue to spread over the world, and somewhere in Southeast Asia, they meet Denisovans and mix with them and continue on out into the Pacific.
Thank you for your attention.
So this is our largest airplane which we have, the Airbus A380, and it's quite huge, so a lot of people fit in there and it's technically completely different than the vision I've shown to you.
So what we need is space inside the aircraft, inside a very dense area.
My belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness.
And this is combined with a top-down approach, because what we are doing in our daily life is we train our muscles, we train our skeleton, and it's getting stronger.
We have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf.
It's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves, to understand the world around them, is shaped by that stance.
Well, now we know that autism is this disruption, the disruption of this resonance that I am telling you.
And it's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind, the social mind, the social brain, depends on.
Imagine if I did that to you, and I came two inches from your face.
Well, a few minutes later, she goes to the corner of the room, and she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&amp;M.
We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism.
There are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism. In fact, we believe that there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism, and genetic anomalies, much more than just genes.
Is she thinking about me? Is she thinking about others?"
In this scan pass, in green here, are two-year-olds with autism.
It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months.
If we measured things that are, evolutionarily, highly conserved, and developmentally very early emerging, things that are online from the first weeks of life, we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months, and that's what we are doing now.
That's not the idea.
It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done since I became a paratrooper 27 years before.
And you wait a little bit longer, because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait.
So nice air comes flowing in.
If you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute -- you've got a whole new problem set.
And then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line, so that it's not on you when you land, and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall.
And I realized that, if they had to go into combat, they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders.
And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership.
We move forward, and we get wiped out -- I mean, wiped out immediately.
First, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with: the environment changed -- the speed, the scrutiny, the sensitivity of everything now is so fast, sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it.
An emerging opportunity came -- didn't have time to get everybody together.
So how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven't done what the people you're leading are doing?
And I said, "John, where's your son? And how is he?"
I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment.
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing.
And it isn't always fair.
My overall project is about art -- specifically, about black artists -- very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves.
One of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with idea of how powerful images can be and people's understanding of themselves and each other.
It's always what it was and what it can be.
This series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now, at this point in history, to see art as a catalyst; what it means now, at this point in history, as we define and redefine culture, black culture specifically in my case, but culture generally.
It is why I look to art.
And as many of us think about that continent and think about what if means to us all in the 21st century, I have begun that looking through artists, through artworks, and imagining what they can tell us about the future, what they tell us about our future, and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue.
Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003, and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there, right now and on the near horizon.
Moreover, I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success.
We know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand the impact of their actions.
Last year, hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for some of the developing world's worst diseases: African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.
In Kenya, mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency.
In the best Worldchanging tradition, it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas, successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility.
Now, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about, but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this: the online part of the Earth Witness project would be created by the users, working together and working openly.
Now, all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis.
And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption, every little bit of information matters.
We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much.
After this, we noticed a couple of interesting things, which you'll see.
I gave them a computer with a speech-to-text interface, which you now get free with Windows, and asked them to speak into it.
After that, I started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own.
As a result, the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their English -- rapid improvement and all sorts of things.
The first experiment I did out of Newcastle was actually done in India.
They said, "Yes, we did."
And then that's her over there.
I said, "No, use the method of the grandmother."
I made them into groups of four.
The first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes.
A single child in front of a single computer will not do that.
They wanted to be footballers before.
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students.
There was silence for a while, then they said, "You've spelled it wrong.
Which is why you react the way you do, because it looks impossible.
And when I'm in the turbulent times, as we know, that I am right now, through the crucible and the fire of transformation, which is what all of you do, actually.
And these 20 old men who I'd seen before all of a sudden stood up in these full warrior costumes with the headdress and the spears, and no one was in the square, and I was hidden in the shadows.
The next moment, as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows, a young man with a propane lantern came on, hung it up on a tree, set up a curtain.
An ideograph is like a brush painting, a Japanese brush painting.
But the beauty of it is that it's just silk and sticks.
It's a movie. I did "The Tempest" on a stage three times in the theater since 1984, '86, and I love the play.
Ferdinand: Beyond all limit.
Sebastian: Draw thy sword.
What, if I were to boil it down, would be the one image that I could hang my hat on for this?
Now the difference when I went and did it in the cinema, I started the actual movie with a close-up of a sand castle, a black sand castle, and what cinema can do is, by using camera, perspective, and also long shots and close-ups, it started on a close-up of the sand castle, and as it pulled away, you saw that it was a miniature sitting in the palm of the girl's hands.
JT: If I give enough movement in the sculpture, and the actor moves their head, you feel like it's alive.
But it's very easy to climb up, is it not?
I know you understand that.
The other thing about Formula 1 in particular is we're always changing the car.
So during a two-hour race, each car will be sending 750 million numbers.
It was deemed to be an unpredictable event.
Now, when you look at some of the data on the screen above, things like heart rate, pulse, oxygen, respiration rates, they're all unusual for a normal child, but they're quite normal for the child there, and so one of the challenges you have in health care is, how can I look at the patient in front of me, have something which is specific for her, and be able to detect when things start to change, when things start to deteriorate?
The lines on the bottom, the blue and the red, these are the interesting ones.
It is displaying data that exists already in a different way, to amplify it, to provide cues to the doctors, to the nurses, so they can see what's happening.
I really am honored to be here, and as Chris said, it's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa.
And I said, "Well, what color do you want to paint it?" And they said, "Well, you choose." And I said, "No, no, I'm learning to listen.
And the women said, "It really is."
But as human beings, we also want to see each other, and we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.
It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations, and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans in both for-profit and nonprofit entities that deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water to low income people in South Asia and Africa, so that they can make their own choices.
It's indigenous to China and the Far East, but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa, Patrick and his colleagues said, "Let's bring it here, because it's a high value-add product."
And even when we explained that if ABE goes away, all those 7,500 jobs go away too, we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.
And this is really a story about a public-private solution that has really worked.
In our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003.
We can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero, or we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net, costing the public sector another six dollars a net, give the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system that might, over time, start sustaining itself.
One sister who makes other people's wishes come true.
I'm going to be talking a little bit about music, machines and life.
A fantastically viral and wonderful video.
The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it, then we couldn't use it in the video.
So the machine would get started, it would travel some distance, reacting along the way, hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback.
The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions.
And we learned that small stuff stinks.
So you put that up front so that, if it fails, at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing.
What are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what!
Hello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go, and this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass."
One that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, so we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo, since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci.
I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me, but basically to do what? Well, to assess, for example, the state of conservation. See here the face of the Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it you suddenly see another, different lady, aged lady, I should rather say.
They're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work.
So all we need is one finger. Just wipe off and we see the elephant.
I'd like to show you a video of some of the models I work with.
So without the controversy, that's cool thing number one.
So with disease models like these, we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before, and maybe discover drugs even faster.
These systems are really hard to build, but we're just starting to be able to get there, and so, watch out.
Thank you.
Certainly, 10,000 years ago, the civilization's beginning, the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now.
Good business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. -- they all deal with human bodies, which require being fed, transported, housed and so on. And the information technology, which connects to our brains, has no limit -- now, that is a wonderful field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity?
Your great-great grandparents got by on muscle power, and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc.
A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance -- in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.
For those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home.
Can you bring up the house lights?
Thank you very much. Thank you.
It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually.
Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile. Suddenly, we humans -- a recently arrived species, no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature -- have grown in population, technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.
And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be -- desirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age -- I think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning, not a forecast. That was before -- I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions of hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder seriously -- was this more of a forecast than I wanted?
And when it comes down -- and we'll see how it goes.
It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer from Sydney, Australia, to be here on the TED stage literally on the other side of the world.
Now what Steven was saying was, "Look, Adam, you are at a critical juncture in your life here, my friend.
The universe "is written in the mathematical language."
We know there are an infinite number of primes due to the brilliant mathematician Euclid.
31 is a prime number, and that five in the power is also a prime number.
In the 1700s, other mathematicians said he is simply the master of us all.
But one of the great things about the search for massive primes, it's not just finding the primes.
He took away one and wrote that number on the board.
This is the largest prime number we knew in 1996, a very emotional year for me.
They found another megaprime."
Here's a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime.
It's got a remarkably clear yes/no answer, and just requires phenomenal grunt.
You think that's cool.
I was there. It was the most emotional, exciting day.
And he postulated a suggestion that there's this infinite, incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe, and as other particles go through those particles and interact, that's where they get their mass.
Thank you.
And despite their ferocious appearance, Tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals.
And yet, she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils in her pouch.
Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year.
An amazing fact is that, given the right environment and the right nutrients, a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever.
So I took this opportunity to collect some samples from Jonas' tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body.
Think about that for a minute.
But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils, why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans?
But this dog cancer is quite remarkable, because it spread all around the world.
Ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else.
Take marriage for example.
And I just want to make it absolutely clear that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias, because he is in fact uniquely talented.
So I'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics, and I want you to think for each of these abilities where you stand relative to the rest of the population.
And finally, how modest are you?
Some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations.
Next time they will do better.
Now they weren't willing to wait a year or 10 years; no one wants an aging celebrity.
We know that, because when you ask people about their ultimate favorite day of the week, surprise, surprise, Saturday comes in at first, then Friday, then Sunday.
But the question that was really confusing to me was, how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality?
And indeed they did -- but mostly when the information we gave them was better than what they expected.
Yes, smoking kills, but mostly it kills the other guy.
On the other side of the brain, the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news.
After that everything goes back to normal, I assure you.
Well I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias, which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life.
So what we would really like to do, is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism, but at the same time remain hopeful, benefiting from the many fruits of optimism.
Because to make any kind of progress, we need to be able to imagine a different reality, and then we need to believe that that reality is possible.
Now that's a big abstract number.
And what that means is not that the age of the State is over.
You might think of that as the privatization of war.
For example, the great Oxford historian who taught here at this university, A.J.P. Taylor, defined a great power as a country able to prevail in war.
And president Medvedev of Russia, for example, pronounced in 2008 this was the beginning of the end of United States power.
Goldman Sachs has projected that China, the Chinese economy, will surpass that of the U.S.
The second thing is that the Chinese economy passes the U.S. economy in, let's say, 2030, which it may it, that will be a measure of total economic size, but not of per capita income -- won't tell you about the composition of the economy.
It's as though Mexico and Canada were hostile neighbors to the United States, which they're not.
To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt from a different context, the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself.
There are balancers -- the U.S., Europe, China, Japan can balance each other.
So as we think about power in this century, we want to get away from this view that it's all I win, you lose.
In that sense, if we define our interests, for example, for the United States the way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century, keeping an open trading system, keeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas -- those were good for Britain, they were good for others as well.
I'm going to talk about post-conflict recovery and how we might do post-conflict recovery better.
So get peacekeepers there, but get them home as soon as possible.
And the risks stay high throughout the decade.
Because after years of stagnation and decline, the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game.
Typically in the past, the donors have been interested in the first couple of years, and then they got bored.
Why? Because during conflict economic policy typically deteriorates.
If you don't get the policy reform and the aid, you don't get the economic recovery, which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers.
And indeed, unfortunately, if you navigate by needs you get a very unfocused agenda, because in these situations, needs are everywhere, but the capacity to implement change is very limited.
And why are jobs so important?
In fact, you're building a long-term liability by inflating civil service.
And so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks in expanding the construction sector.
Let me turn from jobs to the second objective, which is improving basic social services.
So, jobs, basic services, finally, clean government.
So that's the -- let me wrap up, this is the package.
This is the skyline of my hometown, New Orleans.
This talk is about being prepared for, and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home, the Earth.
That's the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice.
Their March electricity bill was only 48 dollars.
Second, preparing for heat and drought.
Washington, D.C., last year, actually led the nation in new green roofs installed, and they're funding this in part thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags.
New York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms, as you can see from this clever sign, and to sea level rise, and to storm surge, as you can see from the subway flooding.
The larger point I'm trying to make is this.
Okay, religious mania: there's rapture, there's weeping, there's visions.
S: I don't want to let my parents down.
If you are a Chinese student you start learning English in the third grade, by law.
Teacher: Perfect! Students: Perfect!
Your native language is your life.
We are going to take a quick voyage over the cognitive history of the 20th century, because during that century, our minds have altered dramatically.
And initially, that archaeologist would be baffled.
Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews.
One's a fish.
A third interview was conducted with someone about the North Pole.
How can we address them?"
They were things like, what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states that existed at that time?
Well, in 1900, three percent of Americans practiced professions that were cognitively demanding.
They went far beyond that 1900 banker.
Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning -- -- that turned black?
Would you deserve to be killed?
You're treating them as universals, to be rendered consistent by logic.
They would say wolves.
We've noticed, in a trend among young Americans, that they read less history and less literature and less material about foreign lands, and they're essentially ahistorical.
Lord Curzon once said he saw people bathing in the North Sea, and he said, "Why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have?"
I'm a public school teacher, and I just want to share a story of my superintendent.
And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table, I began to call it the wisdom table.
And I said, "What do I do?"
Chris, could you stand up and let them see you -- a young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film.
What I saw was my teachers coming through me.
You know that teacher?
And so that gesture of my mother's continues through many generations.
I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies.
And each country has a cabinet.
And so with all these crises, we have -- let's see -- ethnic and minority tensions; we have chemical and nuclear spills, nuclear proliferation.
John Hunter: I offered them a -- Actually, I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer.
It's a serious question: who is really in charge?
And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up.
But come to find out, a few game days later -- and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team -- actually there's a negotiation period with all teams, and each team takes a turn, then we go back in negotiation, around and around, so each turn around is one game day.
If you're a military commander and you wage troops -- the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them, I put in a letter.
By the third sentence, she was in tears.
One week he said, "Those who go into battle and win will want to go back, and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win."
This is about my friend Brennan.
Principal walks in, I'm out of a job.
And the game is won.
And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I'm standing, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the National Movement.
Well I took one year.
This is called a cycle valve tube.
You give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram.
Because triangles are the only rigid structures.
If you, as a matter of fact, put four marbles inside, you simulate the molecular structure of methane, CH4.
So all you do is -- it's a very kind of provocative statement -- this old bicycle tube and this old plastic [unclear] This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube.
If you spin something, it tends to fly out.
But this is great fun for children.
And this is a hundred-year-old toy.
And this is what Newton talked about 400 years back, that white light's made of seven colors, just by spinning this around.
If you have a battery, it costs five cents to make it.
And this science is not a rich man's game.
This is a touching slate meant for blind children.
But this has come as a great boon for them.
Lines, of course, would be cut, the force will be generated.
When first you see Nehru and Gandhi, this is the Nehru cap -- just half a newspaper.
And there were lots of passengers on the ship, and they were getting bored, so the captain invited them on the deck.
And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship.
And the ship sinks, and the captain has lost everything, but for a life jacket.
That's roughly 10,000 times the range of man-made fire detectors.
So we started exploring this material called ETFE.
So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency -- delivering the same function, but with a fraction of the resource input.
And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste.
And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time, there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing.
And just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London, which at the moment is a complete eyesore.
And if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts, there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity.
So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air, it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.
So we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits.
And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages.
So it should be possible to extract valuable elements like lithium for high-performance batteries.
Far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language.
So I asked everybody in my life what they thought.
If my strategy was to least-expect my way into true love, then the variable that I had to deal with was serendipity.
So that basically meant there were 35 men for me that I could possibly date in the entire city of Philadelphia.
And the matchmaker would sort of think through all of this, put two people together, and that would be the end of it.
I talked a lot about JavaScript.
I'm going to shove it into my bag, and I'm going to have this email template, and I'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically, these dates really are terrible.
The other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like, are you a dog person or a cat person?
I wanted somebody was Jew...ish, so I was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture, but wasn't going to force me to go to shul every Friday and Saturday.
So once I had all this done, I then built a scoring system, because what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not I thought the guy that I found online would be a match with me.
There was only one problem: He didn't like me back.
Now, before I lose all of you -- -- understand that I did this strictly to gather data about everybody else in the system.
What I was trying to get at here was that I figured in person, I would be just as competitive as a SmileyGirl1978.
And what I realized was not that I had to dumb down my own profile.
Well, not too long after that, I found this guy, Thevenin, and he said that he was culturally Jewish, he said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter, which I thought was very clever.
It's just not the ones that we're being presented with online.
It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.
The name of the game is to get after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you, right?
And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work.
It's better than those that don't play.
I'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink.
How good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict, so the young guys here at the top of their game probably, like, did a little better than some of us that are older.
Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some people that are serious out there. Yeah.
They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.
Different video games have a different effect on your brains.
Now because we are interested in having an impact for education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform.
One more. Get those brains working. Come on.
Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy, or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?
Actually, I think it'll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that's emerged in the past century.
Well, I have to admit, actually, that I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica: I wanted to use it myself, a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope 400 years ago.
So here it is.
The only way to find its outcome is, effectively, just to watch it evolve.
So, it's been a big, very complex project, which I was not sure was going to work at all.
Let's do some mathy thing, and with luck it'll work out the answer and try and tell us some interesting things things about related math.
So let's type that in, and now Wolfram Alpha will go and use available public health data and try and figure out what part of the population that corresponds to and so on.
Given raw facts or data to actually answer questions, one has to compute: one has to implement all those methods and models and algorithms and so on that science and other areas have built up over the centuries.
So, I'm pretty pleased with it all.
Here's something where we're sort of integrating a bunch of different capabilities here.
Okay. Let's zoom out again.
In a sense, we can use the computational universe to get mass customized creativity.
And each possible rule, in a sense, corresponds to a candidate universe.
One's got to build a lot of technology.
Thank you.
Does your work relate to his?
The greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden.
And the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world, because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS.
Thank you very much.
The girls are brought up to be mothers.
My father worked as a policeman in the city.
I wanted to become a teacher.
Once I go through this tradition, I was going to become a wife.
It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it.
And as she carried the knife, she walked toward me and she held the clitoris, and she cut it off.
Well, while I was in high school, something happened.
There's a belief among our people that morning brings good news.
They all came together.
And as we speak right now, three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation.
Because there had not been any school for girls.
And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school.
Five months later, that is Angeline.
One hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams.
I want to challenge you today that to be the first, because people will follow you.
Unemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down.
This was World War II. Do you know why savings was so high?
And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education, future children in our households.
Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter, spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years, almost a 3.7 percent decline.
I'll give you some examples. Lets talk about dentists, vasectomies, guns and shark attacks. Okay?
If you think about the last three decades, the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '90s, to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade, but the one thing that has been holding them back is the ability to discriminate.
The management principle is dollars and cents.
Agritourism, going to vineyards and going to farms.
Increasingly, consumers are looking at the culture of the company, looking for their conduct in the marketplace.
They are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with I.T. training, using their existing infrastructure to do something good.
We also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for America.
They want these skills.
So, it's a consumer driven co-op.
Everything about locally derived products and services, supporting your local neighborhoods, whether it's cheeses, wines and other products.
Have a stick? Well why not have a carrot?
Well, they have a lot, because it's their network of people. Right?
It will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share.
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as, their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.
And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"
You could abuse it.
And it's simple.

In fact, I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood.
In response she said, "Yes, praying is effective, but also beware of the power of circles."
I was constantly telling stories at home, which was good, except I told this to imaginary friends around me, which was not so good.
It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the "representative foreigner."
After Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany and Ankara again.
In the face of death and destruction, our mundane differences evaporated, and we all became one even if for a few hours.
When you're a latecomer to a language, what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration.
Stories accompany me, keeping my pieces and memories together, like an existential glue.
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one.
When identity politics tries to put labels on us, it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger.
Chekhov said, "The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things.
They would go to coffee houses, where they would tell a story in front of an audience, often improvising.
When the poet and mystic, Rumi, met his spiritual companion, Shams of Tabriz, one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi's books into water and watch the letters dissolve.
In the palace, just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines, there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn.
As long as it comes from our hearts, we can write about anything and everything.
And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem: "Come, let us be friends for once; let us make life easy on us; let us be lovers and loved ones; the earth shall be left to no one."
It's how you remix. You take existing songs, you chop them up, you transform the pieces, you combine them back together again, and you've got a new song, but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs.
Last one, this is "Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons," another traditional folk tune.
Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable."
It's the same animal, at least.
I'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent.
Okay, so that's in '96. Here's in 2010.
Is this promoting the progress of useful arts?
Thank you. Thank you.
They say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16."
He says, "Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built.
Because, if I'm going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration, I should tell you how much it costs.
That percentage, by the way, is about the same in the U.S. and Germany and France.
So, tiny moon.
So what we're saying, essentially, is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system.
So what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa, which is a thick sheet of ice, probably a hundred kilometers thick.
Well, there is.
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics.
What you're seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow like a white light, it just emits light at particular colors, a red one, a light blue one, some dark blue ones.
That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars.
So that star is also 50 million light years away.
Now, there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the Big Bang.
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet.
But that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet.
And I'd like to read you what Sagan wrote about it, just to finish, because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken.
You could have made it in the 1920s; you wouldn't have had penicillin.
Thank you.
The visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion and it's an experimental browser add-on that you can install in your Firefox browser that helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you.
And in this particular case I happened to like one of them on the merits of music literacy in schools and I shared it over a social network.
The gray dots have grown exponentially.
This is a nine-year-old girl navigating to principally children's sites.
Today we've launched Collusion.
And the first words that I spoke were in Washington, D.C., on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.
Well, I want to take you on this journey.
And they said, "No, you're walking to make us look bad, right?
And then I would launch in.
And I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did.
He said, "Listen, we're really proud of you son, but what are you going to do with a bachelor's degree?
The director of the program said, "Come back tomorrow."
They saw that I was really interested in the environment, and they really wanted to help me along the way.
"I don't know, I think he's talking about clear cutting." "Yeah, clear cutting."
My dad came out to see me graduate and, you know, I did the deal, and my father said, "We're really proud of you son, but ... " You know what went on, he said, "You've got to start riding and driving and start talking.
Well, I put on my backpack again.
How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference?
And so that's the message that I had.
What possessed me to say this thing?
But the thing that was different was that every birthday, I asked myself about silence, but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet.
I know I needed to change, because it would be the only way that I could be here today.
So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence.
On my ninth birthday, my parents couldn't give me any food to eat.
My daily life became very hard, but very simple.
I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen.
By a miracle, some months later, I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans, and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years.
I was only 11 or 12, but it hurt me deeply.
He just looked back at me very warmly, but said no words.
You have to make it yourself.
This is my message to you.
Joseph Kim: In Korean?
AH: Sure, please.
After, the building was recycled.
It's a very popular museum now, and I created a big monument for the government.
Then people need some temporary housing, but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people.
It just became big, heavy deforestation and an environmental problem.
After a fire, what are you proposing?"
So during the summer with my students, we built over 50 units of the shelters.
Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money.
And this is a very interesting photo: former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso -- you know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year.
I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable, within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same, but much more comfortable.
Thank you very much.
And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we're born, while we're still in the womb.
When we hold our babies for the first time, we might imagine that they're clean slates, unmarked by life, when in fact, they've already been shaped by us and by the particular world we live in.
Researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples, so that if a baby sucks on one, it hears a recording of its mother's voice on a pair of headphones, and if it sucks on the other nipple, it hears a recording of a female stranger's voice.
From the moment of birth, the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it -- its mother.
A sort of French version of this experiment was carried out in Dijon, France where researchers found that mothers who consumed food and drink flavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy showed a preference for anise on their first day of life, and again, when they were tested later, on their fourth day of life.
They make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself.
Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy were immediately apparent in higher rates of stillbirths, birth defects, low birth weights and infant mortality.
It seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly.
Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post-war Western diet.
But there's another way of thinking about PTSD.
Thank you.
It seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask, why, in a technological age, we continue to have this magical sense of wonder.
We do it every day, while reading novels, watching television or going to the movies.
Now many of them are intensely dramatic.
That makes my job more difficult, because, if I want to surprise them, I need to tell a story that starts the same, but ends differently -- a trick with a twist on a twist.
We polish the rough edges of our lives so that they feel whole.
Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.
You'd still have five billion left in change, and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.
Just interested, did anybody notice anything different as a result of this at all?
It's the lift, it's a series of buttons in the lift.
It was simply to encourage the inoculation of children by, not only making it a social event -- I think good use of behavioral economics in that, if you turn up with several other mothers to have your child inoculated, your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone.
What is completely lacking is a class of people who have immense amounts of power, but no money at all.
I said, "It's really, really easy."
But what's interesting about that suggestion was that, to implement that suggestion wouldn't cost 10 million pounds; it wouldn't involve large amounts of expenditure; it would actually cost about 50 quid.
In truth, we do live in a world that science can understand.
He developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services, no longer tied to a single monopoly provider, in many cases, sourcing things locally, and of course, the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time led for better load-balancing.
That's why I call for the "Chief Detail Officer."
I still start every day practicing playing Bach.
I become the medium through which the music is being channeled, and in the process, when all is right, the music is transformed and so am I.
And I'm going to show you two demos of why this is useful.
And why this is interesting is I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor, which has a 3D room, with some targets floating in it.
YouTube has really changed the way, or changed the speed, in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world.
And I also was taught, coupled with that, that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job, apparently, to help.
And I felt overwhelmed.
And after a while, I developed what I think many of us do, is this predictable response, where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.
I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid and I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough that I gave to relieve my own suffering, not someone else's.
I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is, but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak, Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance.
He was talking about strong, smart, hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.
So I saw that and it was very humbling.
And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things, from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.
And then that first year, October '05 through '06, Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines.
And as I look forward to what is next, it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.
When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time, you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.
So one is that, of course, as we all might expect, many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month.
And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile, create investment terms in a really easy way.
Thanks.
The questions I would like to talk about are: one, where did we come from?
This was the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe.
Under extreme conditions, general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space.
We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing.
Furthermore, despite an extensive search by the SETI project, we haven't heard any alien television quiz shows.
The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years.
Stephen Hawking: I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years; otherwise we would have heard radio waves.
But our multitasking reality is pretty different, and full of tons of information.
I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate.
Now, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone, haven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea, but it was that idea -- the fact that you could in fact prove that there's somebody out there just using this same technology -- that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job at the SETI Institute. Now, I have to say that my memory is notoriously porous, and I've often wondered whether there was any truth in this story, or I was just, you know, misremembering something, but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine, and sure enough, there you can see the Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that analog calculating device.
This is the Allen Telescope Array, about 350 miles from whatever seat you're in right now.
In other words, we're looking for a needle in a haystack.
I mean, how many of those star systems have planets?
Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's one in a thousand, that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the Earth just in our own galaxy.
I happen to know what the consequence for me would be, because we've had false alarms. This is 1997, and this is a photo I made at about 3 o'clock in the morning in Mountain View here, when we were watching the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal that we thought, "This is the real deal." All right?
That's one thing. Another thing that's for sure going to happen is that it will calibrate us.
Now, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about explorers. I find exploration very interesting, Arctic exploration, you know, people like Magellan, Amundsen, Shackleton, you see Franklin down there, Scott, all these guys. It's really nifty, exploration.
Polls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago.
In the 19th century, if you had a basement lab, you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home. Right? Because there was all this science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up.
SETI, on the other hand, is really simple.
Okay, so we're interested in these sorts of things.
It was like Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate," right, when he said "plastics," whatever that means, plastics.
It's a sextra-quadra-hexa-something or other." Right?
I'm a geologist by training. But I love that.
But I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing.
He takes a step back -- so he's keeping off the other males by splitting his body -- and comes up on the other side ...
That's an amazing thing.
The best thing to do is to get as big as I can get."
We all have come from a long way, here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa, which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place.
It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia.
And then, the analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material.
A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this.
Let's go somewhere else."
It took five years.
You don't see that in chimpanzees, and you don't see this very projecting canine.
And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three.
In chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent.
This is called the hyoid bone. It's a bone which is right here.
To summarize the significance of this fossil, we can say the following.
That's because we Africans concentrate -- I am from Ethiopia, by the way -- we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere, or from outside.
We are talking about the high seas.
This is indeed the true heart of the planet.
What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas.
But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed, to create a new regime.
It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs.
So what we need to do is to stand up boldly, singly and together, to push governments, to push regional fisheries management organizations, to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing, so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.
Many species are headed through this region, which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
We have the support of governments now behind us.
It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate, if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources, we need to know -- someone needs to know -- where you are and what you're doing.
We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect.
And she wanted to make something of her life, and she asked me a simple little question.
Carol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do."
And push! David Gallo says, "Push yourself.
And the first thing I say to them is: "OK, well you can't serve yourself; you gotta serve others something of value.
Or failing that, do the eight things -- and trust me, these are the big eight things that lead to success.
One of them actually, fittingly enough, found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare.
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones, complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die.
But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime?
The problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition that Archie doesn't really understand.
And Archie Cochrane, as the camp doctor, was one of the first men in to clear up the mess.
And importantly, it's a rich source of vitamin B12.
And he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated, and he vents his frustrations.
Now I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very, very easily.
Now you won't be able to understand a word of it, but this is what it looks like.
Imagine you had one second per product category.
The complexity here is unbelievable.
We clearly can.
Over millions of years, variation and selection, variation and selection -- trial and error, trial and error.
It falls to the floor.
Even this problem, too complicated.
We have no idea why it works, no idea at all.
So I say, okay, fine.
I have half a dozen ideas.
He wanted to test out the question of, where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks?
And it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong.
Would you like to close down the trial now, or should we wait until we have robust results?"
It isn't easy.
His friend, Goro Shimura -- who worked on the mathematics with him -- many decades later, reflected on Taniyama's life.
This is not a philosophical statement, this is just science based in physics, chemistry and biology.
That the crazy idea is just that, it is crazy, and with the Earth full, it's game over.
The problem is we're just warming up this growth engine.
And these are not esoteric limits.
Let's just think through that idea.
I accept where we are.
But we see, mistakenly, each of these issues as individual problems to be solved.
Imagine our economy when the carbon bubble bursts, when the financial markets recognize that, to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control, the oil and coal industries are finished.
Just take a moment and take a breath and think, what do you feel at this point?
We are smart, in fact, we really are quite amazing, but we do love a good crisis.
You can read the details, but in summary, we can transform our economy.
We need to act like we only have one planet.
Like generations before us, we'll be growing up in war -- not a war between civilizations, but a war for civilization, for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society which is stronger and happier and plans on staying around into middle age.
But of course what we have to remember is this.
So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.
The government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.
Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.
The orange slice is what's discretionary.
Sixty-eight is young today.
So, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis back in the late '80s.
Among other things, because startup companies are .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm and they're about 17.8 percent of output.
So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.
Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.
The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious.
It's almost like leaving Congress.
Those stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.
Didn't happen.
You've also got flies, the size of flies, that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard.
I mean, your grandparents had these great big cones, and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner, and now we have these little buds that nobody sees.
And then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition, and one day, they'll see as well as you and I can.
And that's the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record, erectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals, and Homo sapiens, all overlap.
I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.
And along came a brilliant inventor, a scientist, who came up with a partial cure for that disease.
For many years this went along, and everything was fine.
And he decided that maybe he should leave the country for a few days, and seek out some more intelligent, open-minded people in a place called Oxford, and come and try and tell the story at that place.
So if you look at that data -- it's right up on the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's website -- you can just look at the raw data, and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up.
And that's that middle set of bars.
And I think that's because they've been optimized to pass, as we always expect people to do, to optimize relative to bright-line rules about how affected the car will be.
And so I had some friends over to dinner, and I was asking -- we had a cookout -- I was asking them what advice they might have for me about proving my point. They said, "Why don't you run some crash tests?"
So they just have these bench seats, and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it.
Bear in mind there are two things about this.
And then here's the six-year-old in the seatbelt, and in fact, they get exactly within, you know, within one or two points of the same. So really, for the six-year-old, the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever.
But essentially, do something like this, which I don't know exactly how much it would cost to do, but there's no reason I could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat.
And when they came back, he, still convinced they were not sick, had another jar of pills. In this jar were huge horse pills.
And that's completely possible. And if that's the case, then I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come.
But it's obviously a critical question.
And if I told you it was all coming for free, you would say, this is simply -- you're dreaming.
So, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days.
So, I was trying to basically make measurements.
Because in fact, that's how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works.
So let me go through those three things.
And in some ways, it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing.
They're going to talk to the machine.
And while there's many differences in some senses, they will share more and more in common with each other.
And the other thing about this embodiment is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal.
And we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world.
You couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you, you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody.
Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are.
Everything we've described, every artifact or place, will be a specific representation, will have a specific character that can be linked to directly.
That is going to be the price.
So we are the Web, that's what this thing is.
And again, the price of that will be transparency.
And again, I don't want to talk about consciousness, I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria, or a volvox, which is what that organism is.
I was 17 and going on a peace walk.
And after about five years of doing this, I was arrested for kidnapping.
The bottom picture is Hitler youth.
These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable.
And the thing is, though, if you looked at my brain during those years in the Moonies -- neuroscience is expanding exponentially, as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding.
I don't know your name. Audience Member: Howard. Howard.
And to be an architect, somehow you have to negotiate between left and right, and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the outside world, and then make it understood.
And it's not based on an a priori notion.
And it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer, observing every kilometer a particular object of desire, and then placing that within this.
And that directly connects to ideas of city-making.
It's the clothing, the skin, without the presence of the character.
If you look at most buildings, what you look at is the building, the facade, and it is the building.
We're using light as a building material in this case.
I wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it.
We could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground.
So it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth.
And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles that uses some of the same ideas. It uses landscape as a major idea.
And then that, in turn, propelled us to look at larger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue.
Nature in the 19th-century sense, alright?
Thank you so much.
Smile. Smile. Open the mouths.
So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves.
Because brains are expensive.
So if we think about this unleashing human potential, which was possible by cooking and food, why do we talk so badly about food?
This technology affected two organs, the brain and the gut, which it actually affected.
How did it actually interfere?
So my story is a tale of two brains, because it might surprise you, our gut has a full-fledged brain.
And between this muscle, they found nervous tissues, a lot of nervous tissues, which penetrate actually the muscle -- penetrate the submucosa, where you have all the elements for the immune system.
It has autonomous organized microcircuits, has these programs which run.
The lower layer, our gut brain, has its own goals -- digestion defense -- and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors.
So if you override the hunger signal, you can have a disorder, which is called anorexia.
Now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signals are so strong that the big brain cannot ignore it?
This whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil.
Thank you very much.
All of this is part of our common experience, and this shouldn't surprise us, because, after all, biologists have finally proven it to be true, something that philosophers have always dreamt to be true.
Well, let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere ever brought into being by the imagination, that of Polynesia.
What is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth?
All life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative.
You may not believe that we achieve enlightenment in one lifetime, but we do.
And of course, the waylakama spin, the trajectory of the route, is marked by holy mounds of Earth, where coke is given to the Earth, libations of alcohol to the wind, the vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop.
Machu Picchu was never a lost city.
And where does the river rise?
The gourd is a feminine aspect; the stick is a male.
And I said, "Danilo, you won't remember this, but when you were an infant, I carried you on my back, up and down the mountains."
And you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet -- there must be nothing between the feet and the Earth for a mamo.
We were able to, because we had trained people in filmmaking, continue with our work, and send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers to the final sacred lakes to get the last shots for the film, and we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea, taking the elements from the highlands to the sea.
So, their entire year has been cut in half.
And collectively, those voices become our human repertoire for dealing with the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia.
In every case, these are dynamic, living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces.
In a single cubic foot of this material -- about what would come around your computer or large television -- you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol.
And lastly, and I think perhaps most importantly, we should be creating materials that fit into what I call nature's recycling system.
And what we've discovered is, by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen -- analogous to its root structure; it's called mycelium -- we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics.
Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles, and that's where the magic happens, because the organism is doing the work in this process, not the equipment.
And what they're doing in our equipment is going through a continuous system, which cleans, cooks, cools and pasteurizes these materials, while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium.
This matrix self-assembles, growing through and around the particles, making millions and millions of tiny fibers.
They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing, and it's going to improve the local soil.
They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great.
It makes it hotter. It's happening right now.
But the experiment is not the end of the story, because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people.
Instead of explaining their research with words, scientists have to explain it with dance.
So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions.
There are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool, and like any tool, it can and will be abused.
The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed.
Of course someday, in the deep future, a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented, rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric.
To which the answer is, "The extroverted statistician's the one who looks at the other person's shoes."
Or they'll suddenly become parched and/or hungry -- and often both -- and sprint off for a drink and some food.
You've got to think, and I'm going to ask you some questions.
The first time they do it, maybe it happens after the 10th toss, as here.
So here's a deep mathematical fact -- if you've got two numbers, one of three things must be true.
OK. So most people think B is true.
That turns out to be important.
You're done, and you celebrate.
Another way of thinking about it -- if we tossed a coin eight million times, then we'd expect a million head-tail-heads and a million head-tail-tails -- but the head-tail-heads could occur in clumps.
And they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology.
We don't know what causes them.
So a natural answer is 99 percent.
So let's think about a disease that affects -- it's pretty rare, it affects one person in 10,000.
So even though we think the test is accurate, the important part of the story is there's another bit of information we need.
And initially, it was thought that they died of what's known informally as "cot death," and more formally as "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome."
So he said, "I'll assume that if you have one cot death in a family, the chance of a second child dying from cot death aren't changed."
It might well be that there are environmental factors that we're not aware of, and it's pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we're not aware of.
It's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test, which is 99 percent accurate, the chance of having the disease is 99 percent.
In fact, there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the evidence of this pediatrician, who have subsequently been released on appeal.
That's an issue in our everyday lives.
And everyone said, "Well, that's fine. He's an expert."
In other spheres of life, if people argued -- well, except possibly for politics -- but in other spheres of life, if people argued illogically, we'd say that's not a good thing.
Well, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this.
And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it.
This invention will reduce global energy consumption by allowing remote control and automation of every outlet in every home and business.
And I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity to unveil our technology with you, and soon the world.
In the north, there was a great wall, Chang Cheng.
So today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version.
So, that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship.
And now the result is very simple.
So when these 300 million people, microbloggers, even they block the tweet in our censored platform.
So a suggestion, it's not good to go outside.
You can almost have all the journalistic elements there.
So these innovations and clones, as the Weibo and microblogging, when it came to China in 2009, it immediately became a media platform itself.
Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people.
Weird phrases and words, even if you have a PhD of Chinese language, you can't understand them.
The cat is the censorship, but Chinese is not only one cat, but also has local cats. Central cat and local cats.
But from February to April this year, Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors.
It was made famous by Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong, because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government.
After all, we are the mouse.

Really what we want to hear is music.
Owl, yeah.
And that was the best you could do for hearing loss.
And this is a video that was taken by my surgical mentor, Dr. John Niparko, who implanted her.
So it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her.
And there's no way that you can't look at that as an overwhelming success.
You don't care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken.
I mean, most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music.
That's kind of hypnotic.
Go ahead and play that.
Because his grave was exhumed.
CL: Now I'm not suggesting that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we're hearing it.
But although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time, they weren't very helpful.
And the fact that he can play the piano like that is a testament to his brain.
But I tell you, if we lost our hearing, if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing, you would want perfect hearing back.
When I look around, I see people who want to make a contribution, I see people who want to make a better world, by doing groundbreaking scientific work, by creating impressive works of art, by writing critical articles or inspiring books, by starting up sustainable businesses.
I did not choose to take up the pen, the brush, the camera.
Why did I choose the gun as my instrument?
They meant to rule by means of repression.
He fired again.
It was then that I decided I would take up the gun -- out of respect and gratitude for those men and women who came to liberate us -- from the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil.
Despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news, wars between developed countries are no longer commonplace.
In his latest book, Harvard professor Steven Pinker -- and many other thinkers before him -- concludes that one of the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state and the introduction on a large scale of the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence -- legitimized by a democratically elected government, legitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system.
With trade, there's mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties.
Failed states have no legitimized, democratically controlled use of force.
I hope you will respect my soldiers, this soldier with this gun.
So that's great. So that was too easy.
When this amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms, these little letters are sticky for each other.
These short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make. So you send an e-mail with these sequences in it to a company, and what it does -- the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer.
And a lot of them are actually pretty good.
But really, truly -- often you think about letting go way before your body does.
This is a climb called the Naked Edge, in El Dorado Canyon, outside of Boulder.
But you also can't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete.
They think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long.
I've been quite interested in both.
I did enjoy Bono's comment linking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley.
I've got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather data on key measures of technology in many different areas, and we build models.
We had our best Ph.D. students, our most advanced equipment around the world, we got 1/10,000th of the project done, so how're we going to get this done in 15 years?
Cell phones were adopted in about eight years.
But anyway, the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years, and then working through interaction, evolution used, essentially, the technology-creating species to bring on the next stage, which were the first steps in technological evolution.
Information technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth, every year.
Processor performance on Intel chips, the average price of a transistor -- 1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar.
They're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors, so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years.
We've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars in information technology over the last 50 years.
We'd like to actually turn that program off.
And this technology is also accelerating.
One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait, that's built out of molecules.
You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours -- so, "Honey, I'm in the pool," will take on a whole new meaning.
Well, it turns out we can see inside the human brain, and in fact not surprisingly, the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.
Images will be written directly to our retina, providing full-immersion virtual reality, augmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities.
But they'll also go inside our brain, interact with our biological neurons.
Many -- even scientists -- assume a linear model, so they'll say, "Oh, it'll be hundreds of years before we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly or artificial intelligence."
Another update: You will recall I introduced you guys to the Quadro Tracker.
In this case, at trespass points, allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay, actually cost lives.
So like Fox Mulder on "X-Files," who wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do, and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains.
When we do this process, we make two types of errors.
Well, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind, you've made an error in cognition, made a Type I error, false positive.
Yes, of course, it's a cow.
That's a good audience, Chris.
What do you see in this particular one here, in this field?
So what we're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens.
On the other hand, amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists.
Just right, you're creative, and yet you don't fall for too much baloney.
And of course you all know exactly what this is, right?
Because the lights on here.
Faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes.
Well, why is this happening?
And I call this process agenticity.
But this is a pattern detection problem, isn't it?
Explains a lot, maybe.
Our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these.
It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief.
Girl: That would be fine.
One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates, and taken in the bushes -- I was stripped; I was attacked; I was abused; and this came out of the blue.
And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision then -- well, we made a proposal, for a couple of years, about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists.
Text: "Between Two Fires: Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda" When we were at home, it was Kony's [rebel] soldiers disturbing us.
And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also.
I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport, and he told me a story that, in the middle of the night, 4 a.m., he'd been taken out of his home in Queens -- taken to a place in the Midwest, that he was interrogated and tortured and returned to the street four weeks later, because he had the same -- he was Middle Eastern, and he had the same name as one of the 9/11 pilots, and that may or may not be true -- I didn't think he was a liar, though.
But you can't say what you just saw never happened.
So this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do things that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing.
Ten percent of the species actually make a ball, and this ball they roll away from the dung source, usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source, and they have a very particular behavior by which they are able to roll their balls.
What are they doing? And there was a cue that was available to us.
The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them.
How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line?
He does a little dance, he turns around, and heads back in this. He knows exactly where he's going.
one was hot, one was cold.
And what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool.
And we also cooled down the dung ball, so we were able to put the ball in the fridge, gave them a nice cool dung ball, and they climbed onto that ball far less often than when they had a hot ball.
This is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior.
He displaces the beetle, and now we have to see what is going to take place.
It starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food, but it is clearly completely lost.
And it's the combination of these things that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization, and, on occasion, has led me to play with fire.
Thank you.
So if I show you another song off this album, and another, your eyes will easily pick out the use of repetition by the band Nirvana, and in the frequency distribution, the colors, you can see the clean-dirty-clean sound that they are famous for, and here is the entire album as a single visual impression, and I think this impression is pretty powerful.
And it's fascinating. At this moment in time, all the rest of the skaters turn their lines 90 degrees to stay out of his way.
So I made a more interactive version, and the way I did that is I used their position in time in the lecture to place these stars into 3D space, and with some custom software and a Kinect, I can walk right into the lecture.
It usually begins here, and it grows and then it falls.
And that's what my mom was like when I did it.
And he said: "As an animator you are not a director, you're an actor."
And I'm actually redesigning the robot so, unbeknownst to itself, it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me.
But, moving in graceful ways is just one building block of this whole structure called human-robot interaction.
It all just happened.
I actually participated in a play, I hope theres no video of that around still.
Improvise, play off yor scene partner.
Maybe it can make for better robotic teammates.
They even called it 'he' and 'she,' whereas people with the calculated brain called it 'it.' And nobody ever called it 'he' or 'she'.
And I thought, music, that's the perfect place to look at teamwork, coordination, timing, improvisation -- and we just got this robot playing marimba.
And so I tried to make a robot that doesn't actually know what it's doing, but it's still doing it.
These are some napkin sketches from a bar in Atlanta, that was dangerously located exactly halfway between my lab and my home.
Now it's looking at me to make sure I'm listening.
And the reason is that we can't ignore physical things moving in our environment.
And so again, here are some animation tests from an early stage.
Maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise.
There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever.
The furthest I've ever got away from my front door was in the spring of 2004. I still don't know exactly what came over me, but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean.
And that journey lasted 10 weeks, 72 days.
I can try to tell you what it was like, but you'll never know what it was like, and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely, I was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles, it was cold, nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day, the more words fall short, and I'm unable to do it justice.
Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole.
It is, arguably, the most audacious endeavor of that Edwardian golden age of exploration, and it seemed to me high time, given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels, that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job.
And yet, if I've learned anything in nearly 12 years now of dragging heavy things around cold places, it is that true, real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge, from stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown.
And there are obviously all kinds of things.
Right, so here you want -- entrepreneurs by definition are people who are leaving something else, starting a new world over here, creating and putting their lifeblood into this kind of thing.
Because even if you didn't do it right the first time, you've learned the lessons, which are going to stand you in very good stead the next time.
So you've got to know your market.
All right, then, having done all that, what else do I want to know as a VC?
You've got to be able to see where this is going.
So I need to know that you have the ability to listen.
You can go up, you can go down, right?
And everything has got to be reinforcing this.
It's got to be upside, and it's got to be believable.
So, you've got to take me through like a sixth grader -- dub, dub, dub, dub, dub -- but without patronizing me.
So let's look at the most successful technology executive in the business and see how a presentation goes.
What are you focusing on?
How many bullet points or headlines does Steve Jobs use?
So let's run through the things you've got to include in your presentation.
"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market."
I want to know your product, and that's very important.
If I know what your competition does, how are you going to prevent your competition from eating your lunch over here?
We're going to have 1,000 customers this year, and 10,000 next year.
I hope you invested personally.
And then you take me back to your logo.
So now, how do I know what's going on here?
David's -- I usually do a top 10, we don't have time for top 10s.
If you follow my suggestions, you're going to have a very spare, very Zen-like presentation, which is great for conveying who you are and getting people emotionally involved.
So, last month, the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced that it is going out of print after 244 years, which made me nostalgic, because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when I was a kid, maybe 12 years old.
Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from.
Famous for its diversity, human diversity.
Statistically, one of you is a beetle.
Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex.
So when I click on "sympathetic magic," I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls.
And I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for "hand," go to the page for "hand," where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia I've found in a long time. It's simply this: The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar.
He's born in Cameroon, which is smack in the middle of my tropics map, and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles.
And then when you've had your fill of that, you can click on one more link.
And that makes me really sad because I'm sick and tired of things not working.
That's social. Let's look at education.
Last in Europe GDP per capita.
We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better, for ourselves, for our friends, for our family and for our future.
And we devalue it in three areas.
I can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground.
But then what happens in step three?
We went to this prestigious little school and they say they're going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff.
And that's why we're last, because we don't value play.
Evolution does a really, really good job of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage.
But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer.
And it's not just kids, it's adults too.
Just like there's benefits to animals, there's benefits to humans.
And if we handicap ourselves with play, we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have.
Is it fun? Is it playful?
Just like there's benefits for humans and animals, there's benefits for play at work.
Play increases productivity, not decreases.
We had marginal profit -- I did.
Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys.
You're the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution.
Fear is the enemy of play.
Is that all there was?"
You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about reinvigorating our lives, our schools, and our work with play; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment; of how play promotes innovation and productivity, and, ultimately, how play creates meaning.
Some of them were familiar stories.
There was no mediator between him and the audience.
Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.
One reviewer called Elliott's story "Twitter fiction done right," because she did.
They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium.
This foul-mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race, providing commentary as it went.
Crimer Show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K., but, man, is it weird.
In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.
I still have -- or did I use the word still? I didn't mean that.
Well, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant, more comfortable than just the craftsmen do.
My first exhibition in the United States was at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 -- that the Hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn pieces as part of the exhibit.
After that, it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in, kind of, a mangle.
And I visited it with several ladies, and asked all sorts of questions of the director.
So as a journeyman, I put an ad into the paper that I had studied, that I was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman and I was looking for a job as a journeyman.
If I go on like this, you will be here till midnight.
The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life.
I had a fire nine days ago.
I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said, "Come dig."
And those are some of the pictures that -- something was good about the burnt pictures.
The negatives are gone.
I came to live it, and I am living it.
It was a website called Nerve.com, the tagline of which was "literate smut."
AV: It's true. So like we said, the early years were really wonderful, but they were also really difficult.
We really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing, and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight.
Alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child -- -- and I was there with a catcher's mitt.
You love, or you don't love.
AV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.
I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me, tracking it down till the actual due-date.
And it's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation is our modern world.
And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant, and I soon learned that we were having a boy, and then when I was five months, we learned that we had lost our child.
People I interacted with daily, worked with, was friends with, family members that I had known a long time, had never shared with me their own stories.
So taboo number four: you can't say that your average happiness has declined since having a child.
RG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents, because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies.
So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this?
And if you're really passionate about what you do every day -- which we are -- and you're also passionate about your relationship, this is the only way we know how to do it.
So the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty, but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences, that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit.
Let's separate the performance, as a thing, out from the recording, which was how it was made.
And we look at every single note, and all the attributes of those notes: how hard they were struck, and how they were held down, and how you move the fingers.
Bach only wrote themes and variations one time.
First of all, let me get you to the end step.
Ultimately, I started with the experience.
Without putting dates next to these things, step-by-step music will be turned into data, like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years.
And Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano, and he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it.
Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data -- no Glenn Gould in the room.
It's so amazing, it's so exciting.
And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine, which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people.
So thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity.
There's a definition of leadership which says, "It's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis for the biggest possible effect."
And I spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts.
And I think you can see around us now, some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow.
But I think last year when governments did step in, people were quite glad that they were there, that they did act.
You can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world.
But we also know it's only through experiment that we'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city, how to care for a much older population, how to deal with drug addiction and so on.
He believed if you see a problem, you shouldn't tell someone to act, you should act on it yourself, and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer.
People come together to sing about the things that really bug them.
Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade, but only with radical and systematic experiment, not just with technologies, but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too.
History was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy.
And that is, why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display radically different savings behavior?
And what you can see is that over the last 25 years, Greece has barely managed to save more than 10 percent of their GDP.
Suppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle.
Notice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events.
What you may not have realized is that English is actually an outlier.
If that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically, that's going to make it easier to save.
What is the average difference here?
So imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door.
Now even after all of this granular level of control, do futureless language speakers seem to save more?
It's current pleasure in exchange for future pain.
You think I've lost my way, and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat.
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi.
Well I don't know.
Now this is the major change that I've seen -- how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today.
We English teachers reject them all the time.
Okay.
But fortunately for the world, he did not have to pass an English test.
And to do that, they need a Western education.
But if another language can think that thought, then, by cooperating, we can achieve and learn so much more.
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp.
I am known best for human-powered flight, but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that I'm working in now.
So suddenly, I was interested in human-powered flight -- -- and did not -- the way I approached it, first, thinking about ways to make the planes, was just like they'd been doing in England, and not succeeding, and I gave it up. I figured, nah, there isn't any simple, easy way.
And Brian Allen was able, in a miraculous flight, to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel, and we won the 100,000-pound, 200,000-dollar prize for that.
And for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time, the little differences in the Earth.
You don't need to dig down for these chemicals, and we can do things much more efficiently.
As time went on, we stopped our environmental programs.
As the sky gets darker, and the outside air temperatures drop below minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the most environmentally hostile segment of Helios's journey has gone by without notice, except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors.
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.
A They called it their Walkalong Glider.
And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.
And that's it, yeah, just a few inventions.
The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend.
And he became interested in that.
And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff, its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.
And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore.
So, he had a brilliant idea.
And he had to close his eyes, it's so disgusting, and the smell and everything.
And, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love."
So that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya.
But, you know, after all, they're nice to me.
And then the next thing we do is what is called "mother recognition."
I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form.
And you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely.
Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being, but when they're happy they look beautiful.
So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy, because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble.
And they think of it as somehow macho, hard discipline on themselves.
And so the next step -- the sixth step beyond "universal compassion" -- is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way, and you have compassion for yourself also, and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something.
But "kindness" means "universal responsibility."
The quote is from the fabled Potter Stewart opinion on pornography.
But also, by the way, the coffee is hot, the liquid is sterile; you're not likely to get cholera that way.
And here I've corrupted the Potter Stewart quotation by saying that we can think about something -- which spans all the way from scissors to the cell phone, Internet and birth control pills -- by saying that they're simple, the functions are simple, and we recognize what that simplicity is when we see it.
And, since this is coming from a moral philosopher, the fourth would be that it's part of God's plan for the universe.
Simplicity -- all of you really would like your Waring Blender in the morning to make whatever a Waring Blender does, but not explode or play Beethoven.
These are cars and drivers. They dissipate energy.
Terrific. You learn everything you can about that.
Or I'm going to use simple to mean reliable, predictable, repeatable.
So, since the transistor is so simple, you can put lots of them together.
The two blobs that are light in the middle there are the United States and Europe.
The second is, and this is a real world statement, they're cheap.
But if you have something that has a function, and it's really cheap, people will find new ways of putting it together to make new things.
It's a little paper chip.
Part of my interest in this, I have to say, is that I would like to -- how do I put this politely? -- change the way, or maybe eviscerate, the capital structure of the U.S. health care system, which I think is fundamentally broken.
And that certainly is going in the right direction.
GW: Well, no.
This is a category entirely created by consumers that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market because they couldn't see the need, the opportunity; they didn't have the incentive to innovate.
What's the policy recommendation out of that if you're in government, or you're running a large company?
The payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest.
The truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative; like Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time.
Best example: who in the music industry, 30 years ago, would have said, "Yes, let's invent a musical form which is all about dispossessed black men in ghettos expressing their frustration with the world through a form of music that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to.
Largely through globalization, a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper.
Now, six amateur astronomers, working with the Internet, with Dobsonian digital telescopes -- which are pretty much open source -- with some light sensors developed over the last 10 years, the Internet -- they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 years ago.
These people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding, because they're threatened by them.
That's not their role; they're supposed to read what we write.
I think the idea of creating the Red Cross for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea, but can we really organize that, just on volunteers?
I was in Shanghai, in an office block built on what was a rice paddy five years ago -- one of the 2,500 skyscrapers they've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years.
Because basically, he doesn't service them.
Every morning, there are 600 people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters.
Thank you very much.
I put together projects like Earth Sandwich, where I ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the Earth.
But this project changed the way that I thought about connecting to people.
We have to remix it. He's got a great voice.
And so I said, "Let's put this together in an album."
And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world.
It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces, and we have to get better at figuring that out.
"They used some of the morbidly artist footage, a close-up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway.
Recording: Okay, here's something.
"From 52 to 48 with love" was a project around the time of the last election cycle, where McCain and Obama both, in their speeches after the election, talked about reconciliation, and I was like, "What the hell does that look like?"
"From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you, but I doubt it."
So I was like, "Awesome. This is great."
So, you know, people were writing me and saying, "How's your new job?"
I said, "Okay, I'll think about it."
And then a few days later I sent her this.
And so some of the brains that I've studied are people you know about.
You get different kinds of psychopaths.
Because a daughter can get one X from the father, one X from the mother, it's kind of diluted out.
And what I think might happen in these areas of the world, where we have constant violence, you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence.
And that book is very interesting. Because it's about witch trials, and how people thought back then.
But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here.
It's 27 kilometers in circumference.
You get some sense of the size: 44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter, 7,000 tons.
So, you might be asking, "Why?
So, way back in the early times of the universe, we believe it was very simple and understandable.
The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons.
So, this thing was discovered in the year 2000, so it's a relatively recent picture.
A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.
So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit.
The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles.
If that picture's true, then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.
Well, they do change in strength.
Many other things that the LHC could discover.
The universe continued to expand and cool.
On at least one, and maybe only one of those planets, primitive life evolved, which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania, and eventually left a footprint on another world.
I started my journey in California with a UC Berkley 30-year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life.
When they're born, babies continue to smile -- initially, mostly in their sleep.
A recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden found that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles.
In a related German study, researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles.
And if that's not enough, smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others.
Rather, it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget I had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something.
But I told him no, I'm sorry, compromise in colors is gray, and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime.
To the first question, 63 percent of people said yes, we like it.
We established a green tax, and then everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly.
It's not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience.
They take it for granted that, come what may, people have to follow them, while politics, more and more, fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the exigencies of the common people.
It is about how people think, how they view the world around them, how they use their time and their energy.

For those of us on the ground in those early days, it was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans that Haiti was something different.
Back in Haiti, people were increasingly turning to the medium of SMS.
We didn't need to talk to the whole country at the same time.
Kibera is one of Africa's largest slums.
You can find out about the health centers.
And if people are migrating into urban, unfamiliar, concrete environments, they can also be helped in anticipation with social supporters ready and waiting for them based on SMS knowledge.
The collective voices of people needs to be more integrated through new technologies into the organizational strategies and plans of actions and not just recycled for fundraising or marketing.
We now have the tools. We now have the possibilities.
For a shower, I walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym.
They're both stories, interpretations.
It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness, the victories and the disappointments, but it's because how because of these, and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these, we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves.
And that's not all.
Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.
Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter.
I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me.
It cannot be stored.
My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take, that time can't be fought, and because it will pass and it will move, we owe the present moment our full attention.
Thank you.
But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window.
So, this woman, who converted from the Church of England to Catholicism when she married my father -- and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert -- decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria, particularly among Igbo women, the Billings ovulation method, which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church.
This woman -- during the Biafran war, we were caught in the war.
And she said, "You know, you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble, any kind of horror.
Did you also know that after apartheid, when the new government went into the parliament houses, there were no female toilets in the building?
Which sort of made me feel good, because he'd seen a lot of things.
And afterwards, he didn't say a word.
But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back, so he summoned me up, and he said, "Go into the bedroom, my bedroom.
There were some really bad people there.
They would knock down the shrine, and they would stop saying the god's name.
I imagine an old man crying here, out of the sight of the overseer.
All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy.
When enough stars come out, they create a galaxy.
So almost all life on Earth is wiped out about five times.
There were only about 2,000 of our species left.
We found another one last month.
Difference human/Neanderthal is sperm and testis, smell and skin.
And if you want to get more specific, how about a 577R genotype?
And we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States, except that with the technologies that are coming online today, today's corrections, deletions, augmentations and enhancements are going to seem like child's play.
Unless, of course, if you have a ski lift.
But in essence what he said is you can take retroviruses, which get inside brain cells of mice.
Here's the kind of questions that are becoming interesting questions for philosophers, for governing people, for economists, for scientists.
What we do know is, potentially, the brain is reacting in a hyperactive, hyper-plastic way, and creating individuals that are like this.
There's beginning to be some evidence that obesity and diet have something to do with gene modifications, which may or may not have an impact on how the brain of an infant works.
But when you see an increase of that order of magnitude in a condition, either you're not measuring it right or there's something going on very quickly, and it may be evolution in real time.
So this weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound.
And when that happens there's moment that causes this robot to roll.
So it turns out, the inertia, which governs angular motion, scales as a fifth power of R.
And it shows you how robust the control is.
So you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads.
So to remind you of physics, you have position, derivative, velocity, then acceleration, and then comes jerk and then comes snap.
It also tells the robot where these obstacles are.
So one of the disadvantages of these small robots is its size.
So what I want to show you next is a video of 20 of these little robots flying in formation.
So once you know how to fly in formation, you can actually pick up objects cooperatively.
So all these experiments you've seen thus far, all these demonstrations, have been done with the help of motion capture systems.
So the robot then figures out what the features are.
And there are many applications of this technology.
Let's watch.
Many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing, not just dying, but they're gone.
It's on the rooftop, right on the corner there, and it's been there for a couple of years now.
The urban honey is delicious.
Perhaps there's more pollen in the city.
Many of us will remember our childhood growing up, maybe you got stung by a bee, you saw bees on flowers.
And it worked out that way.
I spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines with needles. Like, years, years at the bench, "Oh my gosh, it's 3 a.m.
Honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there.
So this is important.
Try to understand that bees are very important.
I didn't know this word until I arrived.
This is an image from Tuscany, where we feel agriculture is still about beauty.
Of course, the reality is quite different.
And it means that you now eat products, which can come from all around the world.
Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics.
That is, historically, a really unique situation.
But this is now this strange concoction of high calories.
And this is where I have to query all of you.
It's a luxury solution for us who can afford it, if you want to afford it.
That need for animal protein is going to continue.
We must feed three billion people in cities.
And the ultimate may be, but it doesn't apply to cereals, that we have entirely closed ecosystems -- the horticultural systems right at the top left-hand corner.
We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to.
There are all kinds of ways we can do it.
You must go back and think about your own food chain.
We need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive.
Eat it, and feel privileged.
So being a mechanical engineer, being at MIT and having lots of resources available to me, I thought I'd try to do something about it.
How do you make a mountain bike for your arms that doesn't have the mountain bike cost and complexity?
Because those bicycle parts are so ubiquitously available, they're super-cheap.
Now the second lesson that we learned in this is that the constraints on this design really push the innovation, because we had to hit such a low price point, because we had to make a device that could travel on many, many types of terrain but still be usable indoors, and be simple enough to repair, we ended up with a fundamentally new product, a new product that is an innovation in a space that really hasn't changed in a hundred years.
That's where you can take a guy like me, an academic, but analyze and test and create a new technology and quantitatively determine how much better the performance is.
Amos Winter: And thank you very much for having me today.
When I was a kid, growing up in New York, I was smitten by snakes, the same way most kids are smitten by tops, marbles, cars, trains, cricket balls.
You can almost hear the drums throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there.
And they didn't kill it. They called us to catch it.
In this case a rather strange and inexplicable activity happened over the last breeding season, wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra, didn't mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it.
Well, the king cobra is literally a keystone species in these rainforests.
It pours out millions of gallons every hour, and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people, and washes many, many babies, and of course feeds many, many animals, both domestic and wild, produces thousands of tons of rice.
It is an animal which has been on the Earth for just about 100 million years.
And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.
For example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008, there was this incredible die-off of gharial, in the Chambal River.
But Poolan Devi was one [of them]. Which actually Shekhar Kapur made an incredible movie, "The Bandit Queen," which I urge you to see.
So, we're not sure where this story is going to end, whether it's got a happy or sad ending.
During the die-off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action.
Namaste.
I look at it as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being.
And the guy who is working there with them, he's from Maharashtra, he said, "I think he's after the nusha."
And so it's not something -- happiness is not something you get, health is generally not something that you get.
And to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction, you're going to live longer, you're going to feel better, you're going to lose weight, and so on.
And what we found was that 99 percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease.
Everybody who smokes knows it's not good for you, and still 30 percent of Americans smoke -- 80 percent in some parts of the world. Why do people do it?
You'll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth, and "impotence" -- the headline is, "Impotent" -- it's not emphysema.
And these things occur within hours. This is a study: a high fat meal, and within one or two hours blood-flow is measurably less -- and you've all experienced this at Thanksgiving.
These are not election returns; these are the percentage of people who are overweight.
So, when you eat less fat, you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food.
And these are things like whole foods, or unrefined carbs: fruits, vegetables, whole wheat flour, brown rice, in their natural forms, are rich in fiber.
It also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers like breast, prostate and colon cancer.
Now, we're about to publish the first study looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer, and, in collaboration with Sloane-Kettering and with UCSF.
And finally, I said, I wonder if there's any relationship between how much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth, whichever group they happened to be in.
Friendship, altruism, compassion, service – all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures -- once you stop trying to see the differences, these are the things in our own self-interest, because they free us from our suffering and from disease.
So, these simple things that create intimacy are really healing, and even the word healing, it comes from the root "to make whole."
So I want to show you a clip of the film now.
I'm sorry.
Ed Ulbrich: That was a clip from "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."
It was deemed impossible.
Of course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry, and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either, because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store, you know -- we see his face constantly.
We basically put something together to get through the meeting.
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program.
And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies, his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen.
The state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture.
We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone.
Initially, we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '70s.
So, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject.
So, in the spirit of "The Great Unveiling" -- I had to do this -- I had to unveil something.
We went through this process, then, called retargeting.
And the blue hoods helped us with two things: one, we could easily erase their heads; and we also put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set.
And so here, you can see again, the chosen take.
And then this is what we called the "dead head," no reference to Jerry Garcia.
And if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity, and feel his intent coming through the eyes, then we would succeed.
The skin had to be absolutely accurate.
It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile, or a frustrated smile.
They already have four children beside them. You can see them.
And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle.
This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear.
We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people.
And the people can hold their heads up high.
And they brought quite a bit of this stuff.
What I'm here to talk about is the camel.
And eventually, our worst nightmare happened: they flooded the engine.
And you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel.
And if Richard thought I was getting in the ring with that camel, someone was smoking Bedouin high grade.
When they're in rut -- they're similar to seals in the way, like, a seal has to open its nose to breathe.
They don't. They store fat.
I don't know why that would be, but it works for them.
I'm guessing that he -- well, he's at least 1,600 pounds.
Well -- and you're glad I didn't show you this.
So I'm going to show you another film.
Ogden Nash once wrote: "the camel has a single hump; the dromedary two, or else the other way around. I'm never sure. Are you?"
Able to pack up to 400 lbs.
My dung is burned as fuel. My milk is used for cheese.
I'm here to give you your recommended dietary allowance of poetry.
And the poem, if it's written with the ear, already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed.
And my sense is, it's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves and more into public life.
Writing is not actually as easy as that for me.
Narration: "Some Days."
I lived in New York City.
Who could sleep that night?
The dead are always looking down on us, they say.
If it has a subject, the subject is adolescence.
But then she was beheaded, so never mind her as a role model.
And what is interesting about him in relation to morality is that he lived at a time where religion's influence was waning, and he was sort of wondering, I think, what would happen with society if there was no religion or if there was less religion.
Now in the process of doing all this work on power and dominance and aggression and so on, I discovered that chimpanzees reconcile after fights.
But the principle is exactly the same.
What you have here is two young chimpanzees who have a box, and the box is too heavy for one chimp to pull in.
He takes basically everything.
Another problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus that is too heavy for a single elephant.
There they are.
They develop several of these alternative techniques that we did not approve of necessarily.
One is the body channel.
Humans yawn when others yawn.
And that's related to that whole body channel of synchronization that underlies empathy and that is universal in the mammals basically.
And they have to pick one of the two colors.
So it doesn't matter whatsoever.
And so this became a very famous study.
And if you give both of them cucumber for the task, the two monkeys side-by-side, they're perfectly willing to do this 25 times in a row.
So she gives a rock to us. That's the task.
So this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here.
So let me summarize.
So here's his first follower with a crucial role; he's going to show everyone else how to follow.
So first, if you are the type, like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone, remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it's clearly about the movement, not you.
I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation, hopefully for a good cause, which is self-improvement.
But after that, I decided to work on the spirit.
I got both of them.
And they were telling me all the things I had to do.
And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house, because those are just orgies of germs.
So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple.
And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over.
So they think it's actually very deadly.
But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food.
So thank you very much.
This is the amino acid tryptophan.
When this happened, a part of me thought, well, what's the big deal?
I have to say, this sounds awesome.
So this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image.
The headline? "You Love Your iPhone. Literally."
Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group at the expense of other groups.
Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business.
If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it, don't just take them at their word.
Now imagine archeologists digging through the rubble of one of our cities.
It occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers, covering what is now Pakistan, Northwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran.
We don't know.
So how big do you think that is?
You might wonder what these objects contain in terms of their text.
And to make matters even worse, most of the text that we have are extremely short.
And so it was then that I realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists, and so I jumped at that opportunity.
Oh, it's almost 50/50. Okay.
Now if I asked you to predict one more letter, what do you think that would be?
And the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other.
And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction.
You might have encountered the stuck-key problem -- so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again.
We found that the Indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts.
They were found in present day Iraq and Iran.
That's our next big challenge.
There could be other solutions.
In Dravidian languages, the word for fish is "meen" which happens to sound just like the word for star.
Today, we can write a word such as TED in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script, because both of these were deciphered in the 19th century.
I can't wait to find out.
This is the planet Jupiter.
So today, I'm going to tell you a short story of the history of the universe through listening.
But going from slinging some wire across rooftops in Boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the Atlantic Ocean seabed is no easy matter.
Fifty years on from Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun, Jansky's careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration: the radio astronomy age.
Now this didn't make any sense, and like any reasonable engineer or scientist, they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself, it must be the dish.
Thank you.
And as soon as they had laid all these, all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India, he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium, the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.
It just becomes intolerable.
You know, someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that's OK because you're in a theater, but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you, you'd freak out.
Luckily, they say -- I still am not sure -- but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the Buddhist literature, they say, "Oh who would really want to be compassionate?
I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time, doing it by having a good time.
But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion is that it is more fun.
She scared us with the lava man is coming, then the tsunami is coming, but then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful.
So then you decide, "Well, I'm sick of myself.
This is Birhan, who was the Ethiopian girl who launched Live Aid in the 1980s, 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued, and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world.
What these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths, across all continents -- a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others, and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted, see injuries that need to be corrected, see problems that need to be rectified.
We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet, but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with; and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history, and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society.
In Philippines in 2001, President Estrada -- a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime, eventually brought it down and it was, of course, called the "coup de text."
He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain, the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid.
Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem, where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that, when we want to create a global carbon market, but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem?
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone.
Take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world.
Tortured to death.
But it is said that in Ancient Greece when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences, people turned to each other and didn't say "Great speech."
It's not quite the TED Prize, but it is an exclusive t-shirt from our lab.
How do you do this?
The foot is distributed along the whole leg.
And the next behavior I'll show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it.
In 1951, Escher made this drawing. He thought he created an animal fantasy.
Watch where the robot, now, contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain.
Did you notice something?
And where they have a problem with this kind of mesh, because they don't have spines.
Well, here's RHex: RHex has trouble on rails -- on smooth rails, as you see here.
But look at this animal do it!
And here's the simple version of a foot for a new robot that I'll show you in a bit.
That pad comes out. And that's where the glue is.
Now we have something better here.
And each hair has the worst case of split ends possible.
You could think of a thousand possible uses, I'm sure.
So we've redefined, now, what a foot is.
But we think we got the dynamics right of the robot.
Here you see it, next, going up the side of a building at Stanford.
And what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world and also to stay in touch with one another.
This is a plot of frequency against time -- sort of like musical notation, where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower, and time goes this way.
Many mammals have to produce contact calls when, say, a mother and calf are apart.
Most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around.
And what's happened is they've used this learning process to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group.
And two boats: When the second boat was added, what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely.
But I'd also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think.
So blue whales and fin whales produce very low-frequency sounds that can travel over very long ranges.
But in '96 they heard a few weird songs, and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales.
That's shown down here.
The most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean comes from shipping.
Now think about it. This is an amazing thing: That in this frequency range where whales communicate, the main source globally, on our planet, for the noise comes from human ships, thousands of human ships, distant, far away, just all aggregating.
I'll play the sound of a contact call used by right whales to stay in touch.
Same thing in the North Atlantic, in the '50s versus 2000.
In terms of the shipping noise, the International Maritime Organization of the United Nations has formed a group whose job is to establish guidelines for quieting ships, to tell the industry how you could quiet ships.
The first case comes from the Bay of Fundy.
They've evolved over tens of millions of years to take advantage of this.
It's going to change the way we do astronomy, it's going to change the way we teach astronomy and I think most importantly it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe.
We see black holes at the heart of our galaxy, in the Milky Way, and elsewhere in the universe, where time itself seems to stand still.
Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope, I just want to leave you with this brief thought: when I ask people, "How does the night sky make you feel?"
And the tours are all totally interactive, so that if I were to go somewhere ...
So today, I want us to reflect on the demise of guys.
And as you all know, boys are five times more likely than girls to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder -- and therefore we drug them with Ritalin.
They don't know what to say, they don't know what to do, especially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex.
For every 400 movies made in Hollywood, there are 11,000 now made porn videos.
I'm really, really excited to be here today, because I'm about to show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab, literally, and I'm really glad that you guys are going to be amongst the first to be able to see it in person, because I really, really think this is going to change -- really change -- the way we interact with machines from this point on.
So, for instance, we have a lava lamp application here. Now, you can see, I can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze together and put the blobs together. I can inject heat into the system here, or I can pull it apart with two of my fingers.
But what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers, I can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily.
And I can bring that around, put that up there.
Jeff Han: I'm a research scientist at NYU in New York.
But as you can see, I can use the same two-fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly. There's no interface, again.
Now, here's a simple application here -- I can draw out a curve.
But it's imperative that we listen because it's undeniable and definitive.
What we don't agree on is what the problem actually is.
Then we were victims of the French.
We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims.
But it doesn't.
Let's think about Mexican streets: they're unsafe because of violence, so people stay at home.
They say, "I can't take it anymore.
It means it's determined and effective, but not violent.
These heroic acts are present all over the country.
When we thought Masiosare was the strange enemy, and we sang, with a childlike heart, "a soldier in each son."
Today in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis.
The battle is won, but we still have to fight it.
Well, I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about.
Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented -- but using the rhythm of my body and feet, and controlling the balls with my feet.
Thanks. So, visual music: rhythm and complexity.
Or you can go back and change the height. Now, skill.
Make it faster and smaller.
Now, do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow.
What you're going to learn is this.
Now, one more time, and -- finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open.
So, we're going to start off looking at the white ball -- and I'm going to tell you which color, and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK?
Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life?
Now, I'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that I've developed. OK?
A moment -- no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together.
Hup. Now, it's dependent on rhythm, and keeping a center of balance. When it falls, going underneath.
Which is again exploring space, or the lines in space.
Sometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that way that I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this.
They're not ideas, they're instincts.
Now, I don't know exactly where it's going, but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing.
There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world and at IDEO this past year, and I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you.
This year -- maybe you could show the slides -- this year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with and helped Handspring design it.
Then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas.
There's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around -- but there's a three second delay.
And the topics include things that the museum is about: male fertility, choosing the sex of your baby or what a driverless car might be like.
Though they work in a wide-open office space spectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge, the team built their own little cubicles to fully experience the problems.
And my favorite feature, which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment, and then when you come back, it comes up to greet you, happy to see you.
And then, if you saw, the panels actually rotate. So you can get the information on the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual recycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water.
And the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool.
ApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher, who's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford.
And so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing -- she's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things.
In fact, if you look really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic substructure of matter, there isn't anything there.
After her name, written in brackets was the apt description, horse face.
Gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand.
But we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing.
I'm an ignostic.
The stars by day. I always think that's fascinating.
Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three, which is great news for psychoanalysts, because otherwise they'd be out of a job.
What are we? What is this thing that we hang on, that is actually us?
100 billion. How many can we see? Five.
It is incredible how little we know.
He was a cheerful bastard wasn't he?
Jean-Baptiste Michel: So how did we get to this conclusion?
So it turns out there was a company across the river called Google who had started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach.
Now when Google digitizes a book, they put it into a really nice format.
Now we're thinking, what data can we release?
That gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time.
So the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide.
Through the 30s and 40s, no one cared.
And because we have these nice charts, we can measure things.
So here you will become famous by the end of your 50s, and become very, very famous afterward.
If you look in German, you see something completely bizarre, something you pretty much never see, which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets, going through a nadir between 1933 and 1945, before rebounding afterward.
If it's very large, maybe you're benefiting from propaganda.
EL So culturomics is what we call this method.
So in two weeks flat -- the two weeks before our paper came out -- they coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public.
Google has started to digitize 15 million books.
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear.
We listen to differences, we discount sounds that remain the same.
Sound places us in space and in time.
The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared.
And that means it's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet, the subtle, the understated.
Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again.
It's about enjoying mundane sounds.
If you're in any one of those roles -- and I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk -- the acronym is RASA, which is the Sanskrit word for juice or essence.
So I invite you to connect with me, connect with each other, take this mission out and let's get listening taught in schools, and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world -- a world of connection, a world of understanding and a world of peace.
And their eyes would say, "Nobody ever sees me. Thank you."
This was me on piano, a genius drummer.
And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in, and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death.
This is this.
I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get themselves some extra money, something that I did a lot.
And it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies in the first few weeks, and the label considers this a failure.
It's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists.
This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin.
I see them as trust.
From the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine, the rooftops of Kenya to the favelas of Rio, paper and glue -- as easy as that.
This is Inside Out.
These are the people I want to talk about to you today.
Karachi, Pakistan.
Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers and covered the entire border.
Come on, don't tell me that people aren't ready for peace out there.
Thank you.
And I've done this because I really believe that mobile computing is the future of personal computing, and I'm trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things.
And one might have the impression that we really knew a lot about brains.
First, I went to MIT, the AI lab was there, and I said, well, I want to build intelligent machines, too, but the way I want to do it is to study how brains work first.
I was very depressed. I said, but I can make a difference in this field.
Why do we study ants? Well, it's interesting.
And people have been working on it for 100 years.
We don't need more data -- we need a good theory about it.
Some people say, brains can't understand brains.
And so, if some people have fallen into the pit of metaphysical dualism, some really smart people, too, but we can reject all that.
It just turns out it's really hard to think of things, but once you've thought of them, it's kind of easy to understand it.
Evolution's the same thing. We taught our kids, well, the Bible says, you know, God created all these species, cats are cats, dogs are dogs, people are people, plants are plants, they don't change.
Engineers like to look at systems like this. Scientists like to look at systems like this.
Maybe you're scratching yourself, or picking your nose, I don't know, but you're not doing anything right now, but you're being intelligent; you're understanding what I'm saying.
It can attack. It can do all kinds of stuff.
And it's this feeding back into the old brain that'll allow you to make very more intelligent decisions.
So let me give you a few examples of predictions.
And as you go up to the door, you know, let's check them off one at time.
And so when you look at someone's face, you'd typically go from eye to eye to eye to nose to mouth.
So what is the recipe for brain theory?
Anyone who gets up and tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn't tell you exactly how it's working in the brain and how the wiring works in the brain, it is not a theory.
A song must be heard in sequence over time, and you must play it back in sequence over time.
But they're very different types of memories.
I'm actually here to make a challenge to people.
And I am not a complete pacifist like some of my really, really heavy-duty, non-violent friends, like Mairead McGuire.
I certainly support the START vote.
It is all of those things.
We need that in the world.
She is already out in the streets, working with the party to try to rebuild it.
She says the airports of the world.
People could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail.
That's what I got stuck doing -- the landmine campaign.
And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.
Let me, let me push the button."
And yet, in the world, there are so many people who still heat the water on fire, and they cook their food on fire.
Or, to be more precise, how do most of the women in the world wash?
But when I lecture to environmentally-concerned students, they tell me, "No, everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines."
Look here, you see the seven billion people up there: the air people, the wash people, the bulb people and the fire people.
But the main concern for the environmentally-interested students -- and they are right -- is about the future.
Of course they must be more energy-efficient.
If you have democracy, people will vote for washing machines.
She loved this. I got the "ABC's" -- this is where I started my career as a professor, when my mother had time to read for me.
I would like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving Adam and Eve, and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past 10 years.
Back in the year 2000, about 100 billion photos were shot worldwide, but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online.
Well, the computer did, and in fact did so for one out of three subjects.
In fact, take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme.
Now you may be thinking, this does not apply to me, because I have nothing to hide.
One of these mechanisms is transparency, telling people what you are going to do with their data.
But then we added the misdirection.
The way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done, and certainly not the best way they can be done.
You can find echoes of this interpretation in John Milton's "Paradise Lost."
We get to play Angry Birds. We get targeted apps.
Thank you.
And I was like, "Get a room. I don't want to see this."
We sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up, and what they really lacked was social trust.
They get picked up by these creatures I've called uber-moms, who are highly successful career women who have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard.
They get into competitive colleges, they get good jobs, and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a superficial manner, and they make a ton of money.
And as they whiz by you, it's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet going up the hill.
One of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists, people named Lawrence become lawyers, because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar, which is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks.
Now I'm a middle-aged guy.
We're social animals, not rational animals.
And this work corrects that bias in our culture, that dehumanizing bias.
Babies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind and to download what they find -- their models of how to understand reality.
They are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence.
And the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group; it's determined by how well they communicate, how often they take turns in conversation.
The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige.
And all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed, 'That's me. That's me.' And those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before, about the fusion of our souls into one higher-level entity, about the fact that at the core of both our souls lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children, about the notion that those hopes were not separate or distinct hopes, but were just one hope, one clear thing that defined us both, that welded us into a unit -- the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children.
I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery.
All that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally.
My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager.
Where does their journey begin?
But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it, substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.
When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had was where do I begin.
She is an illiterate girl, trained, skilled as a welder.
I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.
And then she says, "Not one of our girls."
They need your compassion.
I'm asking you, in your limited world, can you open your minds? Can you open your hearts?
You know, in a dictionary? Yeah, that's what I thought.
And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun, you kind of look for an excuse not to do them.
So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.
I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.
This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.
And when you improve searchability, you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.
So, it's not that we have good words and bad words.
How can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.
What if biologists could only study animals that made people go, "Aww." Right?
But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic, but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.
And I'm not even talking about polysemy, which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves.
I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.
But even if it were, rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days. You know?
I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.
They show the word, but they don't show any context.
They use it synecdochically.
This is what dictionaries used to look like.
I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law -- ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever.
And I think what disgusts me more than anything, looking back, is how the hell did I let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing?
And what was really most exciting -- and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did -- was that all this stuff is connected.
You can view it as a computing problem, an artificial intelligence problem: do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly?
it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage.
That's not going to be changed at all.
They may well be by a TED speaker, and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey.
Titus was a restaurant manager.
He lost his fiancée.
and I say "I study memory," they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names, or they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's or some kind of memory problem, but I have to tell them I don't study when people forget.
But decades of work in psychology has shown that this just isn't true.
And you might be thinking, well, you know, these are filmed events, they are not particularly stressful.
Some patients were going into therapy with one problem -- maybe they had depression, an eating disorder -- and they were coming out of therapy with a different problem.
You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person and reunited with the family.
But probably the worst was I suspected that a woman was innocent of abuse that was being claimed by her grown daughter.
Our first study planted a false memory that you got sick as a child eating certain foods: hard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.
Such a discovery has made me more tolerant of the everyday memory mistakes that my friends and family members make.
Instantaneously, every civilian GPS receiver around the globe went from errors the size of a football field to errors the size of a small room.
For some time now, it's been known that if you pay attention to the carrier phase of the GPS signal, and if you have an Internet connection, then you can go from meter level to centimeter level, even millimeter-level positioning.
Here's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot, which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe, but we know that in the world of nonfiction, the GPS dot is impossible, right?
I should be able to ask my house where my shoes are.
Every time her ex-boyfriend would show up, at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations, he was carrying an open laptop, and over time Carol realized that he had planted a GPS tracking device on her car, so she was calling me for help to disable it.
So, there we were.
Chinese manufacturers now sell thousands of nearly identical devices on the Internet.
Instead of jamming the GPS signals, you fake them.
Well, the short answer is yes.
Here's Ramon — — looking for a little attention from Dad that week.
What I then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos.
We simply cannot tolerate GPS jammers and spoofers, and yet, given the lack of effective legal means for protecting our privacy from the GPS dot, can you really blame people for wanting to turn them on, for wanting to use them?
It'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out.
And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle, I made him "The Uncle Phone."
The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call "The Pygmies."
And we made them react to people, but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.
It's a very early video, so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that, but that got refined pretty soon, later.
His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts, that it's sort of fallen into his hat, and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.
And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall, because if we made it in a way that it would topple over, then it would damage itself, and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism, or that sense of wanting to go and help it.
So this is the last work, and a work in progress, and it's called "Space Filler."
So those who are "yes," raise your hand. "For."
A classic example is James Hansen, a NASA climatologist pushing for 350 parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
This is one of the most desired things by poor people all over the world, in the cities and in the countryside.
The power lines are getting overloaded.
We have been taking down the Russian warheads, turning it into electricity.
Here is a commercial version from New Mexico called the Hyperion, and another one from Oregon called NuScale.
Mark Jacobson: Thank you.
And this is just the CO2 from the life cycle.
So if you add these two together, alone, you can see a separation that nuclear puts out at least nine to 17 times more CO2 equivalent emissions than wind energy.
North Korea did that to some extent.
That would take between one and three square kilometers of footprint on the ground, entirely.
We want to match the hour-by-hour power supply.
And we can guarantee a clean, blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power.
Of those, seven have nuclear weapons.
You can make it reliable, as I showed with that diagram.
I used to be against nuclear power.
Be very aware of the propaganda.
I've got solar PV on my roof.
We need a solution that generates all of the time.
Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel.
Fifteen percent of the entire U.S.
Ooooh.
My name is Eric Li, and I was born here.
But before we get there, we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil, the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism, and the good shall triumph.
As if one big story wasn't enough, I was told another one.
George W. Bush: ... ending tyranny in our world ...
In just 30 years, China went from one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world to its second-largest economy.
It won't last long because it cannot adapt.
But this claim is a rhetorical trap hidden behind a political bias.
China's highest ruling body, the Politburo, has 25 members.
They form separate yet integrated career paths for Chinese officials.
Throughout their careers, these cadres can move through and out of all three tracks.
China's new president, Xi Jinping, is the son of a former leader, which is very unusual, first of his kind to make the top job.
Now, Westerners always assume that multi-party election with universal suffrage is the only source of political legitimacy.
Those who expect the future to be better: a whopping 82 percent.
India, the largest democracy in the world, 94 and dropping.
Economic reform will accelerate, political reform will continue, and the one-party system will hold firm.
It cannot be exported. But that is the point precisely.
Thank you.
Not just from the central government, the city government, the provincial government, to the most local neighborhood districts.
But then you've just mentioned other elements like, you know, big challenges, and there are, of course, a lot of other data that go in a different direction: tens of thousands of unrests and protests and environmental protests, etc.
You know, it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy, a chance to, if you would, back up the biosphere.
Some images from Mars, 1997.
But I put forward here, the government is not going to get us there.
The difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key.
Let's go back to high school physics here.
Today, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar of their own money in R&amp;D.
We offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship, carry three people up to 100 kilometers, come back down, and within two weeks, make the trip again.
No one believed it was done. Everyone said, "Oh, what does NASA think?
Isn't that great?
And turns out 7-Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month.
Then, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving, you get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability.
Well, it must be a good idea.
So my final slide here is, the most critical tool for solving humanity's grand challenges -- it isn't technology, it isn't money, it's only one thing -- it's the committed, passionate human mind.
She was rushed to hospital, but it was too late. She died.
Does it really matter that we're not walking past them in the street?
It's important because it combines both the heart and the head.
That's the understanding, the rational understanding of our situation in the world that has led to these people being the most effective altruists in history, Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.
He became an effective altruist when he calculated that with the money that he was likely to earn throughout his career, an academic career, he could give enough to cure 80,000 people of blindness in developing countries and still have enough left for a perfectly adequate standard of living.
Many people will think, though, that charities aren't really all that effective.
I think it's clear what's the better thing to do.
Possibly research could help us not only to predict the path of asteroids that might collide with us, but actually to deflect them.
I think one of the reasons for this is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome what I call the Sisyphus problem.
This is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery.
So if you're feeling bad because you still have two kidneys as well, there's a way for you to get off the hook.
I propose we look to nature.
Now, we can take this form and use the same process to generate three-dimensional structures, but rather than folding things by hand, we'll bring the structure into the computer, and code it as an algorithm.
In general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio, which is what you're seeing here, then the form changes correspondingly.
These forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one.
And these columns, they have information at very many scales.
There's no randomness involved at all, but it's not entirely predictable.
There's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing.
It took me several months to design the column, but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces.
I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object, but a process to generate objects.
But look what happened in the course of that century.
What's a drug? A drug is made up of a small molecule of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and a few other atoms all cobbled together in a shape, and it's those shapes that determine whether, in fact, that particular drug is going to hit its target.
How can we make this go faster?
The bad news is, this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis, and it won't work for Danny, and we're still waiting for that next generation to help him.
Let me show you a video of what that does to the cell.
Sam is 15 years old. His parents, Scott Berns and Leslie Gordon, both physicians, are here with us this morning as well.
Please join me in thanking and welcoming Sam.
That could be a phenomenal, valuable activity.
It just started last December, and this is one of its goals.
What do we need to capitalize on this? First of all, we need resources.
If you don't believe me, just ask Sam.
Instead, she felt more free, more free because she could wear whatever she wanted under the abaya.
In fact, research has shown that the more the world is flat, if I use Tom Friedman's analogy, or global, the more and more people are wanting to be different.
And I'm sure, although we can't see the people in Washington, they are in the same position.
I want to ask you, why do you think this is?
Ask the chairpersons and CEOs of Sotheby's and Christie's.
She does that through important visual forms of photography and film.
Today I am proud to say we have trained and educated over 66 Qatari women filmmakers to edit, tell their own stories in their own voices.
Girl: Women! One word and they get upset.
They're learning our culture, our language, our heritage and realizing we're just as different and just the same as each other.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Shokran.
What made me do it? At school, I will admit this: academically, I couldn't express myself.
And all of a sudden ...
And as I looked down on the ground, I noticed there was some ants running around.
And so they did.
So I say, "How are you going to fit in there?"
So I did.
So I'm thinking "How can I do this?"
And it went like this ...
And the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed.
I think they're arguing about the space on the pin.
Whenever you work on that level, things behave different.
So after I've done the same thing, then I have to paint it.
As you can see, that's Charlton Heston brought down to size.
And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber, which I took out of the air.
I had a 24-karat gold ring.
That one took me approximately six weeks.
So I wanted to have that little image.
And that's how I managed to do it.
And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.
I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view, and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion.
After many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle, he comes back.
But don't ignore what you've asked them to do.
That is a moment which is a gift of God to us -- a gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on "I, I, I, me, me, me," and instead, like the person in Rumi's story, we say, "Oh, this is all you.
Through our subconscious, in your dreams -- the Koran calls our state of sleep "the lesser death," "the temporary death" -- in our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions, we travel even outside of our bodies, for many of us, and we see wonderful things.
And these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human.
And I believe, personally, that we're on the verge and that, with the presence and help of people like you here, we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah.
That's why they were called ape hangers.
In fact, I made a living by walking.
I crumbled.
And I said to myself I would call this group of men "the Council of Dads."
I said, "Look, in Georgia at least we want to know.
And the first one was no family, only friends.
And the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin.
And we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter.
Approach the cow."
Only a hundred adults a year get one of these diseases.
And I hung up the phone, and I put my face in my hands, and I screamed this silent scream.
When my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck.
And one night my daughter Eden came to me.
And no one captures this modern manhood to me more than David Black.
And I said, "What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?"
We set out on crutches.
At the risk of admission, I was never nicer than the year I was on crutches.
And every seven sets of seven years, the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love.
And I just want to mention briefly in passing -- I'm past my time limit -- but I just want to briefly mention in passing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is, at a similar meeting, back in the spring, Anne Wojcicki heard about our story and very quickly -- in a span of three weeks -- put the full resources of 23andMe, and we announced an initiative in July to get to decode the genome of anybody, a living person with a heart tissue, bone sarcoma.
It's amazing now, because he's so much bigger than me, but when Derek was born, he could have fitted on the palm of your hand.
But Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it, bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break.
DP: "English Country Garden."
As you can see, there's me in my early, pre-marriage days with a brown beard, and little Derek concentrating there.
And so whenever you heard any note at all -- if I just play a random note -- -- you knew instantly what it was, and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano.
It's no use having that kind of raw ability without the technique, and luckily, Derek, you decided that, once we did start learning, you'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings.
So if I just choose a note at random, like that one.
Derek's going to L.A. soon, and it's a milestone, because it means that Derek and I will have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together, which is quite interesting, isn't it Derek?
DP: Somebody played "Chopsticks" like this. AO: Just teasing, right? Here we go.
AO: -- who also was a pianist who couldn't see, and also, I think, like Derek, thought that all the world was a piano, so whenever Art Tatum plays something, it sounds like there's three pianos in the room.
It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located, of course, at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design, the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously, the much better access to parking.
And despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey-ness and tripodism, it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts.
Does anyone know? Chi?
And yet I forget about it all the time.
Good morning everyone. First of all, it's been fantastic being here over these past few days.
Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film, but these beings have voices that mean something.
So in many, many ways, we can do things today that we couldn't do when I began in 1960.
And the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward, like one raisin for a correct response -- but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand.
We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.
And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism.
They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.
They shoot everything, every single thing that moves that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it.
Were the people that we heard about yesterday, on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid?
And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight, the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected, and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world, and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense, hope lies in sense, you said -- it's making a nonsense.
There's little brochures all around outside, and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future, I beg that you pick up that brochure.
So, the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects.
It's going to depend on which country they're in -- and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups -- and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves.
Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying, "Look at the difference we've made."
So how do we solve?
And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact, not just because you can share technology with us, but because so many of you have children.
We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life.
Over the last hundred and fifty years or so, science has kind of blurred this distinction between non-living and living systems, and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists between the two.
Life also has a kind of inheritable information.
"If we accept the theory of evolution, then the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist in the production of forms intermediate between the inorganic and the organic world, or between the non-living and living world, forms which possess only some of the rudimentary attributes of life" -- so, the ones I just discussed -- "to which other attributes will be slowly added in the course of development by the evolutionary actions of the environment."
So that's just forming some body stuff, right?
So just through self-assembly, mixing things together in the lab, we can come up with, say, a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body, right?
It's a pool of water, and the protocell starts moving itself around in the system.
It can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself.
The second protocell has a different chemistry inside, and when activated, the protocells all come together and they fuse into one big one. Right?
If you let that go unregulated, you'll continue to make and break chemical bonds, forming an even more diverse mixture of molecules that then forms this kind of black tarry stuff in your pan, right, that's difficult to wash out. So that's what the origin of life would have looked like.
These are very dirty little protocells, as a matter of fact.
This is similar to having the Sun shining on the Earth, driving photosynthesis, driving the ecosystem.
And what it is -- it's a twist on health.
So all of those -- what's common about all of those?
So an impatient concern for water quality would raise a tadpole bureaucrat in a sample of water in which they're interested.
The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole, observing the behavioral and developmental events, you will then go and introduce your tadpole to its namesake and discuss the evidence that you've seen.
This is one of them.
Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality, or to understand it or to change it, the benefits are enjoyed by anyone you share that water quality or air quality with.
By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them, we don't prevent them from being used as emergency vehicle parking spaces, because, of course, a firetruck can come and park there.
And this is an interesting icon that happened -- you remember these: fallout shelters.
This is the quarter-scale prototype that was functioning in Spain.
When we put it through our solar chimney, we remove actually about 95 percent of that.
And every green space we create is an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us.
Natalie Jeremijenko: Okay.
Hence, you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them.
They're delicious.
And that's typically the paradigm under which we've operated.
And one of my favorites has always been, "Make love to your man in a Chevy van," because that was my vehicle when I was in college.
Cars are dramatically cleaner, dramatically safer, more efficient and radically more affordable than they were 100 years ago.
We then had Autonomy drivable with Hy-Wire, and we showed Hy-Wire here at this conference last year.
A lot of hydrogen's produced today in the world.
But the real exciting vision that we see truly is home refueling, much like recharging your laptop or recharging your cellphone.
Now, if you take the power-generating capability of an automobile and you compare that to the electric grid in the United States, it turns out that four percent of the automobiles, the power in four percent of the automobiles, equals that of the electric grid of the US.
We're into this over a billion dollars already, so I would hope people would think we're serious when we're spending that kind of money.
Everyone knew who I was, so I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected, and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail, I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.
I needed teachers, in the classroom, every day, who were going to say, "You can move beyond that."
You just had to do things sometimes.
So I began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that I attended, and I really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me.
How do you get to build those relationships?
And it was out of fear -- fear of, well, what if they get it wrong?
Animation, software, moviemaking software, they have it all.
Very few things went to the market.
We fought very hard against the dictatorship, in a moment it was necessary to us: Either go into clandestinity with weapons in hand, or leave Brazil. We were too young, and our organization thought it was better for us to go out, and we went to France, where I did a PhD in economics, Léila became an architect.
It became a book. It became a show.
What happened is, you saw so many deaths that you are dying.
When we received the land, it was less than half a percent rainforest, as in all my region.
We started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees, only local species, only native species, where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed, and the life started to come back in an incredible way.
I wished to photograph the other animals, to photograph the landscapes, to photograph us, but us from the beginning, the time we lived in equilibrium with nature.
This is what we must fight hard to hold like it is now.
Me, one minute, it's dry. The same with the trees.
But you see a lot of small spots in this picture.
We here inside the room, I believe that we have the same concern, and the model that we created in Brazil, we can transplant it here.
We're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609, when he sailed into New York harbor.
But every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City.
And it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George Washington Bridge goes across today.
And it's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide.
But they're also mapping things of ecological interest, also military interest: the hills, the marshes, the streams.
So, the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan, places that are close to water, places that are near the harbor to fish, places protected from the winter winds.
And 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis, Manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than Yosemite does, than Yellowstone, than Amboseli.
So we just started making a list.
And it need beavers to create the wetlands, and maybe some other things.
And those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together.
You can see this for yourself on our website.
Using this technology, we can make these fantastic georeferenced views.
And I'd just like, if you would give him a hand, to call out for his fine work.
So just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know?
And we, at the moment, in our society, have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this.
This is producing all sorts of tensions, all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing.
And all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet.
Well, Worldchanging you might think of as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future.
We're already an urban planet; that's especially true in the developed world.
They've bounded the city with a line.
When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them.
So we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in, and turn them into Bright Green cities.
Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging.
We've heard all about this here this week, so I won't say too much more than that, other than to say what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies.
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back.
You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out.
That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine there being a different, vague possibility out there, but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility.
Here's another one. This is from a game called "Food Force," which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp.
You get grassroots solutions, things that work for people who have no capital or limited access.
And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right?
Alex Steffen: Exactly, this is a landmine-detecting flower.
All that the human mind has accomplished is but the dream before the awakening."
They liked to draw the Little Mermaid, they'd like to draw a smurf, they'd like to draw Micky Mouse.
PIPA is short for PROTECTIP, which is itself short for Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property -- because the congressional aides who name these things have a lot of time on their hands.
Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill that won't accomplish its stated goals, but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects, you have to understand a little bit about the back story.
We don't really like to only consume.
Taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay.
And the main reason it hasn't worked is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful than anyone imagined.
You need to take them out of search engines, you need to take them out of online directories, you need to take them out of user lists.
The real effects of SOPA and PIPA are going to be different than the proposed effects.
If they break it, they will break it for everybody.
They don't want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing.
Thank you.
None of the work is my work. It's all work that my colleagues have done, and I actually asked them for their slides and incorporated them into this talk.
This is a defibrillator, and this is a device that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm, and these have saved many lives.
Now, they have two areas they can attack.
This is what their setup looks like for the first model, where you get to have access to the car.
The results are astonishing, and when they gave this talk, even though they gave this talk at a conference to a bunch of computer security researchers, everybody was gasping.
Am I scaring you yet?
This is what the phone looks like. It's not really a phone.
This is plain text. This is encrypted.
That one's pretty easy to fix.
They had pretty good success. This is an article from the USA Today.
I went to a very elitist, snobbish, expensive education in India, and that almost destroyed me.
Mother went into a coma.
"Dig wells for five years?
I said, "No."
So it's the only college in India where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's, you are disqualified to come.
A traditional bone setter is a professional.
You come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College.
So when I said that, they said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing?
But it actually doesn't leak.
Food, if you come to the Barefoot College, is solar cooked.
Very little water is wasted.
But all the schools are solar-lit.
Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening.
He actually raises money, solves my disputes.
Men are restless, men are ambitious, men are compulsively mobile, and they all want a certificate.
They said, "Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms, and you want to take them to India."
But their body language is great.
So he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?"
They said, "Why? She doesn't know the language. You don't know her."
She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran.
Don't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground.
Imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material.
And it's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful.
In this artistic and scientific installation, biogenerative algorithms are helping us to understand self-generation and growth: very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences.
The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration.
We've taken this information and we've made a mathematical model out of it.
What is it about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one?
I mean, you know, Ben and Jerry's doesn't have liver-and-onion ice cream, and it's not because they whipped some up, tried it and went, "Yuck."
And this is exactly what you expected, isn't it?
Because happiness can be synthesized.
We synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found.
He lost his money; he lost his power.
Well, in 1994, when Pete Best was interviewed -- yes, he's still a drummer; yes, he's a studio musician -- he had this to say: "I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles."
What are these terms?
It's very simple.
This is the result that has been replicated over and over again.
OK? They remember their childhood, but if you walk in and introduce yourself, and then leave the room, when you come back, they don't know who you are.
If I've met you before, I don't remember."
Normal controls show -- that was the magic I showed you; now I'm showing it to you in graphical form -- "The one I own is better than I thought. The one I didn't own, the one I left behind, is not as good as I thought."
But freedom to choose -- to change and make up your mind -- is the enemy of synthetic happiness.
Here's an experiment we did at Harvard.
In one case, the students are told, "But you know, if you want to change your mind, I'll always have the other one here, and in the next four days, before I actually mail it to headquarters, I'll be glad to" -- -- yeah, "headquarters" -- "I'll be glad to swap it out with you. In fact, I'll come to your dorm room and give -- just give me an email. Better yet, I'll check with you.
It's a very small increase, and it doesn't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition.
We could do it so that when you take the two pictures, you'd have four days to change your mind, or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it. Which course would you like to be in?"
This is worth contemplating: "The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another ...
By day, I'm a venture capitalist. On weekends, I love rockets.
They rumble the belly and leave even photographers in awe watching the spectacle.
Sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic.
Thank you.
"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went to the White House."
Camaguey is a province in Cuba.
I love that, but we don't have the time.
There's stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine.
And Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.
I called my mother, and she said, "Carmen, I need you to come, please.
There's a historical marker.
Issued, evidently, by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett.
Her daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream cone in the middle of her forehead, is still standing there, slack-jawed.
I mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert.
So, I think, hey, we can talk. It'll be a diversion.
"Would this guy have, like, a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face?"
He gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?"
"You mean, like, in the car?"
"It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?"
We're doing great. We're doing fine.
This is new and fast, just so you -- are you still with us?
When she writes the expose in about 20 years, don't believe a word of it.
Don't you want to look?
I don't know what part of the country you live in.
She is, after all, Cuban.
"Que?" Which means "what," and so much more.
Yeah, you can clap, but then you're about 30 seconds from the end.
And I turn to Esther, who's rocking on those 'ports, and says, "You know what, honey?"
It's not a movie. This is real life.
All those hours when a car is sitting idle, I'm not paying for it.
The social result is that today's Zipcar has 100,000 members driving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces.
It required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds to reserve a car, go get it, drive it.
How did you go food shopping? You went with your neighbor, what a great social time.
It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads.
And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go, because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes.
And in a mesh, every device contributes to and expands the network, and I think you might have heard a little bit about it before.
They mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals.
Are you guys ready again -- "The Graduate"?
What's the wireless technology we're going to use?
Imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero.
We could make billions of dollars on top of it, but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source.
We had close family, good friends, a quiet street.
I graduated from school, and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.
And it was a really heavy time.
And then I got a phone call, and the voice at the other end of the line said, "You've just won the Best Blog In the World award."
Over the last few years, I haven't had that much time to really think.
Your mom could get cancer, your dad could get mean.
I love the way that they see the world, because they're seeing the world for the first time.
And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.
He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him, it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.
You go places you've dreamt about.
I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.
And he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out."
I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.
We've got all that, but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.
And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.
To honor and remember.
David Rockwell: The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground.
How did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York -- felt on the 11th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing?
Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us.
And it wasn't an inclusive group.
The families -- the victims of the families -- were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.
There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience.
DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen.
DR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center, if that helps anyone -- volunteered to help.
DR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.
The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding.
One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable.
And Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller and all the people within the city -- Norman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding, offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it.
It enables that conversation to get serious.
Well, I think that's interesting.
And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city.
DR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west.
What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed, so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero, but all of the buildings around it -- and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous.
One of my girlfriends in graduate school, Marie, said, "Kim, I figured it out.
All right. "Starsky and Hutch," arguably, yes.
Would it be crazy to know, 103 Gs.
They're designed to recover from an injury.
What you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said, "Isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband is forever losing his keys?
She's totally not kidding."
The second is a resource I'm personally really proud of.
What's the budget for protective equipment?
I can't say no, but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid's wearing a helmet -- like to the car, or at school.
And additionally, there is a psychological aversion to doodling -- thank you, Freud.
And here's the truth: doodling is an incredibly powerful tool, and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn.
Now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it, we have to engage at least two of those modalities, or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience.
So here is my point: Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room.
They were not the only ones.
People in our countries here in Europe, in North America, were living with HIV, healthy lives.
Treatment programs became possible, funding became available, and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly.
Well, things have changed.
It can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies, for example.
He has access to antiretroviral drugs.
This has never been seen before.
Let me start with the aspect of comfort, because many people are confusing ambient temperature with thermal comfort.
What about Athens? Mediterranean climate, but in the sun it was not comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort.
Which is the driving parameter which gives me a perceived temperature? And these parameters, these climatic parameters are related to the human metabolism.
So we need to do something active.
Natural-watered lawn is a very good cooling source stabilizing temperature, and using dehumidified air to create comfort.
Thank you very much.
He runs a little shop in one of the back streets of Mumbai.
But what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering and know-how that's built into this little two meters of space.
It's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts and supplies that are produced all over the world, literally, and then redistributed to basically service this industry, and you can even buy salvaged parts.
It's taught [by] word of mouth, and it's an informal education system around this.
Can we make a little product or a service out of it?"
So we walked around.
We dismantle the whole thing, we reassemble it in a new configuration, and we do this hardware mashup, systematically training the guy how to do this.
So we said, "What can we do with the ASHA worker that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter, but not just a filter, a really well thought through referral system that allows load balancing of the network, and directs patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?"
So you're going to put your thumb on top of this.
Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually.
So we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the ASHA worker.
And I was observing what happened to people and their families over the course of their terminal illness.
And second, it was not restricted to pairs of people.
And how do they effect us?
It's not obvious exactly what's going on.
There can be many mechanisms for this effect: One possibility is that your friends say to you something like -- you know, they adopt a behavior that spreads to you -- like, they say, "Let's go have muffins and beer," which is a terrible combination.
Our next questions was: Could we actually visualize this spread?
You're going to see people be born and die -- dots will appear and disappear -- ties will form and break, marriages and divorces, friendings and defriendings.
Why do we show our emotions?
And they looked at me and said, "We don't do that in New York City."
Again, a social network, but now we color the people yellow if they're happy and blue if they're sad and green in between.
Why don't we form human social networks that look like a regular lattice?
Compare node B in the upper left to node A in the lower left.
And we think the reason for this is that some people like to introduce their friends to each other -- you know who you are -- and others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other.
So think about these two common objects.
Like, for example, a hive of bees that's finding a new nesting site, or a flock of birds that's evading a predator, or a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom and navigate and find a tiny speck of an island in the middle of the Pacific, or a pack of wolves that's able to bring down larger prey.
Thank you.
So if you ever feel like you don't have this aging thing quite pegged, don't kick yourself.
It's hardly time to rest on our laurels.
Now social scientists call this the paradox of aging.
Our participants would carry electronic pagers for a week at a time, and we'd page them throughout the day and evenings at random times.
We've said, well maybe older people report more positive emotions because they're cognitively impaired.
We might spend time with people we don't even like because it's somehow interesting.
We invest in more emotionally important parts of life, and life gets better, so we're happier day-to-day.

I grew up in a musical family.
Online videos and social networking ...
Ladies and gentlemen: The LXD.
It's kind of like this other level where you can't make choices anymore, and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music.
But on Pine Ridge, I will always be what is called "wasichu," and "wasichu" is a Lakota word that means "non-Indian," but another version of this word means "the one who takes the best meat for himself."
What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department, setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans.
In response, three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the U.S. army many times over.
1871: The Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government.
1876: On July 26th on its way to attack a Lakota village, Custer's 7th Cavalry was crushed at the battle of Little Big Horn.
Reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of.
To this day, this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle.
They were tired of treaties.
The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge is approximately eight times higher than the U.S. national average.
They're killing themselves while we watch them die."
Is any of this your responsibility today?
The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota.
So, this incident that I'm going to describe really began with some diarrhea.
This solution has been called, by some, "potentially the most important medical advance this century."
But if you look, even today there are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deaths in India alone.
But in this case we cracked it, but a big part of the problem still remains.
Well, look at some old ways, some ways that we'd already cracked.
They do lots of inconsistent things.
Just so you don't embarrass yourselves, I'll give you the right answer: It's increase.
Well, one possibility -- I think that's how most people respond to this -- is to say, "That's just stupid."
This first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge.
Let's think about 10 for a second.
Let's go back to kindergarten. OK?
Now the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud.
I want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety?"
And they say, "You know what? Do I need turbo? Do I need this heavyweight car?"
If we want to encourage change of behavior, gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness.
You can be safe because when you're hit, you survive, or you can be safe because you avoid accidents.
And I think maybe I'm being too negative.
Here is an innovation, a design innovation.
Here's another example of this.
I think this tells us there is an opportunity.
I mean, it sometimes feels, listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of putting into place academically, what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time.
How you take your insights here and actually get them integrated into working business models on the ground, in Indian villages, for example?
If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics, I'm not going to give her a soldering iron.
And this is nothing new.
If I push these together, the light turns off.
I plug in again the power to it.
We have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes.
These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland: "Everybody always thinks they are right."
We steamed up the windows permanently, and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window.
We let that lie around in the sun.
Do you agree?
Forward, don't move the wrist.
So, that was the warming up.
And I think I'll take off this one.
Which number? One, two, three, four or five?
Yeah. Thank you.
So here I have, actually -- I know exactly where the cards are.
OK.
Here I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate.
No, I'm kidding.
You don't see it, make no reaction?
Here -- shortcuts. I talk about shortcuts.
Jack of spades.
It's the last.
Ten of diamonds.
Not the last. Yes, that's difficult to find a card here.
Here, I will do the most difficult thing.
Zoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes.
This -- oh sorry, don't look at the beam. My fault.
Do the cameras see the cards now?
Name -- anyone, name, please, any suit.
I try to do this right here. First, I take the spades.
OK. That should be my end effect, but OK.
Another suit. LG: Diamonds, perfect.
Yes, yes, OK.
Aargh!
Satisfied?
So, what was the card?
Always I've found two, but the wrong color. Spades, sorry.
Okay.
Yeah, I do this. I know where it is, because I peeked before and then I do this.
Jack of diamonds, correct?
King of diamonds. LG: Ah!
Now, there's a similar situation in the classical music world, because there are some people who think that classical music is dying.
Then he practices for another year and takes lessons -- now he's nine.
And the 10-year-old, on every eight notes.
And I moved his body like that, while he was playing.
And you have CDs in your car, and you go to the symphony.
You couldn't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome.
It's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading to realize whatever he's dreaming.
Then your companion will dig you in the ribs and say, "Wake up! It's culture!" And then you feel even worse.
Now, it goes down to A. Now to G. And then to F.
No, otherwise the play would be over, stupid.
Now, he tries E again. That chord doesn't work.
It's the wrong chord. It's the wrong chord. It's the wrong chord.
Would you think of somebody who you adore, who's no longer there?
Now, how would you walk -- because you know, my profession, the music profession doesn't see it that way.
My picture appears on the front of the CD -- -- but the conductor doesn't make a sound.
If the eyes are not shining, you get to ask a question.
So now, I have one last thought, which is that it really makes a difference what we say -- the words that come out of our mouth.
Thank you, thank you.
But today, against my better judgment, against the advice of my own wife, I want to try to dust off some of those legal skills -- what's left of those legal skills.
I bring you into a room. I give you a candle, some thumbtacks and some matches.
Now I want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem, done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg, who is now at Princeton University in the U.S.
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.
That's actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tasks.
If-then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks, where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to.
Software can do it faster.
Now, I mean it makes me crazy.
They gave these MIT students a bunch of games, games that involved creativity, and motor skills, and concentration.
What happens?
Training ground for great economic thinkers like George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek, and Mick Jagger.
And it doesn't mean it's going to work forever.
And they do something incredibly cool.
And it's worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level with 20 Percent Time -- done, famously, at Google -- where engineers can work, spend 20 percent of their time working on anything they want.
Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional.
Different model, right?
Autonomy, mastery and purpose, versus carrot and sticks. And who wins?
So, if we repair this mismatch between what science knows and what business does, if we bring our motivation, notions of motivation into the 21st century, if we get past this lazy, dangerous, ideology of carrots and sticks, we can strengthen our businesses, we can solve a lot of those candle problems, and maybe, maybe, maybe we can change the world.
And the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction.
That's the Sun at that end.
This is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist.
It's susceptible to motion by the air currents.
These were white spheres.
This has a diamond-bottomed lake.
This has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations.
So it can see its environment, and then it can mimic its environment and disappear.
It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system.
Here's a picture of the kids.
And social business needs markets, and there are some issues for which you just can't develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market.
And the answer is, these social problems are massive in scale, our organizations are tiny up against them, and we have a belief system that keeps them tiny.
But you want to make half a million dollars trying to cure kids of malaria, and you're considered a parasite yourself.
So we tell the for-profit sector, "Spend, spend, spend on advertising until the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value."
We got that many people to participate by buying full-page ads in The New York Times, in The Boston Globe, in primetime radio and TV advertising.
Well, you and I know when you prohibit failure, you kill innovation.
Well, you put those five things together -- you can't use money to lure talent away from the for-profit sector, you can't advertise on anywhere near the scale the for-profit sector does for new customers, you can't take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers that the for-profit sector takes, you don't have the same amount of time to find them as the for-profit sector, and you don't have a stock market with which to fund any of this, even if you could do it in the first place, and you've just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantage to the for-profit sector on every level.
There are a lot of problems with this question.
We launched the breast cancer three-days with an initial investment of 350,000 dollars in risk capital.
The overhead went up.
But only about 20 percent of that, or 60 billion dollars, goes to health and human services causes.
Who cares what the overhead is if these problems are actually getting solved?
You know, this little office of the conductor.
Let's look at the first video.
This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in Vienna.
People who build this wonderful concert hall.
So clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.
But -- -- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.
And you know what happened to Muti?
It's not true. When he was a young man of about 30, he wrote what he called "The Ten Commandments for Conductors."
It's only the execution of the written music, no interpretation."
Okay? Ready? Let's do it.
And after doing that, they really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together.
He says, "This is the gesture of the music.
You have the plan in your head.
And look again at this Kleiber.
You know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important.
Look at the eyes.
And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.
Did you see Lenny's face?
And even briefly, you become the storyteller to which the community, the whole community, listens to.
It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.
Already that's fallen to about 11.
So the IPCC said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.
There is the story of "The Elves and the Shoemaker."
And in terms of climate change, is something that is not actually feasible.
But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.
It's sensitive to place and to scale.
And it's really about how systems, settlements, withstand shock from the outside.
And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.
Promoting recycling, things like garden-share, that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.
And that's certainly been my experience with transition.
I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories.
Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices, the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.
Most education funding -- whether it's K through 12, or the great universities or community colleges -- most of the money for those things is coming out of these state budgets.
Answer is 26 percent.
How could you have a problem like this?
They borrow money.
This is the retiree health care benefits.
Within the education community there's this discussion of, "Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off, or the less good teachers who get laid off?"
Well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay.
The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis, both inside Google and Microsoft and outside, with analysts and people of various opinions -- should they have spent on that?
We need lots more.
In fact, there are some like these: Erskine Bowles, Alan Simpson and others, who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem.
And so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids and our future.
It was oxygen. I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv, and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory, but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine. And that afternoon, I had to ask him, "How was it for you making that decision?"
Playing for Nathaniel, the music took on a deeper meaning, because now it was about communication, a communication where words failed, a communication of a message that went deeper than words, that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche, yet came as a true musical offering from me.
Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone.
Now, before we get to that answer, let me tell you about Chris Hosmer.
However, here's Chris' clock.
One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose.
Jinsop Lee: Hey, my name's Jinsop, and today, I'm going to show you what riding motorbikes is like from the point of view of the five senses. Hey!
Okay, next, clubbing.
You see, up till now, us designers, we've mainly focused on making things look very pretty, and a little bit of touch, which means we've ignored the other three senses.
Now, I don't play the flute or the clarinet, so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play: the television remote control.
And the best way to do that is with free candy.
Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?
So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.
They are talking about things they didn't see.
Soon, a story develops.
Kafka did not show his work to his father.
Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend, or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots -- things like that.
Playing doesn't tire us.
Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons, but they aren't fun anymore.
Then my teacher said, "Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling."
Look what I found.
Next, a urinal was placed on its side and called "Fountain".
Our artistic desire doesn't go away.
The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else, but the dad alone builds castles.
Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.
I walk around and encourage them, "Come on, come on!" They have to write like crazy for an hour or two.
And in this moment, the nagging devil disappears.
When we say, "I think I'll try acting. There's a drama school in the community center," or "I'd like to learn Italian songs," they ask, "Oh, yeah? A play? What for?"
So I asked the driver, "What is this?"
The great artist, then in her 90s, arrived at Gimpo Airport and a reporter asked her a typical question: "What do you have to do to become a great dancer?
Thank you.
And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts.
I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement, "To understand and protect the home planet," to justify my talks.
It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses.
That's how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day.
Careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO2 changes by a few centuries.
The physics does not change.
Most estimates are that, this century, we will get at least one meter.
The Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico heatwave and drought last year, Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003, were all exceptional events, more than three standard deviations outside the norm.
This path, if continued, guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations.
So now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm.
What I'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television, and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before.
What safety they had was very scant.
Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date, some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts.
And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air, and hopefully you make it look good.
Being run over is never easy.
I drove the other one at 60 miles an hour, exactly the same speed, and clearly walked away from it.
Even then, I caught seven G and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in.
They used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them.
Completely in the safety of a studio, and yet with the green screen we can have some moving image that a skydiver took, and put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by.
And aerial stunts. No aerial stunt would be the same without skydiving.
It's that shape because the helium has to expand.
I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.
Above 50,000 feet you need a space suit, a pressure suit.
And what must that feel like?
Trying to find a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that I never really expected when I set about doing this.
You know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feet and the cabin depressurizes, you can have oxygen.
I was going to wear it, but I thought I'd get Costa to do it, my lovely assistant.
I've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel, which means that I can practice everything I need to practice, in safety, before I ever jump out of anything. Thanks very much, Costa.
There have been three themes, haven't there, running through the conference, which are relevant to what I want to talk about.
Like religion, and money and other things.
Thank you very much. So, 15 minutes left.
Do you remember the story? No, it was big.
The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out if it.
And stop speaking like that. It's confusing everybody."
Every one. Doesn't matter where you go.
Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads.
They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way.
Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right?
When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job.
If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive.
Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school. And at the end of it -- because she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on, little kid of eight -- in the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said, "Gillian, I've listened to all these things that your mother's told me, and I need to speak to her privately."
She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School; she became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School and founded her own company -- the Gillian Lynne Dance Company -- met Andrew Lloyd Weber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history; she's given pleasure to millions; and she's a multi-millionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down.
By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it. Thank you very much.
Working in London as TV maker and writer, I quickly realized that comedy connects audiences.
Now, the American head of programming wanted new local Arabic comedy.
I excitedly presented this to the big boss, and his reaction was, "Um, I don't get it."
I invited our new CEO, and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels, his reaction was very simple: "Let's make this happen.
Now, were the Axis successful?
So clearly, from the inside, we are doing our best to change our image, and it's exploding.
Here are three questions that I like to use to test the truthiness of our representation in any media story.
As my father likes to call him, "Asheikh Azubare;" as my mother would say, "Shakespeare."
Today, we've seen a 63-percent reduction in mortality from heart disease -- remarkably, 1.1 million deaths averted every year.
What you may not realize is just how prevalent it is.
I mean, cancer seems far more serious.
Fifty percent will have onset by age 14, 75 percent by age 24, a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease, diabetes, hypertension -- most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality.
What I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders, diseases of the mind.
These are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia, and you can see already in the top there's areas that are red or orange, yellow, are places where there's less gray matter, and as they followed them over five years, comparing them to age match controls, you can see that, particularly in areas like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus, there's a profound loss of gray matter.
The good-news stories in medicine are early detection, early intervention.
"We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10." -- Bill Gates.
We walked through these slums, identified houses where children would never go to school.
How are you going to replicate?"
So, June it rains, so many a times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof, waiting for the rain to stop.
No one in their generation has spoken English.
And this little boy has been coming to school for five years.
We had 25 mothers who came regularly after school to study.
We've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school.
I had very good friends there, who are from Delhi, who are from Mumbai.
SB: This girl was working as a maid before she came to school.
Is it the exposure? We have professors from MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Indian Institute of Science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas, experiments, much beyond the classroom.
But we began with the idea of one child at a time.
Now, "horsing" is going for a horse ride.
I think I was supposed to talk about my new book, which is called "Blink," and it's about snap judgments and first impressions.
In fact, the data doesn't make any sense.
Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?
And they would say, you know, "Move! Next!"
Now in the industry -- I don't know whether you care about this, or how much time I have to go into this.
And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen, and he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce. And he varied them according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce: by sweetness, by level of garlic, by tartness, by sourness, by tomatoey-ness, by visible solids -- my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business.
Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing.
And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar, and 14 different kinds of mustard, and 71 different kinds of olive oil -- and then eventually even Ragu hired Howard, and Howard did the exact same thing for Ragu that he did for Prego.
Even though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did.
Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon. Right?
A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning.
What do I mean by that?
And where did that come from? It came from Italy.
And it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals, because all of science, through the 19th century and much of the 20th, was obsessed with universals.
I'll give you one last illustration of variability, and that is -- oh, I'm sorry.
Billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer; all the scouts told him so.
There's subclinical atherosclerosis, subclinical hardening of the arteries, obviously linked to heart attacks, potentially.
Strike three is menopause.
If I used someone else's pre-death, I apologize, I think I made it up.
They want a treatment. They want to be told, this is what you have and this is how you treat it. If the doctor doesn't give you that, you go somewhere else.
I went to medical school, and I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically, or How Not to Order Tests.
But, you know, there are ways out.
Of the five senses, vision is the one that I appreciate the most, and it's the one that I can least take for granted.
Decades later, it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection.
So, here's my dad: he's a scientist, he's an engineer and he's a military contractor.
Or even the people who actually pulled it off, the people at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston, who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network, and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's -- on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts, just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred and listening to Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips singing "Midnight Train to Georgia," while -- -- in my dad's big easy chair, you know?
In comics, I know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works.
So -- so this was my nature. The thing was, I saw that the route that I took to discovering this focus in my work and who I was, I saw it as just this road to discovery.
Also, to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals.
And within 100 years, you already start to see word balloons and captions, and it's really just a hop, skip and a jump from here to here.
There were hypertext comics.
Now, the monitor is just as limited as the page, technically, right?
This was an early collage comic by a fellow named Jason Lex.
That's why most people turn to storytelling, is to escape.
Which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel when I realized that I was being swept along on this remarkable, vivid journey in translation.
Ever since I can remember thinking consciously about such things, communication has been my central passion.
Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language.
And also because that's where, in terms of our own self-interest, we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond, our responsibility to the rest of the world.
The description perfectly captured Edwards' personal vanity.
A great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick, where you think it's going over here and then all of a sudden you're transported over here.
Have at it you radical bastards. The field is yours.
And my guess here -- and I have no research on this -- is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it, you'd find out that comedy is the second oldest viral profession.
Now Governor Perry of my newly-adopted state of Texas was pushing this same line this past summer at the beginning of his oops-fated campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete at the same time that 250 out of 254 counties in the state of Texas were on fire.
Shortly after the conference was over, Joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the EPA in Washington whose wall it now hangs on.
Now, I've got a story for you.
And I play when I design.
Be serious, it says.
Washington, D.C. is solemn.
It can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance, or out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness.
And what -- the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was, what was going on around me and the things that came at the time I walked into design were the enemy.
You had to go places and find the stuff.
I mean, these covers appeared all over the world, and they started winning awards, and people knew them.
And in the depth of despair, in the midst of the movie, when it looks like he can't pull this thing off, and he needs this case, he needs to win this case so badly.
And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this.
It enabled me to really express myself and grow.
Then "Chicago" came out, used similar graphics, and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away, which meant I had to change it.
I said, "Why can't the signage be on the floor?"
I hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building, and they loved it.
I was invited to design a logo for this neighborhood, called the North Side, and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo.
And I actually am amused by them and like them, and think that as a very, very, very, very, very big corporation they actually keep their graphics very nice.
They would take me about six months initially, but then I started getting faster at it.
And they sold quickly, and became rather popular.
And that's a terrifying factor -- when you start something and it turns that way -- because it means that all that's left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can push, that you can invent, that you can be ignorant about, that you can be arrogant about, that you can fail with, and that you can be a fool with.
And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians, who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow, and I would love to see where that leads.
Well, Philip Anderson may have been right.
They like to sunbathe, can't blame them.
They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared, 65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs, and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction -- oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.
They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.
If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination, then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators -- how they live their lives, like the Mola.
And it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.
They don't seem to mind, so far.
And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior, it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.
You truly can swim up to a Mola -- they're very gentle -- and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.
So that's a very important piece of data.
We see the same pattern -- now with these tags we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas, a real three-dimensional play.
I was getting reports from Catholic nuns, Jewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians -- everybody writing in, united by their love of life.
LEDs are smaller, they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient.
It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes.
So, take a look.

How does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it?
Then Indra disappeared.
May he be called to wash away his sins."
If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail.
And that is the astonishing power of art.
When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer, came upon a phenomenon that worried her.
And I thought, "This is what we need, as a language."
Well, somebody had a great idea.
[Video] Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.
So this is the cotton sari.
So much peace in one place?
And as for outsiders, white, black or brown, tar and feather them, and whip them out of town.
Hello, gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood.
And there are stand-up comics who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues.
There are more people dying of simple things.
But the king had an idea.
But the princess said, "Father, Mother, don't worry.
It's the universe in which these machines are now doing all these things, including changing biology.
Here, we have all the binary arithmetic and logic that drove the computer revolution.
And that's really the simplest computer.
The guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle, Vladimir Zworykin, from RCA.
And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern, who wrote the "Theory of Games."
These were not theoretical physicists.
So, there's 40 of these tubes, like a V-40 engine running the memory.
And that's what I've been doing, this last six months, is going through the logs.
"Everything up to this point is wasted time." "What's the use? Good night."
"Picked a lightning bug off the drum." "Running at two kilocycles."
"Only happens when the machine is running."
He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now.
When the bomb people went home, he was allowed in there.
You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype.
And there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago.
And the question is, should we run them or not?
Sadly, in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat, four Americans that are alive will be dead from the food that they eat.
Please put your hands up.
Look at homicide at the bottom, for God's sake.
We need a revolution.
I've been doing this for seven years.
I want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about: your public, your children.
The family's obese.
He has to bury the people, OK?
Now it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives, extra ingredients, and you know the rest of the story.
That ain't happening anymore.
But I'm killing them.
School food is something that most kids -- 31 million a day, actually -- have twice a day, more than often, breakfast and lunch, 180 days of the year.
There's a problem: If you're not a food expert, and you've got tight budgets and it's getting tighter, then you can't be creative, you can't duck and dive and write different things around things.
We're not teaching our kids.
JO: No. What do you think this is? Onion. JO: Onion? No.
Every kid has the right to milk at school.
Now, I don't know about you guys, but judging the circumstances, right, any judge in the whole world, would look at the statistics and the evidence, and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse. That's my belief.
Where else do you shop so religiously?
It's the future. It's the only way.
There needs to be a new standard of fresh, proper food for your children. Yeah?
Let's go back to the home.
Huntington's Kitchen. I work with a community.
The problem is they all want to roll out what they're doing to the next school, and the next, but there's no cash.
So, my wish.
being a victim of hacking for a change.
And their politics are not entirely unattractive.
These were the various things that I was looking at as I was trying to understand it.
And so nothing is going into the hackers.
But what about the real cybercriminals?
And that challenge is: How do you do business, how do you trust somebody on the Web who you want to do business with when you know that they're a criminal?
We had a champagne decade for people who we know as Carders.
And often they're the most vulnerable element of all.
Born in Meridian, Idaho.
And then finally, Cagatay Evyapan, aka Cha0 -- one of the most remarkable hackers ever, from Ankara in Turkey.
Now I discussed this with Professor Simon Baron-Cohen who's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge.
So your idea worth spreading is hire hackers.
So whether it's redeveloping dying malls or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots, I think the fact is the growing number of empty and under-performing, especially retail, sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least-sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places.
We're just driving so much more; we haven't been able to keep up technologically.
I mean, that's 2005 figures.
We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.
It's keeping the lights on.
It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.
And then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact, mixed-use New England village, and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side.
Transit is a big driver of retrofits.
So here's the site in 1975 with the mall.
It's about two-thirds built out right now.
They took the commercial strip shown on the black-and-white images below, and they built a boulevard that has become the Main Street for their town.
When the shopping center died, the city restored the site's original wetlands, creating lakefront property, which then attracted private investment, the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood in over 40 years.
It's a little extreme, but we've got a little water problem.
And they are public places, but that are managed by private companies.
Thank you.
I interviewed a high-powered businesswoman; she told me she didn't have time.
Women love to talk about their vaginas -- they do.
A woman told me there, her mother used to tell her, "Don't wear panties, dear, underneath your pajamas.
And so I said to a friend casually, "Well, what do you think about your vagina?"
One is seeing what's right in front of you, and talking about it, and stating it. I think what I learned from talking about the vagina, and speaking about the vagina, is it was the most obvious thing -- it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world -- and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about.
And in one year, it went to 50 colleges, and then it expanded.
I have seen terrible, terrible, terrible violence.
I have met these women everywhere on the planet.
And at that time we did this extraordinary V-Day at Madison Square Garden where we sold out the entire testosterone-filled dome, 18,000 people standing up to say "yes" to vaginas, which was really a pretty incredible transformation.
300 women have disappeared in a border town because they're brown and poor.
And she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep, I could get around a lot faster."
And I want to tell you a great story. When Agnes first started fighting to stop female genital mutilation in her community, she had become an outcast, and she was exiled and she was slandered, and the whole community turned against her.
And I feel that knowledge and that journey has been an extraordinary privilege, and I feel really blessed to have been here today to communicate that to you.
He was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead and whose grandchildren lived far away.
The night watchman, seeing how things were going and waxing indignant, said, "Well, we're going to call the police, aren't we?"
And the Gauleiter, who afterwards vanishes from this story, leaned down and whispered into Mr. Teszler's ear, "No, do not take the capsule. Help is on the way."
"Good. Buy us some land in Kings Mountain and announce we are going to build a major plant there."
He had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of Kings Mountain, and for two months these 16 men would live and work together, mastering the new process.
It was an achievement worthy of Mahatma Gandhi, conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint.
And it was at his house that I heard for the first time Bartok's Third Piano Concerto and learned from Mr. Teszler that it had been composed in nearby Asheville, North Carolina in the last year of the composer's life.
And now he's dead, so I'm stuck with my vow.
Mr. Milliken said it was not. Dr. Robicsek disagreed.
This defines the imagined futures of our fellow Hungarians -- Robicsek, Teszler and Bartok -- as it does my own.
I thought maybe I'd pronounced it wrong.
What is it? How is it made? Why was it made?
Well, I became a tapestry historian.
But in reality, in the course of the coming weeks and months, hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show.
We live in an age of ubiquitous information, and sort of "just add water" expertise, but there's nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well-told narrative, what the curator does, the interpretation of a complex, esoteric subject, in a way that retains the integrity of the subject, that makes it -- unpacks it for a general audience.
By the end of the show, we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show, but no one really complained.
They feel that the institution is elitist.
So there was no job, no food.
Every morning we have about 400 patients, maybe more or less.
We are sharing with them whatever we have.
They were the leaders, and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations.
So empowering the women and giving the opportunity -- we are there for them. They are not alone for this.
Then my father allowed me to proceed [with] my hope.
So some of our character, maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training.
She's very tough; it's most challenging.
Thank you.
If you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens, that one-year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for 1,600 years.
And most of all, it was not even in my college textbooks.
This is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water.
You know, we're going to do this, we're going to take it away from something else.
But in the early days, the only way I could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine, a very small submarine, and go down to the bottom.
So we went to the moon, played golf up there, before we went to the largest feature on our own planet.
In plate tectonic theory, we knew that if you had plates collide, it made sense: they would crush into one another, you would thicken the crust, you'd uplift it.
We mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat.
So the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor, and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range.
We were not predicting it.
But more importantly, they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand.
Again, discovered by accident. Just two years ago working off Santorini, where people are sunning themselves on the beach, unbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby, we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and more life systems.
It contains more history than all of the museums on land combined.
This one sank carrying a prefabricated, Home Depot Roman temple.
We own all of that blue and yet, like I say, particularly the western territorial trust, we don't have maps of them. We don't have maps of them.
We'll go into areas we have no knowledge of.
You don't have enough gaming experience.
This is a young lady, not watching a football game, not watching a basketball game.
I was born to a family where education was pervasive.
When the gates opened, there was a stampede, and 20 people were injured and one woman died.
He said the big breakthroughs are what happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.
So, having seen the impact of this, Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up, to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.
Or Jenny, who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master's degree.
These are the spikes showing that procrastination is global phenomenon.
Other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.
So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.
Now, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students if you do not have 10,000 TAs?
Now, of course we cannot yet grade the range of work that one needs for all courses.
So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised, where tens of thousands of students are grading each other's work, and quite successfully, I have to say.
Students also self-assembled, without any kind of intervention from us, into small study groups.
Personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well, because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30-year-old problem.
Hence, the 2 sigma problem.
He said that, "College is a place where a professor's lecture notes go straight to the students' lecture notes, without passing through the brains of either."
So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free, what would that do? Three things.
And I thought that if time could reach forwards and backwards infinitely, doesn't that mean that every point in time is really infinitely small, and therefore somewhat meaningless.
"You must get them custom made -- special, humongous guitars."
I started with improvisation, in a particular form of improvisation called theater games, which had one rule, which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society.
Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer, in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron.
When we say "I," -- as when Rene Descartes said, "I think therefore I am," -- we mean the head.
It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure -- but nevertheless, what makes us treasure you and adore you.
Not a caress, but a wave of pain.
You make yourself the active voice.
And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had -- That's the first callback, of my attempted quadruple.
And I really learned this lesson during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or, Or as I call them, the good ol' days.
So that Roman society was very top/bottom, as ours is to some degree.
I know that word is so debased now by the use of it by Internet marketers.
And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know?
Well, look at Michael Hawley, or look at Dean Kamen, or look at my grandmother.
Where you deny the other person's reality, you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist, I think there's another philosophical construction.
The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared.
I guess the more you matter the more space you take up, which explains the whole SUV phenomenon.
And I suspect, by someone who actively dislikes us.
And the daughter doesn't want to say anything.
And you know the biggest hurdle for me, in doing what I do, is constructing my performance so that it's prepared and unprepared.
And they would inevitably end up in what I thought was a very bizarre place, which is ways the world could end very suddenly.
President George W. Bush: Whatever it costs to defend our security, and whatever it costs to defend our freedom, we must pay it.
People around the world are getting better medicine -- but mentally, we're falling apart.
But it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills.
It's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe, and probably fairly close to us, is a fairly remote idea.
Thank God you can all read!
It wasn't really a research report; it was a screed.
There is some modeling of ecosystems going on now.
They expect them to evaporate.
We have an electromagnetic field around the Earth, and it's constantly bombarded by high-energy particles, like protons.
This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently, that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world, from biotechnology, that literally could destroy the world's food supply in very short order.
It's been 780,000 years since this happened.
If you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth, it would be the thickness of two pennies, at 14 pounds per square inch.
There's a flip side to it. In studying stars like our Sun, we've found that they go through periods of diminishment, when their total amount of energy that's expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent.
There's no reason why we shouldn't start now.
A staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it when antibiotics come, and change and mutate.
But galaxies are very violent places, and things can be spun out of orbit.
Again, we gotta think about being a colonizing race.
An asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions.
You'll notice that the chance of an asteroid-slash-comet impact killing you is about one in 20,000, according to the work they've done.
Comets are a tougher act.
When the mission was over, they actually landed on the thing.
We know about this stuff.
And he scans across the ocean, and he looks at the sky.
It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific.
Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here, but what I want you to see is this is about 10 percent of the processes that operate within the oceans almost continuously, and have for the last 4 billion years.
Look at this complexity here.
All right, let's talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans.
Seconds after this video was taken, people in Beijing, people in Sydney, people in Amsterdam, people in Washington D.C. were watching this.
Some of you remember this, I'm sure.
But without data, those models will never ever be predicted.
And let me show you what's behind it.
And this is just the first of these.
This is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location, then move to a new location.
And these are the things that we're funded to do today.
Imaging: Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I, but stereo imaging at four times the definition that we have in HD will be routine within five years.
It's far beyond what we currently have.
They sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor during an eruption, which have the microbes that have never been to the surface of the planet before.
Many of you don't think of this yet, but the ocean will be in your pocket.
And I think, when I listen to these incredible people here, I've been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas, so many visions.
It's not, perhaps, the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners.
They were built in times that were not really the best of times in a certain way.
And, of course, expressive spaces are not mute.
It's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending.
Life without emotion would really not be life.
But architecture is not the language of words.
Because I believe that the hand in all its primitive, in all its physiological obscurity, has a source, though the source is unknown, though we don't have to be mystical about it.
And as wondrous as it is, it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification that we have often come to be admired.
It's not something that comes to us from books and theories.
And of course habits are enforced by architecture.
And so I do like something which is pointed, not blunt, something which is focused on reality, something that has the power, through its leverage, to transform even a very small space.
So I've been never interested in the forgettable reuse, rehashing of the same things over and over again, which, of course, get accolades of critics.
It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available.
It should not play it safe, because if it plays it safe it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be.
It's about creating with minimal means something which can not be repeated, cannot be simulated in any other sphere.
Where people cannot speak, cannot vote, cannot do anything.
This is America. This is liberty.
Not just for New York, but for the world.
It's called Kunene region.
We live a very traditional lifestyle.
But then, he said, "If you see a leopard, boy, you better run like hell."
Between 1966 and 1990, the U.S. and Soviet interests fought for control over my country.
I remember a night when a hungry leopard went into the house of one of our neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed.
Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening: wildlife disappearing, poaching was skyrocketing, and the situation seemed very hopeless.
We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands; we needed to learn more things like GPS just to see whether -- can GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West?
And that was a very strong thing in Namibia.
Thirty years have passed since my father's first job as a community game guard.
They stay very much far away because this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals.
Very important as well -- we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education.
Sustainability represents the what, the where and the how of what is caught.
I think we call it restorative seafood.
You've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here -- comes from sustainable stocks.
Vegetables: they might yet save the oceans.
Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat.
Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.
That's a reward I am not willing to pass up.
They got healthier. I made more money.
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you.
I expect that producing ingredients, preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests.
But of all the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans, I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right.
Science tends to look at the world through the rational, the quantitative -- things that can be measured and described -- but it gives art a terrific context of understanding.
Whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of is it raining more or is it raining less?
It's been observed, it's measured, it's bomb-proof information.
Well, within about three weeks, I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras into 25 time-lapse cameras.
Here's a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made.
We've been out for two and a half years, and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go.
Key issues: this is a 400,000 year record.
We are way, way outside the normal, natural variability.
This is an aerial picture we did this year.
A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it's retreated and deflated, gone back up valley.
And everybody says, well don't they advance in the winter time?
So that's where we started three years ago, way out on the left, and that's where we were a few months ago, the last time we went into Columbia.
You can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this, but the camera records it.
All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick, just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle.
We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago, as you can see. June 25th, monster calving events happened.
Okay, how big was that? It's hard to get it.
When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China, it has, you know, led to considerable angst amongst the Western populations.
They laughed. They dismissed us.
It turned out, in every single case, they came out of the Indian educational system.
And specifically, there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of India.
Interestingly, what he finds is — and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations: How many times does a future patent reference the older patent? — he finds something very interesting.
It's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product, but not a new product itself?
Without that, you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today.
So, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs, at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.
Rachelle Garniez: Quand il me prend dans ses bras Il me parle tout bas, Je vois la vie en rose. Il me dit des mots d'amour, Des mots de tous les jours, Et ca me fait quelque chose. Il est entre dans mon coeur Une part de bonheur Dont je connais la cause. C'est lui pour moi. Moi pour lui Dans la vie, Il me l'a dit, l'a jure [pour] la vie. Et des que je l'apercois Alors je sens en moi Mon coeur qui bat
And my last assignment there was to run a unit called intervention development, which was responsible for designing interventions.
In fact, I wasn't aware of any problems in America.
And there were two essential explanations or ideas that were prevalent.
And so the sense that I had was there was a giant gap here.
There was clustering.
In order to interrupt transmission, you need to detect and find first cases.
And then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the United States at the time.
What do you mean, epidemic?
Many of the major cities in the U.S., including New York City and Baltimore and Kansas City, their health departments are running this now.
It gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility of replacing some of these prisons with playgrounds or parks, and to consider the possibility of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods, and to allow there to be a new strategy, a new set of methods, a new set of workers: science, in a way, replacing morality.
Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment, births, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies.
A time for even grimmer stuff than that, like in last April's New Yorker magazine.
Not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning I can find.
But he didn't die on Dench's birthday.
In fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see.
Sure you were, because you've prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you.
I mean after all, this whole business happened on his watch.
Tumor Treating Fields were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti, professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel.
Gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses.
We can think of a cell from an electrical perspective as if it's a mini space station.
What we see is that the cells will attempt to divide for several hours.
The cells round up for division, but they're very static in that position.
In that time, Novocure's developed two systems -- one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body.
And five years ago, Robert was diagnosed with GBM.
He entered our trial.
And the therapy is delivered continuously at home, without having to go into the hospital either periodically or continually.
I am the happiest, the happiest person in the world.
Three years ago, she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial.
There's research underway now at Harvard Medical School to pick the optimum pairs to maximize that benefit.
It receives the least rainfall in the country, lowest rainfall.
This is a new work, it's a new program.
But here it is unwritten by law.
You can calculate the price of that water.
It can envy many municipalities, the color, the taste, the purity of this water.
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.
This town was established 800 years ago.
Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms.
This was for mass communication.
But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009, there will be a TED green and blue session, so they painted it like this.
So, these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area.
Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side there is a four-story building where you can organize such TED conferences anytime.
So, you can find through your Jeep, a camel, and a cart.
These are the trees.
And these [unclear], which stored water, there are two type of things.
That means if an African child is born today, rather than three days ago, they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan.
Among the reasons I think it's happening right now is the quality of the leadership across Africa.
That's an awful lot of debt.
Now, that's completely changed now.
Would you set up a factory in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s?
But when I'm thinking about the future, I'm actually most interested in Central, Western and Southern Africa.
In Ghana in the elections, in December 2012, the battle between the two candidates was over education.
When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority.
But what I'm saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing.
Very good. I think you're secretly saying to your head, probably five and a half percent.
And then something happened in 1980.
No, not right now, just 30 seconds.
Well, I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus, which, as some of you may know, is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy.
However, there is an underlying argument about logistics, which has driven so much of this debate. Right?
For those of you who think that new media of the Internet could somehow help us avert genocide, should look no further than Rwanda, where in the '90s it was actually two radio stations which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place.
So the only way to control this message is actually to try to spin it and accuse anyone who has written something critical of being, for example, a CIA agent.
Instead of trying to purge these comments, they instead went and reached out to the bloggers.
And first it's quite simple.
So inviting people to all sorts of public forums, having them participate in decision making, it's actually great.
If you look at some of the surveys on how the young people actually benefit from the Internet, you'll see that the number of teenagers in China, for example, for whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life, is three times more than in the United States.
I grew up in New York City, between Harlem and the Bronx.
And when they were about five and six, four and five, Jay could come to me, come to me crying.
Just go on, go on in your room.
We lived in New York City, as I said.
Now I expected him to say something like, I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good.
He was having sex.
Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.
Because, while Sheila never said no, she also never said yes.
Now I say this all with remorse, and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time, but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited, because I didn't get caught.
The center for disease control says that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions, is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad.
And I just don't think that's what India's all about, or should be all about.
And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year, we grew at 6.7 percent.
And in the information era we all live in today, what we might call the TED age, I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incessant diet of Internet news, of televised images, of cellphone videos, of email gossip.
Currently there are 509 million cellphones in Indian hands, in India.
You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi, on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the 16th century, wielding a coal-fired steam iron that might have been invented in the 18th century.
Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open, if the market was on, whether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.
I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother in a village in Senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar, just to watch a Bollywood movie.
Why? Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera, "Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.
But, today in Britain, for example, Indian restaurants in Britain employ more people than the coal mining, ship building and iron and steel industries combined.
But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.
But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.
It was essentially India being itself.
We can't really be both of those.
So as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says, "Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?"
So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready.
You just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out.
I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet.
I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.
And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.
And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them.
I'm talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma.
So then there's also my favorite example of suspended animation.
She was extremely cold, and she had no heartbeat -- for all intents and purposes she was dead, frozen.
Doctors have a saying that, in fact, "You're not dead until you're warm and dead."
And this precise oxygen concentration, 10 parts per million, that caused suspended animation, is conserved.
And there's the very important thing there: If you want to survive the cold, you ought to be suspended. Right?
And so, we went looking for such things.
Now, hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us.
It stopped moving.
So we started to think: Is this the agent that might have been present in the skier, and might have she had more of it than someone else, and might that have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died, as we found out with our worm experiments?
So these proof of concept experiments led me to say "I should found a company, and we should take this out to a wider playing field."
Now, and so -- Thank you. The Phase 1 safety studies are over, and we're doing fine, we're now moved on.
And I want to say that I think we're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way, and that in the not too distant future, an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide, or some related compound, to a person suffering severe injuries, and that person might de-animate a bit, they might become a little more immortal.
This proposition will be found on careful examination to express, in condensed form, the essential purport of the Theory, and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin's meaning; who, by a strange inversion of reasoning, seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill."
It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet.
So if you think first there was sweetness, and then we evolved to like sweetness, you've got it backwards; that's just wrong. It's the other way round.
It's important that we love babies, and that we not be put off by, say, messy diapers.
Now, I think we've found the answer -- I and a few of my colleagues.
It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions we face that have to do with global pandemics, a cross-border problem; with HIV, a transnational problem; with markets and immigration, something that goes beyond national borders; with terrorism, with war, all now cross-border problems.
Those are the public spaces where we announce ourselves as citizens, as participants, as people with the right to write our own narratives.
Not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live.
There are scores of international, inter-city, cross-border institutions, networks of cities in which cities are already, quite quietly, below the horizon, working together to deal with climate change, to deal with security, to deal with immigration, to deal with all of those tough, interdependent problems that we face.
Mayors are pragmatists, they're problem-solvers.
That's what mayors do.
You can run for the Senate out of a different state, but it's hard to do that as a mayor.
When cities interact, they interact like this.
And they are doing it.
Now it's in hundreds of cities around the world.
I believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis.
Thank you.
And I want you to pick somebody that's seated next to you, and when I say, go, you've got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor, OK?
McKim found this every time he did it with his students.
Don't know the reason for the pink flamingos, but anyway, they're there in the garden.
So if somebody can reach under the chair that's next to them, you'll find something taped underneath it.
I want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage.
All right. This is pretty good; this is pretty good.
But why is it important?
We need to figure that out pretty fast.
And this openness is the beginning of exploratory play.
Turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on back over, and you'll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper.
We self-edit as we're having ideas.
He gave each of them some mescaline, and had them listen to some nice, relaxing music for a while.
We don't know, but it may be.
Now, of course, many designers, many individual designers, achieve this is in a much more organic way.
And they were doing that through building prototypes.
Now, that became the first commercial computer mouse for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh.
The prototyping carts, filled with colored paper and Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff -- I mean, they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them.
And just having this very simple prototype allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way.
We've gone through lots of experiences in life, and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work.
Because when we looked at the video when he got back, we saw 20 minutes of this.
And so the idea of role-play is both as an empathy tool, as well as a tool for prototyping experiences.
And it's this code negotiation that leads to productive play.
As designers, we need to be able to transition in and out of play also.
But that's not really true: you can be a serious professional adult and, at times, be playful.
And it doesn't take long to go downhill.
But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic.
Because they could see I was no longer serving them, I was only serving myself.
It took seven years.
Thank you very much.
And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas when I was 18, I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star 101, or even a degree program for that interest.
They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat, and boom, they launched into the Kyrie from the "Requiem" by Mozart.
Well a couple of years ago, a friend of mine emailed me a link, a YouTube link, and said, "You have got to see this."
And I had this idea: if I could get 50 people to all do this same thing, sing their parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube, we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir.
This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore.
Thank you. Thank you.
And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0 that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing, "Sleep," which is another work that I wrote in the year 2000 -- poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri.
So I told the singers, "That's our goal.
I love the idea that she's singing with her sister.
The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other.
You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos, the render time is just atrocious.
I'm not able to tell you what is moral or immoral because we're living in a pluralist society.
There are a couple of these kinds of eco-dashboards right now -- so dashboards built into cars which try to motivate you to drive more fuel efficiently.
But the problem is, as Foucault points out, that every technology of the self has a technology of domination as its flip side.
Or to give you another example, what about a piece of persuasive technology that convinces Muslim women to wear their headscarves?
But in fact, that question "Is it still ethical?"
They have a moral component just in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life that they present to us.
It puts a certain vision of the good life out there in front of us.
A good life -- a life that you say you as a designer consent to by saying, "In the good life, goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably as this chair.
I think that all of these things are eventually informed by the core of all of this -- and this is nothing but life itself.
Everyone is both a learner and a teacher.
Here, I'm explaining how a computer uses the grammar of English to parse sentences, and here, there's a pause and the student has to reflect, understand what's going on and check the right boxes before they can continue.
Or, I should say, the students succeeded.
Students watched the videos on their own, and then they come together to discuss them.
Well, we tried some old ideas and some new and put them together, but there are more ideas to try.
And that's not a joke, we really do.
And he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead.
And so the first question that came to mind was, well, how fast does this limb move?
So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light.
So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.
It's a very beautiful structure.
So, we've had very solid evidence showing that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends, and does, in fact, function as a spring.
And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's -- he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points.
And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell.
But that was not the end of the story.
There's that raptorial appendage -- there's the heel, and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell.
People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it, just like these pictures show.
And I think one explanation for this could be going back to the molting phenomenon.
And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time, and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much.
And the next lines are, "Through the unknown remembered gate, where the last of earth discovered is that which is the beginning."
Now, you're not as thick as two short planks, but you sound like it when you say "Earth," because that demonstration, if I turned around this way -- that earth plane would be as thin as paper.
I'm not talking about James Cameron -- although I could, but I won't.
It actually is a very good working sub -- that's what it was designed for.
And that life enjoys a three-dimensional existence, which is alien to us.
What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals, and move in this three-dimensional space.
And then by moving through the water it's able to take that control.
I don't really look that ugly, but the camera is so close that it's just distorted.
It was the fact she was going so slow.
And then I'd put my sunglasses on, the beard that would all sprout out, and I would say, "I don't need no stinking license."
So anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us, go for it.
So when I also think about design, I think about trying to rework and re-engage the lines on this graph in a more productive way.
So the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called "oyster-tecture."
So we really had a lot to deal with.
And they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem.
What is fuzzy rope, you ask?
So you can imagine scuba diving here.
New word.
If you haven't ordered yet, I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with diseases of the small intestine.
And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away, and of course it never really would go away.
And so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know, founding public-health interventions in the system of the city, one of which was called the "Nuisances Act," which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river.
And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored.
And so he created this map, which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address.
It's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic, which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems if we listen to reason, if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps, if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead, if we listen to the locals who understand what's going on in these kinds of situations.
So an entire philosophy, a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries, goes away.
And she crossed in March, and there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March.
And I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns, many of which I had just interviewed, and heard their stories, and I watched their faces, and they gave us a little FM radio, and we could listen to the translation of his teachings.
And this is -- well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago -- that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left.
As a teenager, he faced the invasion of his country, and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country.
And Moi is 35 years old.
Because at first I wanted -- you know, I've taken him on a couple of trips, but I wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less.
And the shaman -- I did a whole series on shamanism, which is an interesting phenomenon.
He lives in this log cabin -- no running water, no heat other than -- no windows and high-speed Internet connection.
This is all their movies. We've got about 60 movies that these kids have made, and they're quite incredible.
70 percent of the kids couldn't find Afghanistan or Iraq on a map; 60 percent couldn't find India; 30 percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean.
And so, I have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what I call the cosmic scene investigation, that is, looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning, and then following it up and trying to understand it.
And everything but -- four of these light objects are stars, and you can see them there -- little pluses.
And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy.
With the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at hundreds of millions of years to a billion years.
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside, and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang, which is actually incredibly uniform.
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture, and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.
It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on.
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?
And when you're in the middle of the galaxies it's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life.
How are you going to end up doing that?
We're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is.
And so I forgot to tell you the scale.
It's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter, it's got photons and it's got neutrinos, which don't play much role in the later part of the universe.
And so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right?
And if you could see invisible matter, too.
And you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure forming.
And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now, in terms of its expansion.
We see the same large-scale structure, but we see additional small-scale structure.
Thank you.
So I was about 11 when I went along to my first meditation class.
Others will turn to their friends, their family, looking for support.
I think the present moment is so underrated.
It's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment.
So we're looking for a balance, a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement.
But what do you do every 20, 30 seconds?
That's the potential of meditation, of mindfulness.
And this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues, I had trouble holding anything.
The same thing the next day, and then the next, quickly slipping into a creative slump.
Surprisingly, they just handed them right over, and then with some pencils I already had, I made this project for only 80 cents.
Or what if instead of making art to display, I had to destroy it?
In the course of this Goodbye Art series, I created 23 different pieces with nothing left to physically display.
Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about art and having art skills.
Three years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.
It turns out an unlikely community of some 200 people are living inside the zone.
The thing is, they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently.
"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?"
I have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil.
The power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative.
Getting that text was like getting a hug.
I was excited.
And what I've found is that our little devices, those little devices in our pockets, are so psychologically powerful that they don't only change what we do, they change who we are.
I study this.
But you can end up hiding from each other, even as we're all constantly connected to each other.
We short-change ourselves.
And what I'm seeing is that people get so used to being short-changed out of real conversation, so used to getting by with less, that they've become almost willing to dispense with people altogether.
It seemed to be looking in her eyes.
It doesn't know life."
But we're not so comfortable.
It expresses, but it doesn't solve, an underlying problem.
But in the process, we set ourselves up to be isolated.
And if we don't teach our children to be alone, they're only going to know how to be lonely.
Technology is making a bid to redefine human connection -- how we care for each other, how we care for ourselves -- but it's also giving us the opportunity to affirm our values and our direction.
We're drawn to virtual romance, to computer games that seem like worlds, to the idea that robots, robots, will someday be our true companions.
Not everybody could earn an A or a B, and I didn't like that way of judging it.
And I recalled -- I was raised on a small farm in Southern Indiana and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to be better than someone else.
And I think that character is much more important than what you are perceived to be.
Maybe it's because Dad used to read to us at night.
But yet again I may. And later I may say, I knew him once, and he was weak, or strong, or bold or proud or gay.
One was -- never be late. Never be late.
If I see it in a game, you're going to come out and sit on the bench.
But that helped me, I think, become a better teacher.
I believe that we must believe, truly believe. Not just give it word service; believe that things will work out as they should, providing we do what we should.
"Sometimes I think the Fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can't win, is the Fates themselves that miss.
Don't whine. Don't complain. Don't make excuses.
Not necessary to what you would want them to be, but they will be about what they should, and only you will know whether you can do that.
I can never answer that, as far as the individuals are concerned.
I wanted them to be good inside too.
Have I rambled enough?
You can use, actually, scaffolds, biomaterials -- they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt -- but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate.
But I want you to note his co-author: Charles Lindbergh.
Plus we have stem cells.
And that's exactly what we did here.
So that's actually now in patients.
We then grow the cells outside the body, take the scaffold, coat the scaffold with the cells -- the patient's own cells, two different cell types.
Two weeks later, you have something that looks like a liver.
Here's the scanner going through, scanning the wound.
So this is more challenging -- large organ, vascular, a lot of blood vessel supply, a lot of cells present.
And Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now, and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we printed a little bit earlier today.
This is actually the printer that you see here onstage.
So after the surgery, life got a lot better for me.
LM: Ten years ago, when I had my surgery -- and it's really great to see him.
And when I was 10, I didn't realize how amazing it was.
JE: Thank you, Tony.
So in other words, what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem, a problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants," in approximately 60 seconds.
So what's actually happening is that social networks and real-time technologies are taking us back.
Now, you know when you learn a new word, and then you start to see that word everywhere?
It's second nature to them.
One, a renewed belief in the importance of community, and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.
Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree, are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere, or someone, where it is.
Now, the third system is product-service systems.
So I want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors.
In other words, I don't want stuff; I want the needs or experiences it fulfills.
Let's go back to my first example, Swaptree.
Because I really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business, help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption and teach us when enough really is enough.
Every time school closed -- it was a boarding school and I was seven -- you had to travel until you find them.
And there was this specific tribe that was really afraid of this other Luhya tribe.
The man with no legs says, "I can see as far as the end of the world, but I can't save myself from a cat, or whatever animals."
So the opportunity came, and I was always thinking about that: "what can I do to help my people?
I'm trying to improve infrastructure.
Actually it gets weirder.
And as we watched, they became frustrated and left to go find somebody to help on their own.
CO: Yeah, but we don't even know what houses are accepting help at this point.
CO: My car is in my living room.
I'm good at Facebook.
CO: I decided to stay in the country, give up the master's in Moscow and to work full-time to make this happen.
You build both gradually until a moment of peak mobilization at the time of the election.
MO: Data.
So that's what we're working on.
June 1st this year marked the one-year anniversary of the Monson tornado.
This is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela in Rio de Janeiro.
That's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week, but almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist, and we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week, close to 70 million people a year.
So -- "The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.
'Not one month, one day,' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu, who was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoction that is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation.
I thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong.
Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.' He meant back beyond that mountain of trash, back in the legal city, of legal buildings, with legal leases and legal rights.
That's also in Istanbul, Turkey.
Beer is all carried in on your shoulders.
People steal electrical power -- this is Rio.
That does not necessarily mean property rights, and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question, because property rights create a lot of complications.
You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes, provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.
He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood, and the people in the neighborhood, and is a great resource in the community.
And I thought to myself, "But that's what I want to do.
But let me tell you a bit about it today.
Mrs. Lois Doery, whom I later came to call my surrogate mum, read me many thousands of hours onto tape.
It's a Keynote Gold 84k, and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory.
Optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font, but by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers, he developed a machine that could read any font.
I can keep up with my friends.
I'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it.
But I wouldn't give up the technology, because it's allowed me to lead a great life.
But those books can't travel across borders.
I want that to happen.
This is why it's happening.
There's also a fascinating connection to cancer here, because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers.
It's also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma, which is just Alzheimer's disease of the eye.
I'm going to ignore their cautions and make one very specific forecast.
And we're creating a world where there is going to be more and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs.
Now, when I talk about this with my friends in Cambridge and Silicon Valley, they say, "Fantastic. No more drudgery, no more toil.
We are in the middle of an astonishing period.
So this is clearly bad news for Reuther.
But as the social researcher Charles Murray has documented, as we started to automate the economy, and 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses, as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy, the fortunes of Bill and Ted diverged a lot.
And what my friends in Silicon Valley and Cambridge are overlooking is that they're Ted.
So the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward.
So we see some green shoots that things are getting better.
But I actually don't think that's what we're going to do.
Abraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient.
And most people, both within and outside the organized church, still have a picture of a celestial controller, a rule maker, a policeman in the sky who orders everything, and causes everything to happen.
Finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning.
And if this is true, it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit, as well.
Many Jews and Christians now feel like this, I know.
In the second verse comes the line, "The wind and waves obey Him."
Either God is responsible for the tsunami, or God is not in control.
A cosmic us and them, and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism?
We cannot afford to pay so much for admission.
Maybe God doesn't do things at all.
In the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life.
By seeking the God within. By cultivating my own inwardness.
By seeking the inwardness which is in all things.
I want to talk about my investigations into what technology means in our lives -- not just our immediate life, but in the cosmic sense, in the kind of long history of the world and our place in the world: What is this stuff?
It was in 1829, and it was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum -- a course, bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts, and industry -- and he called it "Technology."
So, another way to think about technology, what it means, is to imagine a world without technology.
Well, that's because they're all young.
Because they had banker hours basically.
And if we don't have fire, we actually could not live.
It's not just hammers and gadgets, like laptops.
We actually don't know.
And there are things moving towards greater complexity, moving towards greater diversity, moving towards greater specialization, sentience, ubiquity and most important, evolvability: Those very same things are also present in technology.
This is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power.
And with that entire wealth of England, King Henry could not buy any antibiotics, he could not buy refrigeration, he could not buy a trip of a thousand miles.
You try it out.
And actually, in a certain sense, technology is a kind of a method for generating better ideas, if you can think about it that way.
And so, what technology gives us, over the long term, over the sort of extended evolution -- from the beginning of time, through the invention of the plants and animals, and the evolution of life, the evolution of brains -- what that is constantly giving us is increasing differences: It's increasing diversity, it's increasing options, it's increasing choices, opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.
Back in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn, I was trying to finish my first book, I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
And so they would talk to me about this and say, "You know, what we really need is just more people, more bodies, more one-on-one attention, more hours, more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one."
But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life.
So we rented this space.
Let's sell pirate supplies." This is the pirate supply store.
That was just my one thing -- I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads.
And we thought, "Oh, they're going to storm the gates, they're gonna love it." And they didn't.
You know, it's been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention, a student can get one grade level higher.
With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem.
And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.
So this is one of the books that they do.
So then they said, "Why don't you come into the schools?
Then another school said, "Well, what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?"
It's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it."
It's absolutely transformative.
And it became a gateway to the community.
These are all handmade.
So, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape, and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action.
It's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention, complete devotion to the students' work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas.
It's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it, and to have it checked, and to know he's going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day.
This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers.
I know that for a fact. So, tell us these stories and inspire others on the website.
This site will document every story, every project that comes out of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website, you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started.
You can tell them. You can shine that light on them, one human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us.
We only talk about one side of it.
It is very scary to go through that feeling of "I am about to die" or "I could die in this explosion."
We have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics, tactics, weapons, dollars and casualties.
How interesting.
That was her resistance.
There is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting, and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs.
We need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table.
A Congolese woman, who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them, and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them, how they're doing okay right now.
I humbly add -- humbly add -- that out beyond the worlds of war and peace, there is a field, and there are many women and men [who] are meeting there.
There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense.
So, I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity, and I went to the Gap, because I only have black pants.
They'll play it over, and over, and over.
I mean that simplicity sky.
Last month, I was at Google, and, boy, that cafeteria, man.
But looking way back, when I was a child -- you see, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.
And there was this person, Muriel Cooper.
And because of that, I always wondered about this human thing.
I spent my entire early career making complex stuff.
A very extreme culture.
You're the guy that makes eye candy."
I took these to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects.
So I focused on food as my area -- these sort of clementine peel things.
I wasn't sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint.
I'm a tenured professor, which means, basically, I don't have to work anymore.
Because that's what this is about. I have to simplify this thing.
Basically, it always depends.
And so, this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here, because life is finite.
And then the kids graduate, and you have no responsibility any more -- that's very good, too.
I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time, so -- well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar, I'm actually trying to lower the bar.
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives, we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this, we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.
And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global, or strategic, conflict.
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically -- doesn't look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the United States, minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.
If you agree with the factual analysis, but you don't feel the sense of urgency, where does that leave you?
If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture, we would still have this crisis.
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries. This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe.
The only two countries that didn't ratify -- and now there's only one. Australia had an election.
We now have a culture of distraction.
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying, "Oh, this is so terrible.
"Now, even lower emissions!"
Connect with people. Become very active as citizens.
But what we're going to talk about today is really design. Really good designers are like sponges: they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way, and transform it so that it can be used by people like us.
Other people are not as elastic.
So basically, the idea of being able to build things bottom up, atom by atom, has made them all into tinkerers.
Nanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance, have really opened the designer's mind.
I tell you, designers are quite fantastic, you know.
When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape, what should it be like?
One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale. We change scale very often: we change resolution of screens, and we're not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably.
It's only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first "pretty" -- if we can say so -- scientific presentations.
It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair, but you know what? One day it will take seven hours.
As the capacity of computers becomes really, really big, and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger, we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do in order to then retrace our path.
Some designers don't design objects, products, things that we're going to actually use, but rather, they design scenarios that are object-based.
Noam Toran and "Accessories for Lonely Men": the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad breakup, what you miss the most are those annoying things that you used to hate when you were with the other person.
So it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now.
But I'm hoping that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going -- which is always, hopefully, a portrait a few years in advance of where the world is going.
And I saw that there was information there.
We extracted the key bits on information to build the database.
We looked at Colombia, we looked at Afghanistan, and we looked at Senegal.
What we're saying here is the probability of an attack killing X number of people in a country like Iraq is equal to a constant, times the size of that attack, raised to the power of negative alpha.
Can we create the kind of patterns that we're seeing in places like Iraq?
And that is what we think is happening.
No one has seen this before. This is literally stuff that we've come through last week.
And so I'm thinking, right, great, it's going to keep going down.

And all the main religions have similar teachings.
Because, after all, God is just.
And so God put both of these possibilities into the world.
And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion, which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.
This "18 minutes" business, I find quite fascinating.
Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover, what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride, our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world, and that everything should revolve round us.
And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah.
Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself, "I'm an idiot. God wants bread?
Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things.
Now most of the time, you think of pain as a symptom of a disease, and that's true most of the time.
Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together.
But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story.
How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame?
But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation, amplification and, in the case of pain, the distortion of sensory experiences.
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time.
Thank you very much.
Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.
It broke up through atmospheric pressure, it crumbled, and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage.
This was 50,000 years ago, so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope, or something like that out in the desert, but it probably would not have caused global devastation.
Now, when these things blow up, they're not going to do global ecological damage.
Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur-killer for 65 million years. They're very rare.
They're hard to see, and the sky is really big.
And it's going to pass us so close that it's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites.
But we can't move the Earth, at least not easily, but we can move a small asteroid.
Imagine how hard that must be, and we did it.
You don't land on it, because these things are tumbling end over end. It's very hard to land on them.
Chemical rockets provide too much thrust, too much push. The probe would just shoot away.
This happened to them.
Sasha Vucinic: It's a great clip, isn't it?
You know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino.
But what they really do, which is very powerful, and that is what governments in the late '90s started doing if they don't like independent media companies -- you know, they threaten your advertisers.
In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.
It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country.
Media business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.
But it's one thing to have a concept; it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.
The government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in Bratislava.
A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers.
And here is the most stunning number.
And I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one, and depending on time I may give you two examples who we work with.
And I want to offer you a deal.
Luckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one, to get all the subscription lists, rehire staff.
Imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations.
I don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point.
You can, once you have all of those different points, you can make it easy for investors.
And in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms, no blind people running around to find each other.
We know a lot about four forces. There must be a lot more, but those are at very, very small distances, and we haven't really interacted with them very much yet.
Now our friend over there, Albert Einstein, used to pay very little attention when people said, "You know, there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity.
And suppose they have, you know, very different sensory apparatus, and so on.
And when the mathematics is very simple -- when in terms of some mathematical notation, you can write the theory in a very brief space, without a lot of complication -- that's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance.
And we keep doing that, and build more powerful machines, accelerators for particles.
Because they use mathematics we already have.
You rotate around the center of the circle, the circle remains unchanged.
But you can just look at the form. You can look at the form.
Now, here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of.
And therefore it looks beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely, concise way.
Four sources told it. That when they had the plague in Cambridge, and he went down to his mother's farm -- because the university was closed -- he saw an apple fall from a tree, or on his head or something.
And that's true of all the things we're talking about.
So, indeed, I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive.
Even as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams.
But there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death.
He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd, not certain he was ready to marry her, but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that.
"Everyone is broken by life," Ernest Hemingway once said, "but some people are stronger in the broken places."
For one thing, he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view.
But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception.
We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder, who laughed like the sunrise, who came from that place called America, which is so far from here, that if a young man should travel there, he would be an old man when he arrived.
So I was certain he would kick me out of the program.
But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman.
A victor in a thousand contests, three great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education.
In those last years, he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him.
The lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other, and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town, they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories.
"Oh, yes," he said, "perfectly appropriate place for him."
It makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention.
So I went to my father in tears, "What are we going to do?"
But luckily, my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest!
Thank you.
And it's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet.
Belshazzar, his son, decides to have a feast.
And Cyrus makes a declaration.
And more important, he will let them all recover the gods, the statues, the temple vessels that had been confiscated.
The Lord God be with him, and let him go up.'" "Go up" -- aaleh.
It was the largest empire the world had known until then.
And it enters now another story.
And, not surprisingly, they tell you that all this was done by Marduk.
God, we know, is usually on the side of the big battalions.
This time, the real politics of the contemporary world -- the year of the Balfour Declaration, the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain, decides that it will declare a Jewish national home, it will allow the Jews to return.
Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah.
And last year, the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time.
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed?
A replica of this is at the United Nations.
They communicate their delight to their children, who respond with smiles, and a desire to achieve more and to learn more.
It was hard to believe there were any children there at all, yet the director showed me into room after room, each containing row upon row of cots, in each of which lay a child staring into space.
If a child soils its nappy at 8:30, he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again.
When they leave the institution, they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society.
We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on, they recover their developmental delays, and go on to lead normal, happy lives.
Awareness-raising is required at every level of society.
I was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications.
Maybe I can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference.
You very quickly work out what is it that you've got to do to fathom that out.
And we wrote to heads of state, their ambassadors, Nobel Peace laureates, NGOs, faiths, various organizations -- literally wrote to everybody.
Could you give me a flight? Because we're going to go see him."
It wasn't about the end result.
The OAU at the time, led by Salim Ahmed Salim, said, "I must get the African countries involved."
And we were listening to everybody.
If this is the only film that I ever make, I'm going to document until this becomes a reality."
And now I was thinking, "Well, the press it really going to hear this story."
I'd spoken in Somalia, Burundi, Gaza, the West Bank, India, Sri Lanka, Congo, wherever it was, and they'd all tell me, "If you can create a window of opportunity, we can move aid, we can vaccinate children.
And UNICEF, God bless them, they said, "Okay, we'll have a go."
So Jude said, "Okay, I'll do some statements for you."
The other is you've got to have a constituency, you've got to have finance, and you've got to be able to raise awareness.
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere.
And then suddenly, I obviously knew at this point, there was a chance.
Obviously it was shown, and it was amazing.
And that made me think that, if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan, then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere.
We have to work together.
Would you go to governments and lobby and use the system?"
By working together, we can create peace one day.
This means that two brains of the same size, like these two, with a respectable 400 grams, should have similar numbers of neurons.
It seems quite vexing.
Although it weighs only two percent of the body, it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day.
Now, you may have heard or read somewhere that we have 100 billion neurons, so 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from.
Take rodents and primates, for instance: In larger rodent brains, the average size of the neuron increases, so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons.
So the human brain may be remarkable, yes, but it is not special in its number of neurons.
They just can't afford the energy for both a large body and a large number of neurons.
Nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate.
So because of cooking, what once was a major liability, this large, dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons, could now become a major asset, now that we could both afford the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them.
And I think that's how we got to become human.
I started my own experiments.
I was introduced to Robyn, the Swedish pop star, and she was also exploring how technology coexists with raw human emotion.
I've learned that there's no boundaries, and if I look at the evolution of my work i can see threads and connections that make sense.
This is the place where we make the legs.
Anyway, you know every time I make this speech -- it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion.
A bomb fell not far from my car -- well, far enough, but big noise.
So I took him into a safe place.
And then I said, "Oh, my God. What did I say?
Nothing can be done.
They were bombing -- not very close -- but you could hear the noise of the bombs.
So we started doing some repairs.
Mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs.
So we dashed, all of us, towards the shelter.
And I will never forget Mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair.
But I understood he wanted to tell me something.
I feel ashamed.
I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere.
I said, "Listen, it's insane.
The production was up 20 percent.
And you should see the faces of these people when they realize that those assisting them are like them.
And when you start, you cannot stop.
It is possible and it is not difficult.
And then I asked the usual question: "Is it a priority?

There was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle -- pitch black.
And it happened twice.
So when I speak of leadership, I'm not talking about just political leaders.
So he takes their radio, talks to their boss, and gets us all released.
They wanted us to think critically.
And it was brilliant to be part of this team.
But there were also some external factors: free markets, the rule of law, infrastructure.
Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy.
What is it about Ghana that produces leaders that are unethical or unable to solve problems?"
I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa.
And he signs off, "Thank you."
It's the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman has been elected head of Student Government at any university.
You know, that passion for what they're doing.
And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference.
In just over two years of operations, we've found over 1,200 potential new planetary systems around other stars.
That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes.
And so, we can't really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system.
Now, I prefer that term over magician, because if I were a magician, that would mean that I use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic.
You believe I'm looking at you.
I'm an actor who plays a specific part.
Now, to my innocent mind, dead implies incapable of communicating.
What does Granny say? She says, "I'm in heaven and it's wonderful.
Why do they insist on saying -- remember, they speak into this ear -- why do they say, "My name starts with J or M?"
There are hundreds of them all over the earth, but in this country, James Van Praagh is very big.
"Did he ever have an electric razor?" "No."
Now, Sylvia Browne is the big operator.
He just doesn't care.
She did this on the "Larry King Live" show on CNN six and a half years ago.
They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce.
I just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills.
Now folks, this is not just a metaphor I'm going to give you now, it's true.
It's a ridiculous thing. It is absolutely ridiculous.
I think that something needs to be done about this.
That's what they're looking at.
Now, we've offered this carrot, as I say, we've dangled the carrot.
It's a pretty expensive machine.
And finally, I think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong.
A woman came in, she needed an emergency C-section to save her life and the life of her baby.
And what's so frustrating is this is not a singular event; this happens across the developing world.
Here it is back at home at that same hospital, developed a little further, 12 years later, working on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics.
Now we know room air is gloriously free, it is abundant, and it's already 21 percent oxygen.
In both cases, whether you have power or not, sometimes the patient needs help breathing.
It has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts.
And it really seems peripheral, we never think about it, until we don't have access to it, and then it becomes a gatekeeper.
We offer a two-year diploma to talented students who have successfully completed their high school education.
This pictograph by the Jokwe people of Angola tells the story of the creation of the world.
It's a syllabary. It's not exactly an alphabet.
That is, until 1998, when one Yale professor John Coleman Darnell discovered these inscriptions in the Thebes desert on the limestone cliffs in western Egypt, and these have been dated at between 1800 and 1900 B.C., centuries before Mesopotamia.
It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.
Start with the notion that global warming is not only real, but dangerous.
Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom, but it's all in the way we use these things.
One: we don't need either of them for health.
The sad thing is, when it comes to diet, is that even when well-intentioned Feds try to do right by us, they fail.
Now, don't get me wrong.
Seriously.
And those moms bought and prepared food.
Back in those days, before even Julia, back in those days, there was no philosophy of food.
The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.
Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh, so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.
Meat consumption increased five-fold.
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.
But mostly they didn't eat broccoli.
By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets -- and we all have our favorites, actually -- made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home.
Can farm-raised salmon be organic, when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet, even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?
Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue, the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.
What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.
I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously -- one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years.
Cruelty: I knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we, hypocritically, wouldn't even consider for our own cats, dogs and other pets.
It was either you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian, and I guess I just wasn't quite ready.
On the weekend, your choice.
After all, if all of us ate half as much meat, it would be like half of us were vegetarians.
And what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would?
Here's Andy's theory.
Once you get that electronic tattoo, you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time, so as you go through this stuff, just be careful what you post.
She'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.
The annual death rate, then, becomes 56 million.
Now, the human cost of that is obvious, once you start to think about it -- the suffering, the loss -- it's also, economically, enormously wasteful.
But this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress -- burnt down, forever lost -- each year.
Similarly, the Astronomer Royal, whom we heard speak yesterday, also has a 50 percent probability estimate.
If we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe -- the Virgo supercluster -- maybe it will take us 100 million years to get there, but if we go extinct we never will.
Or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a great piece of art.
Here are a number of things that we don't want -- illness, involuntary death, unnecessary suffering, cruelty, stunted growth, memory loss, ignorance, absence of creativity.
If we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change?
We are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are, but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws, laws of chemistry, etc.
Modalities and special faculties.
But we are just literally deaf to that kind of value.
It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this.
There would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for, say, 200 years.
In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force in some sort of interplay with creative force.
And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces.
The sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun.
JH: Thanks guys.
So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are like radio-controlled airplane valves.
So the one on the right was done first, and then the one on the left was done over it.
JH: Is that a literal part of the image, or is my eye making that interference pattern -- is my eye completing that interference pattern?
And then there are all these forms that we don't know what they are, but they're equally well-resolved and complex.
And so I make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much, much simpler way.
TS: Nature is -- well, it's a godsend.
TS: Thank you, John.
And again, I get that feeling when we get a knock on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn, and my sister and I find a deliveryman with a box of pizza that we didn't order.
The man at the front desk laughs, and he says, "You can't reserve a room here. This is a homeless shelter."
Once upon a time, Scarlet was used as bait in dog fights.
And my childhood is more hick than I could ever possibly relate to you, and also more intellectual than you would ever expect.
So I should talk about art.
I'm going to organize it and direct it and get it going in the world.
So I started thinking about how am I going to do this biennial, how am I going to travel the world and find these artists?
It's going to be two years of studio work.
And I love to dig a hole.
So the next artist, this is a group of Japanese artists, a collective of Japanese artists -- in Tokyo.
I love this piece because I have a little cousin at home who introduced me -- which I think is such a great introduction -- to a friend one day as, "This is my cousin Shea.
And he makes a work that answers what they think great art is.
And this one's called "Lovemaking Nest."
And so they're valuable. This is precious metals and gemstones.
I talked my family into doing this, and they didn't know what I was doing.
And he plays with this idea.
And actually this is my Aunt Irene.
Next is Maynard Sipes.
He's an Australian Aboriginal elder, and he's also an artist.
And it's good that she's not real; she'd be mad that I said that.
My talk is "Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes."
It shows these women playing with these toys.
This, too, is origami, and this shows where we've gone in the modern world.
Origami revolves around crease patterns.
And if you want to go really crazy, 1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.
So let me stretch out that equation.
But we're going to start small.
Well, there are other ways of making a flap.
What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?
It's so simple that a computer could do it.
Or, really, any other kind of deer.
Toes have become an origami meme, because everyone's doing it.
It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope in 1995.
There were two groups of people who were interested in this: planetary scientists, who want to look up, and then other people, who wanted to look down.
So they looked into the origami community, we got in touch with them, and I started working with them.
This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University.
You know, where did these things come from?
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state with too much time on my hands.
We had a lot that got us excited.
It's got an amazing user experience.
You can see it in college graduation patterns, in job projections, in our marriage statistics, you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later, and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference, that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women.
I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.
And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.
So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them.
There we go.
It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn't have a college degree, but you had a specific set of skills, and with the help of a union, you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.
If you read management books now, a leader is somebody who can foster creativity, who can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say "his" -- who can get the employees to talk to each other, who can basically build teams and get them to be creative.
Why? This is a real mystery.
HR: So there you go.
They were men who had been contractors, or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom, and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.
And that really sent a shudder through the room.
And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child.
So we have the perpetual adolescent.
So for a long time in the economic sphere, we've lived with the term "glass ceiling."
There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables.
So for the longest time, all I would do is recall the memory of this person over and over again, wishing that I could get rid of that gut-wrenching, visceral "blah" feeling.
And also, there's way more cells in your brain than the number of straws in a typical haystack.
XL: So we clipped part of this sensor, and attached that to a switch to control the cells, and we packed this switch into an engineered virus and injected that into the brain of the mice.
Could we use, let's say, pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells?
Now to do that, first we need to trick brain cells to respond to laser beams.
They learn that something bad happened here.
XL: However, if you put the mouse in a completely different new box, like the next one, it will not be afraid of this box because there's no reason that it will be afraid of this new environment.
It's interesting.
We're really excited about this.
Now the next day, we can take our animals and place them in a red box that they've never experienced before.
In fact, we also have a light-controlled "off" switch, and it's very easy to imagine that by installing this light-controlled "off" switch, we can also turn off a memory, any time, anywhere.
SR: And finally, what do we make of all this?
I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and I didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the -- I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich, and it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk.
But this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed in the United States since 1956 say that their life is very happy.
And it describes how he feels when composing is going well.
We are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we're used to.
Well, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new, as this man is, he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels, or his problems at home.
It happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote, called "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical, very socially responsible.
And regardless of the culture, regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow.
If we know what that set point is, we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow, and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average.
The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal.
Thank you.
And if "Where do you come from?"
And I say all this just to stress how very old-fashioned and straightforward my background is, because when I go to Hong Kong or Sydney or Vancouver, most of the kids I meet are much more international and multi-cultured than I am.
And when I woke up the next morning, I was sleeping on a friend's floor, the only thing I had in the world was a toothbrush I had just bought from an all-night supermarket.
Certainly when I'm traveling, especially to the major cities of the world, the typical person I meet today will be, let's say, a half-Korean, half-German young woman living in Paris.
And home, we know, is not just the place where you happen to be born.
"Well —" Here my friend hemmed and hawed — "Well, actually it's a Catholic hermitage."
The whole place was absolutely silent, but the silence wasn't an absence of noise.
And the next day, when I woke up in the absence of telephones and TVs and laptops, the days seemed to stretch for a thousand hours.
And, of course, I'm not suggesting that anybody here go into a monastery.
Today, I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics.
Sticker templates.
In the industrialized world, people were healthy, educated, rich, and they had small families.
Just look how many.
So there they are.
I was in Shanghai recently, and I listened to what's happening in China, and it's pretty sure that they will catch up, just as Japan did.
Will they move on?
Every bubble is a country. The size is population.
They get soap, hygiene, education, vaccination, penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing.
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.
And they are not magnanimous in victory.
Within Britain, there is a gradient of health -- and this is what's called standardized mortality, basically your chances of dying.
Now, sunlight, of course, comes into this.
But if you give people vitamin D supplements, you don't change that high rate of heart disease.
What nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels, so it lowers your blood pressure.
It's not the heart. What do you do?
But what we found was that we couldn't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice.
Now, what we were careful to do was, vitamin D is made by ultraviolet B rays and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin D story.
So we've measured -- this is again, notice no tail and hairless, this is a medical student.
And you can look -- So, if you live on the equator, the sun comes straight overhead, it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere.
Edinburgh in summer, the area beneath the curve is pretty good, but Edinburgh in winter, the amount of NO that can be released is next to nothing, tiny amounts.
I actually think a far more important message is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight.
Yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago.
Trying to replace pancreas, trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's.
It's not really that foreign of a concept, actually; it happens on the Earth every day.
Actually, we can regenerate.
And then, six months later on the right-hand side you see this reengineered urethra.
It disintegrates a few months later.
What about other structures?
You now have your fully seeded scaffold.
They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs.
We place it back into this oven-like device.
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it.
That's the oven-like device; once it's coated it gets placed there.
All we are left with is the skeleton, if you will, of the liver, all made up of collagen, a material that's in our bodies, that will not reject.
And that's actually what you're seeing.
We are limited with distances right now, but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time.
So, we prefer organ-specific cells.
Once you get the formula right you can replicate it.
And when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question.
This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of.
Kids, when we grow up, have dreams, and we have passions, and we have visions, and somehow we get those things crushed.
What we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn't do: Don't hit; don't bite; don't swear.
Both my grandfathers were entrepreneurs. My dad was an entrepreneur.
Attention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder.
I stole essays. I cheated on exams.
But kids, you can see these signs in them.
He groomed us, the three of us, to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people.
And so I'll just go get them.
I sold newspapers.
It's like a recession. So, there's a recession.
Because then I realized I could make the money.
And then my dad would drive me on Saturdays to a scrap metal recycler where I got paid.
But what I realized was that you had to have options.
Because you can't sell them more.
That doesn't make any sense." You just figure out a way to make more money faster.
I'm like, screw that. They're all in the pond and nobody's going into the pond.
And then I had all the good ones that didn't look crappy. They were 50 cents each.
And I remember that lesson to this day.
They go around looking for what it is.
It drives me crazy that 30-year-olds are saying, "Maybe I'll start contributing to my RSP now."
Those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing.
They can come into your account or a sub account or whatever.
The same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression, unless it is so clinically brutal, man.
It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor.
Since education under the Soviet Union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology, they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women.
What kind of a world can we be making?"
When the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough, I can assure you, to give one pause, what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable.
And don't press your luck about how much those who do believe in it actually understand it.
Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective.
The challenge: to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference.
Mediation and improvisation also assume a special place in this new pantheon.
And of course, this new wine needs new bottles if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism of this idea.
Think of it as a kind of secular church.
You have a mind. And you have other people.
And indeed, this is just one of the examples of the junk that flows across the tubes in these Internets here.
That's it. Please save this.
They hold potluck dinners.
They want to regulate us, those conservatives, to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places.
So here's exhibit number one.
And then some people from Brooklyn saw it.
It should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party with a group of good friends.
All right, take for example this great company.
But apparently, no brains existed in this place when Democrats passed and signed this bill into law.
The creator doesn't have any rights.
And number three: We need to respect the creator, the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them.
I then got this email from YouTube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious WMG that matched their content ID.
I went to this site, and I had to answer these questions.
John McCain.
The value of freedom. It's a value of community.
So we see a lot of this.
And I had a major breakthrough when I met the psychologist Albert Bandura.
And it was really enjoyable, really interesting.
These people who had life-long fears of snakes were saying things like, "Look how beautiful that snake is."
That transformation is amazing.
But at one point he had a moment of crisis.
He would redesign the entire experience of being scanned.
Because you didn't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time, they could put more kids through the machine in a day.
But I decided and I committed to at this point to the thing I most wanted to do -- was to help as many people as possible regain the creative confidence they lost along their way.
So I hope you'll join me on my quest -- you as thought leaders.
The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.
From the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells, broke them open, and compared their gene sequences.
I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.
The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago, and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to.
He's dedicated his life to sustainable design.
When you walked into those rooms, they smelled really bad, and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before.
The brain works by association.
And he had a platform where you linked information to other information, and then you could call it up at will.
What he showed -- he sat on a stage like this, and he demonstrated this system.
And my company, OWL built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh.
You were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.
And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it, because his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything; it was just plain text.
There was a guy called Gary Kildall who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC, and he wasn't there, so they went back to see Bill Gates.
Basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web. You find some interesting content, say a TEDTalk, submit it to Reddit, and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it, vote it down if they don't.
And it wasn't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing and the rest of the Internet started saying, "Yes! We love Splashy Pants."
And people were putting up signs in the real world -- -- about this whale.
They even created an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy.
The other important thing is that it costs nothing to get that content online now.
I would like to show you how architecture has helped to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope.
Today, not so much has changed.
Since I was a student, I wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in Gando.
My people build all the time with clay, but they don't see any innovation with mud.
So I could do a lot of projects, and here I am going to share with you only three of them.
The community is very proud. We made it.
My most recent project in Gando is a high school project.
Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude.
And my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves.
By the end of every holidays, I had to say goodbye to the community, going from one compound to another one.
Good morning. So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve, to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow.
All right. Very significant mark.
MT: Well, as a matter of fact, it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards, and ever since that day, I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls, men and women, husbands and wives, even kings and queens.
Of course not! You've got to practice 24/7.
Voice: I think you got your birthday wish.MT: And that actually leaves me with the last, and most important card of all: the one with this very significant mark on it.
A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States.
This is an illusion.
The first is this: that China is not really a nation-state.
And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this: Of course we know China's big, huge, demographically and geographically, with a population of 1.3 billion people.
It divided, and it's remained divided ever since.
Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China -- maybe not sort of a comfortable one.
Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that, without the Han, China could never have held together.
And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy, because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy.
It's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West.
And the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas -- as we are familiar with -- with something like the one-child policy.
Unfortunately, I think, I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.
Whereas those cultures -- virtually the rest of the world, in fact, which have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West -- have been thereby forced to understand the West, because of the West's presence in those societies.
And there are two consequences of this.
Or take this: now this is an idea, but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing.
For 200 years, the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population.
Welcome to the future. Thank you.
And "BeatJazzers" become as common as D.J.'s.
So before going to law school in China I bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truck and I traveled down through Appalachia and I learned a bunch of old American songs, and I ended up in Kentucky at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention.
[Chinese] Outside your door the world is waiting.
[Chinese] And everybody's eyes just pop wide open like it's going to fall out of their heads.
[Chinese] "Big sister Wong," Washburn, Wong, same difference.
She said, "Hey, JR, your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world."
Each trip was an excursion, was an adventure.
I would change -- depending on the places I would go -- the title of the exhibition.
And then I saw it -- could it be possible? -- my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car -- a pasting I'd done a year earlier -- an illegal one -- still there.
They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves.
When we got there, we just went in the street, started talking with people everywhere, and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media.
The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."
Okay, for example, that's Palestine.
So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting.
Most of the places I went to, I decided to go there because I've heard about it through the media.
So we just walked around, and we met a woman, and I showed her my book.
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed.
And that's where the three kids got arrested, and that's the grandmother of one of them.
So they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them.
Don't you have color in France?"
Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict.
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?"
And most of what you see -- that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" -- its images, photography, taken one after the other.
And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela, we have a cultural center running there.
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks.
In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled.
This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally, and I pasted it in Southern Italy, where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.
I presume that you belong to the second category, and that's good, because for that project, I'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them.
When we act together, the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts.
Research is showing here, in the States, and in Canada and Western Europe, that most of us are much more open to local companies, or brands that maybe we haven't heard of.
For example, I want to use Zipcar.
And so they were very clever about the way that they packaged car-sharing.
But they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company.
And so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car?
They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services, because the two things that really work for car-sharing is, one, the car has to be available, and two, it's within one or two blocks of where you stand.
Because it just creates more flexibility.
So here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A., doing the things that gourmet food trucks do, and they've gathered quite a following.
There's this thing -- how many people here have heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?
But these sorts of things are happening in many different environments.
And one quick example is Velib, in 2007, came forward in Paris with a very bold proposition, a very big bike-sharing service.
So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride.
The future will be more unpredictable.
There are two Achilles' heels of globalization.
It will continue.
This is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford, from an embryonic stem cell.
The employment in the rich countries will go down from about 800 to about 700 million of these people.
This could be our best century ever because of the achievements, or it could be our worst.
We know, and I know from my own experience, that amazing things can happen, when individuals and societies come together to change their future.
And, you know, I got a lot of popularity.
All my seniors knew me. I felt really special.
And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me.
However, an 18 year-old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have a big patron or a big supporter.
I said, "I'm here to meet the Prime Minister."
I said, "Oh, my God. What is that?"
So I decided, I'm going to learn to paint by myself.
That's Pepe Linares, the renowned Flamenco singer.
The collaborative effort was fabulous.
They said, "Stop saying sorry. Say, my bad."
This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment.
So then I said, "Nets, what do I do?"
She made enough money, she sold off the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers, a company, everything, and she became my manager.
And they said you have to say bye to her, you have to do what you have to do.
The Bollywood stars who I would party with and buy my work disappeared.
I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl -- that's me there -- because she wanted a girl, and she has only boys.
This time I said let's try something different.
I teared up and I said that's where I want to be.
These are just different cartoons.
I whipped out my pen, and I started drawing on her head and I drew a crown for her.
Can you tell everybody your name?
SW: Yeah. She would get really, really excited.
E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat] SW: Yeah.
Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
E: [Squawks] SW: All right. Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier, but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem.
Because one of her favorite folks from back home is here, and she's pretty nervous to meet him.
E: Happy birthday to you.
E: Woo, woo, woo.
E: Ooooowww.
SW: That's good. Can you blow them a kiss?
When I was seven I went to summer camp.
So I dove through the inner tube, and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles.
And went from swimming one lap -- so 20 yards -- like a drowning monkey, at about 200 beats per minute heart rate -- I measured it -- to going to Montauk on Long Island, close to where I grew up, and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water, getting out and feeling better than when I went in.
And the turnaround in swimming came when a friend of mine said, "I will go a year without any stimulants" -- this is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy -- "if you can complete a one kilometer open water race."
So here are the new rules of swimming, if any of you are afraid of swimming, or not good at it.
But actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left, maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible.
Small flick, and the only purpose of that is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side.
My teachers assured me, they said, "Don't worry.
You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman.
And that's pretty much my response.
Ended up doing translation work at age 16 when I returned to the U.S., and have continued to apply this material over method approach to close to a dozen languages now.
So ballroom dancing, implicit versus explicit -- very important.
Immediately: death sweat.
She came back. She goes, "Come on. I don't have all day."
Then there were implicit commonalities that none of them seemed to be practicing.
So he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm.
Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do.
And if any of you are interested in that, I would love to speak with you.
And we felt the most important priority was to bring together two sets of problems.
And all of this will be done within the public system, funded by public money, but independently run.
And the business organizations thought we were onto something in terms of a way of preparing children much better for real-life work today.
This is one from Yorkshire where, in fact, my nephew, I hope, will be able to attend it.
And I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen.
And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes, and those microbes actually do us good much of the time, rather than killing us.
And that's what I've been doing for 20 years, using DNA sequencing, collecting samples from various places, including the human body, reading the DNA sequence and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place.
My first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave, right around the corner from here at Georgetown.
And so, people -- this is a study that I did now.
And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick, but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us.
Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them, maybe five species in them, and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species.
And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now is do detailed studies of, say, 100 patients who have Crohn's disease and 100 people who don't have Crohn's disease.
But the reason I'm telling you this is that the medical community, my father as an example, sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.
And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet.
A lot of people think in a very English-centric way on the Internet, but for us, we're truly global. We're in many, many languages.
or "Who does that?" And the answer is: anybody who wants to pitch in.
And that's essentially our main cost.
It started out with an article in Red Herring.
The real struggle is not between the right and the left -- that's where most people assume -- but it's between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks.
It's a social concept of cooperation, so we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity.
So as soon as he made his change, it went to the recent changes page.
The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people.
The example I've got up here is a Votes For Deletion page.
So somebody says, "Delete it, please. Delete it -- it's not notable."
Like I say, it's a tight knit community.
And so you've got a hint of that when I mentioned, like, Rick Kay's voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don't know.
It just isn't appropriate.
I mean, this could happen and what if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote?"
Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers, and how do you see Wikipedia changing education?
So, this is the short story of that research.
After 1,300 years, these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb.
And the second question was, "Have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you?"
I remember what you said to me.
How many people have suffered in all the millions of years of human evolution?
It's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain, associated with wanting, with motivation, with focus and with craving.
So, right now, Lucy Brown and I, the neuroscientist on our project, are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped.
In this case, life's greatest prize: an appropriate mating partner.
Like hunger and thirst, it's almost impossible to stamp out."
I would also like to tell the world that animals love.
And I just simply say, "Hardly."
I never would have even thought to think of this, but Match.com, the Internet-dating site, came to me three years ago and asked me that question.
And I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree you express dopamine, serotonin, estrogen and testosterone.
Indeed, we carry a lot of luggage from our yesteryear in the human brain.
I think it comes from millions of years of standing behind that -- sitting behind the bush, looking straight ahead, trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock.
Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure, my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows.
I also worked with many different types of wood, such as maple, yew and mulberry, and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before.
Through bowmaking, I came in contact with part of my heritage.
Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being, and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow.
And we know they use some of that brainpower for just living complicated lives, but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence?
Now, it's not a bad place to be a researcher, either.
And like all the dolphins in our community, we photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots and nicks in her dorsal fin, and also the unique spot patterns as she matured over time.
And sound can actually be felt in the water, because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same.
You know, I've been buzzed in the water.
Now, researchers have actually measured whistle complexity using information theory, and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages.
So we wanted to develop an interface like this in the Bahamas, but in a more natural setting.
But when we don't dive down and get it, they'll bring it to the surface and they'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail and drop it for us like they do their calves, and then we'll pick it up and have a game.
And the dolphins could get in on the game.
Let's see if they might actually understand what that means.
And we try to not touch the animals too much, we really don't want to over-habituate them.
And because of this, we really decided we needed some more sophisticated technology.
It's designed to really be two-way.
It's called "All the Answers."
And the song is based on what I think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces.
He's acting as a human fuselage, so to say.
He's starting to make his climb.
And now he's in Edinburgh. Yves Rossy.
It's really an unreal feeling, because normally you have a big thing, a plane, around you.
It's very short and only in one direction.
It is purely your body, and the wings become part of the body and vice versa?
Describe for me the equipment since you have it here.
Two parachutes.
I thought, okay, I will go out.
YR: Exactly. There is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons: so I can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that, just on his head.
We have a hundred years of experience.
It's well said. It's well said.
And I came back afterward on the sled of the helicopter back.
Yves, one last question.
In every aspect of their lives, they wished for progress, just as we do.
But isotopes, particles of electricity, antimatter, neutrinos, the conversion of mass to energy -- that's E=mc^2 -- gamma rays, transmutation.
What were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid, open-ended discovery?
"Take no one's word for it."
In what language? Certainly not the language of mathematics, in which, Galileo rightly said, the book of nature is written.
But we know about those things.
What we see, in all these cases, bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible -- only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them.
So we perceive nothing as what it really is.
I don't just mean a logical defect. I mean a bad explanation.
And that is possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons, except via the myth itself.
If the ancient Greeks had found out about seasons in Australia, they could have easily varied their myth to predict that.
But the more important one is explanationless theories.
But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction.
In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.
So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.
And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.
What was this place called Minto?
And soon they were all dancing this joyous, exuberant dance right there on their lawn.
The work they did was very, very high art, and stars came along like Laurie Anderson and Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage who made work for this circuit, and you had these seminal shows like "The Mahabharata" and the monumental "Einstein on the Beach."
They understand that theater and performance can happen anywhere.
Royal de Luxe's giant puppets come into a city and they live there for a few days.
Lyn Gardner in The Guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world, a map of the city and a map of ourselves, but there is no one fixed festival model.
Playing with the world, and our perception of it, really is the essence of visual effects.
["Academy Award Winner for Visual Effects"] Second doctor: Welcome to your new body, Jake.First doctor: Good.
National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you.
So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me.
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on.
When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears.
These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear.
But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner.
And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water.
Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water.
And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal.
They're also big.
I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide.
It's time for you to get in the water."
I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips.
The penguin swims toward me, takes off.
So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this.
She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me.
Thank you.
For example, how many of you still have your cell phones on you right now?
So, without looking at your phone, what time was it?
By a show of hands, were you right?
If you don't attend to something, you can't be aware of it.
He accesses the file. He has to rewind the tape.
It's hard to tell where to start, there's so many great things.
Can you stand right over this way for me?
So let's do this simply. Squeeze your hand.
See, while we're focused on the hand, it's sitting on your shoulder right now.
You were focused on your hand. That's why you were distracted.
It's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?
Yeah, it's funny. We've got a little guy. He's union. He works up there all day.
Can I feel the outside of your pocket for a moment?
So, same question I asked you before, but this time you don't have to close your eyes.
It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time.
All the while, we also wanted to give back to the local tech community that helped us grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days.
There is more that we're doing to explore this idea of collective intelligence, that I, as a citizen, if I share the information with whatever device that I have, could inform you about what is going on, and that if you do the same, we can have a bigger picture of what's going on.
Now, this is the reality of Kenya, where we live now, and other parts of Africa.
We've built a crowd map, we've built Ushahidi.
So why don't we leverage that? And that's why we built this.
And for us, we begin with solving the problem in our own backyard in Kenya.
Over the past six months, I've spent my time traveling. I think I've done 60,000 miles, but without leaving my desk.
When I'm joking, I try and explain it happened at midnight, you see, while we were asleep, but it was midnight 15 years ago. Okay?
It makes no sense. Companies make their expensive executives spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets which are obsolete or need changing before they can be published.
It says -- I'll put on the voice -- "In summary, your Majesty, the failure to foresee the timing, extent and severity of the crisis was due to the lack of creativity and the number of bright minds," or something like that.
What we do know is that the world has accelerated.
And then we've done a third thing.
What he did was, he got a transparent pipe — have you seen this demonstration before? — he attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was, you had a situation where — I'll try and draw the tap and the pipe, actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard.
He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens.
So I'll put a little line up here which represents learning, and that's how we used to do it. We could see things, understand them, take the time to put them into practice.
It's called smart failure. Why? Because you can't put it on your C.V.
Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country.
We need to look for something else, and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut.
You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.
And what it basically implies is that, in houses now, we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things, as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building.
So I want to leave you with one last impression about the project, or this kind of work and using smart materials.
It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience.
So here's the description of a group I found on the Web.
But I'm here today to give you a choice.
Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds, and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others.
The first one is harm/care.
It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate, join together into groups, but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups.
This painting is called "The Allegory Of Chastity," but purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality.
And my colleagues, Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham, and I, made a questionnaire, which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org.
For liberals, the scores are very low.
Notice also that on all of these graphs, the slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity.
We get every person doing whatever he wants, with every aperture of every other person and every other animal.
And what happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative -- and this is all played anonymously.
It's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives.
It's not that complicated.
They say "No, let's celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership."
They want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom.
You find the same thing in Hinduism.
Now unfortunately, it's a disease that has been caught by many of the world's leaders.
People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place.
If Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example, we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go.
Say this person approaching here, and they say, "Well is this a suicide bomber or not?
So again, they would say, "Well if we have access to non-lethal weapons, if we've got someone we know is hostile, we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place, at least, again, we're not going to kill them."
It's sort of your classic idea of a heat ray.
In particular, the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different.
And of course, being Australian, I started looking at stuff in Australia, knowing, again, from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia.
I could only find these ones.
This person is not doing anything violent, but they just won't do what we want them to.
So Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater.
So when they had a look at it afterward, there were only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation.
Another problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use non-lethal weapons and get trained about them and then get tested and so on.
In fact, he was probably six inches taller than me, and she was about this tall.
And they clearly learned a lot from it because in the same district, "Police review policy after children shocked: 2nd child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks."
"She took up a more threatening position in her bed."
So if you threaten to use it, people are going to comply with it, but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects."
So makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs; they're people who love doing what they do.
DD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out.
I don't know if this is called a basket-bra, but it ought to be something like that.
Choir: I'm hooked on a feelin' I'm high on believin' That you're in love with me DD: So Richard came up from Houston last year to visit us in Detroit here and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.
They want to use it to their own purpose.
With our strengths and our minds and spirit, we gather, we form, and we fashion.
This is Andrew Archer.
And that's why he moved to Michigan.
Now that could be a dog door, it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't, like a little brother into a little sister's room.
Well you printed out the brackets and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones.
Think how much money and how many years it took NASA to get satellites into space.
There's a great opportunity today -- and that's what I really care about the most.
A magazine?
We know everyone who starts a business in a garage ends up founding Hewlett-Packard.
It wasn't glamour as a quality -- you "cast a glamour."
But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy -- about whom we'll hear more later -- there's a lot more to it.
And I think that that's starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is.
Mel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" -- not glamorous.
Aside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous, one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.
The same thing -- arches are very glamorous.
There's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today, after a few centuries.
We don't tell you all the grubby details.
And there she is -- Grace.
It has that sense of going up and away, and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were -- particularly going down.
This is not always good, because what is your perfect world?
I'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad.
So glamour can be dangerous.
There is a book out in the bookstore -- it's called "Symphony In Steel," and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.
For a long time, there was me, and my body.
I worried that [if] I took my hat off I wouldn't be here anymore.
It scared me, it energized me, and then I became a driven person, a driven vagina.
If I was tired, I drank more espressos.
It became entertainment; it became a new kind of commodity, something I was selling.
All the stories began to bleed together.
In his new and visionary book, "New Self, New World," the writer Philip Shepherd says, "If you are divided from your body, you are also divided from the body of the world, which then appears to be other than you or separate from you, rather than the living continuum to which you belong."
I know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation, the 16 ounces of puss, is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico, and there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me and dead floating fish.
And my friend was preparing this big bowl, and I said, "What is it?"
It was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion.
It was the Congolese women who are now rising up.
It was a million prayers.
And put another way, the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds, our brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells, that we share with all other animals, with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs.
So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains, whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts.
It takes children a long time to break into the system.
And Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest.
RS: That one is Joshua's. That's right.
So that's a five-year-old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions.
So the three-year-old does two things differently.
Yeah.
So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory, and they take a break for coffee.
The powder is still sugar, but what's different is what Grace thinks.
So what I'm showing you, from left to right, is how much activity there was in this brain region, and from top to bottom, how much blame people said that Grace deserved.
When you hear clicks, we're turning the machine on.
But in the case of a failed attempt to harm, where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar, people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee.
So, I have a question. When you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments, that sounds alarming.
So it's not a surreptitious technology.
We knew how brains see, and how they control the body and how they hear and sense.
Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock.
I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples, and they're amusing and good to laugh at.
And this went on for some time, until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people.
I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture, and what it was doing to me and to everyone else.
Whereas in the West, time is linear.
And thankfully, the answer is yes, because what I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best.
And in this, towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape, so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another.
I was coming to -- well -- no pun intended there.
Homework is another thing. There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years, and now they're discovering that less can be more.
I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time.
Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason -- why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down.
Now, one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out, is the reaction to it.
But I've also, over the last year or so, got in touch with my inner tortoise.
And because children have their own tempo and internal clock, they don't do quality time, where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you.
And I thought, "Aw, that's really sweet.
Unfortunately, though, the site was separated from the river by McLean Boulevard so I suggested, "Let's reroute McLean," and that gave birth instantly to Friends of McLean Boulevard.
And here's the building as it opened, with a channel overlooking downtown, and as seen from downtown.
I worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it because I felt people were coming out of the historic museum, they are totally saturated with information and to see yet another museum with information, it would make them just unable to digest.
He is on a state visit. We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem, we took him to the children's memorial; he was extremely moved.
The pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands -- they're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there.
And half a million people gathered for the celebrations; you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning.
You cross a bridge, you enter this triangular room, 60 feet high, which cuts right into the hill and extends right through as you go towards the north.
That too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on.
And here studying, in three dimensions, how to give some kind, again, of order, a structure; not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process.
I didn't realize there was going to be a little music before.
But that could have happened -- maybe, maybe not.
See, these are all right inside of the color palette.
So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake.
So there is no mistake.
You have some people who do.
So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity, the first step for me is to be patient, to listen to what's going on and pull from something that's going on around me.
Greetings to all of you from Pakistan.
My name is Ahmed. I am an Afghan refugee from the Khyber agency.
Our collective vision at Naya Jeevan, which for many of you, as you all recognize, means "new life" in Urdu and Hindi, is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care.
It felt like it was really important.
If you're in IT, India, obviously, is the place to be at the moment.
It's probably the best place in the world to see them.
Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean.
And one thing you need to know about dragonflies, one important thing, is that they lay their eggs in fresh water.
So it's essentially a freshwater animal.
Didn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't.
And again I didn't think too much of it.
Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains, the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.
You're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on.
And the first thing I did was started recording when they turned up in the Maldives.
Seemed a bit unlikely.
Then Malé, then further south.
I got on my bicycle, and I cycled around the island of Malé.
What are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year to their apparent doom?
They only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks.
And it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa, where it's raining.
Here, here, Kenya, East Africa, they've actually just come out of a long drought.
The sun is overhead, maximum heating, maximum evaporation, maximum clouds, maximum rainfall, maximum opportunities for reproduction.
Those of you from North America will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly.
But it's also called the Amur Falcon.
But then the being sensible stopped.
He was flying off the coast of Goa, 21 years ago, 1988. October, 1988.
So, that's what I've done with my life.
This is a casper slide, where the board's upside down.
It was gone. They took my pro model off the shelf, which was essentially pronouncing you dead publicly.
So, humbling as it was, I began again.
Because that had not yet been done. And then it dawned on me, and here's part of what I'm saying.
Okay, so when you're skating, and you take a fall, the board slips that way or that way. It's kind of predictable.
And indeed I did. It was the very first thing I filmed, which was awesome.
As you adjust, you punch it up, and then when I would do that, it was throwing my shoulder this way, which as I was doing it, I was like, "Oh wow, that's begging for a 360 flip," because that's how you load up for a 360 flip.
And skaters, I think they tend to be outsiders who seek a sense of belonging, but belonging on their own terms, and real respect is given by how much we take what other guys do, these basic tricks, 360 flips, we take that, we make it our own, and then we contribute back to the community the inner way that edifies the community itself.
More safe, more secure. You can be an iOS hacker, make your iPhone do stuff it wasn't supposed to.
In fact, one of them, he was Ernst &amp; Young's Entrepreneur of the Year for San Diego County, so they're not, you never know who you're dealing with.
And it gives you that clarity of perspective of, man, I'm just me, and popularity, what does that really mean again? Not much.
It's just that I'm in front of a very privileged audience.
KH: Right. Thank you. Good job. RM: Thank you. Thank you.
And the man's name is Carl Norden.
It weighs about 50 lbs.
Here was an army that had just had experience in the First World War, where millions of men fought each other in the trenches, getting nowhere, making no progress, and here someone had come up with a device that allowed them to fly up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy.
And what did the Norden bombsight do?
And there's a little incendiary device inside of it, so that, if the plane ever crashes, it will be destroyed and there's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it.
Thirdly, when Norden was making his calculations, he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes.
And then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was, there was a famous case in 1944 where the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna, Germany.
So they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war -- which also, by the way, didn't work very well.
In the Iraq War, at the beginning of the first Iraq War, the U.S. military, the air force, sent two squadrons of F-15E Fighter Eagles to the Iraqi desert equipped with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor.
Now what is the accuracy of those drones?
And this is the problem with our infatuation with the things we make.
He was a committed Christian.
So I can give you a little bit of first background just on me and what moved me as a -- really going back as far as a teenager and then an adult, to actually try and build this kind of thing.
And so for me, I know that when the Internet came around and I was doing computer programming and just, you know, just generally trying to run my own little company and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers, I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers would be to use the Internet and connected computers to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together -- the sort of -- the idea of atoms and how to make things, and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff.
If you think about going into space, it's a fascinating thing.
And in fact, it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth that anything is going to be possible.
It's about 20,000 computers connected together in three facilities in the United States right now, that are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself -- there's about 250,000 people a day that are wandering around in there, so the kind of, active population is something like a smallish city.
The Web puts information in the form of text and images.
And I think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years -- you know, that 3D, that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us.
You know, mapping in India -- that's such a great example.
Philip Rosedale: I think that's great. That's such a deep question. Yeah.
PR: I'm sure I can think of multiple examples of both of those.
And we had -- we zoned it, you know: we put a nightclub, we put a disco where you could dance, and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to, and we had another place that was like a boardwalk, kind of a Coney Island.
So of course, we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or, you know, taking two avatars and merging them, or something.
JH: The observation is, Philip has been accused of looking like a character, an avatar, in Second Life.
JH: Other questions? Right here.
So that's another demographic fact.
I suspect that's possibly a euphemism for C student who spent a lot of time in his room? Is it possible?
JH: You want to paraphrase that?
So this change, I believe, is a huge disruptive change.
So, I guess it is a result of globalization that you can find Coca-Cola tins on top of Everest and a Buddhist monk in Monterey.
And the night before, we camped, and my Tibetan friends said, "We are going to sleep outside." And I said, "Why? We have enough space in the tent."
It's about two meters by three, and you are all welcome any time.
I can hear it two, three, five times.
It is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment, a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states, and all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way.
There might be storms, but the depth of the ocean is still there, unchanged.
So now, look at inner conditions. Aren't they stronger?
The experience that translates everything is within the mind.
Just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature.
Likewise, behind every single thought there is the bare consciousness, pure awareness.
So that's the way to proceed. Rejoicing compared to jealousy.
So, the interface with cognitive science, since we need to come to that, and it was, I suppose, the subject of -- we have to deal in such a short time with brain plasticity. The brain was thought to be more or less fixed.
They are real Olympic champions of mind training.
The bell curve shows 150 controls, and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe.
Hopefully, they will come.
We are ready to spend 15 years achieving education.
And just, I leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than I could ever say.
You see some incredible stuff.
First one is really a question of origins.
I'm asking about our human ancestry, things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room.
What do I mean by that?
The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus, Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist, who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet.
But based on what data?
You gradually trace further and further back into the past, adding these ever more distant relationships.
And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.
And you're working away until late at night, and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention, but, occasionally, when you're copying this by hand, you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake -- substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.
Everybody in this room, everybody in the world, falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.
Now, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?
We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago, but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough, getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.
The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.
The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.
This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa, and they allowed us to start to expand around the world.
Migrating eastward, following the grasslands, because that's what they were adapted to live on.
You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA, and we want to take it to the next level.
It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.
The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public; 210,000 people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago, which has raised around five million dollars, the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.
And now they're going to be poured back into the egg.
Eric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone, there are some 10 billion SKUs, or distinct commodities, being traded.
We refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments.
There's not even time or space.
And energy does something else quite magical: it congeals to form matter -- quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons.
Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that, in fact, there are just tiny differences in that background.
And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex.
In the center of a star, there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again.
Well, planets are great, and our early Earth was almost perfect.
Each rung contains information.
So DNA's learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity.
Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago.
We are blessed with a language, a system of communication, so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory.
Farming was an energy bonanza.
I hope you agree that this is a powerful story.
So let's think about how we manage our money.
These losses, they feel, emotionally, they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up."
I see a lot of hands coming down.
We're not doing a great job managing money.
They cannot make savings easy.
Two thirds are not saving now.
That's what I really want to focus on.
Well that's at least what one wonderful study predicted.
What's the difference?
In Germany, 12 percent check the box.
In too many 401 plans, if people do nothing, it means they're not saving for retirement, if they don't check the box.
This is the notion of loss aversion.
If people have to check a lot of boxes to join a 401 plan, they're going to keep procrastinating and not join.
Save More Tomorrow makes it easy.
We first implemented it, Richard Thaler and I, back in 1998.
Whereas with saving three percent, people might have to add nice sneakers so they can walk, because they won't be able to afford anything else, when they save 14 percent they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes to walk to the car to drive.
Behavioral finance has a long way.
In the spirit of TED, we're bringing you something that has not been released.
It was 19 degrees in St. Louis about a month ago and I'm happy to report that this performance you are seeing today is the earliest we have ever performed.
I I got I got kicked I got kicked in the head backstage at the Stone. Stone Pone. Stone Pony. I got kicked in the head backstage at the Stone Pony where I swore to the guy that the guy who took his beer wasn't me. Me got Me got kicked Me got kicked in the head backstage at the Stone. Stone Pone. Stone Pony. Me got kicked in the head backstage at the Stone Pony where I swore to the guy that the guy who took his beer was a guy dressed like me. Not me! Not me! Not me! Thank you.
Hello. Who's there, please?
What's your question, please?
Of Nations!"
And I could see everybody looked at me, somebody said, "Bollywood."
You're a director, you've done it for years."
I don't even know if it's truthful.
And I say, "Cate, what do you want to do?"
Out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity.
And I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?"
And I don't know why, but I remember the story.
We are the stories we tell ourselves.
We create stories to define our existence.
When I made the sequel to "Elizabeth," here was a story that the writer was telling: A woman who was threatened by Philip II and was going to war, and was going to war, fell in love with Walter Raleigh.
They said, "We won the Armada."
So let me show you a film -- a piece from that film -- and how a camera also -- so this is a scene, where in my mind, she was at the depths of mortality.
Are you with child?
You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business.
You no longer have the queen's protection.
It'll survive her.
So how do I start all this?
There's a mythology in India about -- where they say, and I'll say it in Hindi, [Hindi] Right. What does that mean?
But I can go on about telling you how we evolve stories, and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that I am in, which is film.
It's the effect of looking for harmony in the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind, a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind.
It is finite; harmony is infinite.
Points out the window.
But you fuck one goat ... " Storytelling -- is joke telling.
We all know what it's like to not care.
And he's summoned by his rich uncle, John Carter, to his mansion with a telegram saying, "See me at once."
It confirmed something I really had a hunch on, is that the audience actually wants to work for their meal.
I first started really understanding this storytelling device when I was writing with Bob Peterson on "Finding Nemo."
I took a seminar in this year with an acting teacher named Judith Weston.
And Woody's was to do what was best for his child.
So we're all learning all the time.
But more importantly, have you made me want to know how it will all conclude in the long-term?
We didn't have any influence then, so we had a little secret list of rules that we kept to ourselves.
Another fundamental thing we learned was about liking your main character.
We're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along, as long as certain conditions are met.
And it wasn't until, on one of my later viewings, that the veil was lifted and it was in a scene where he's walked across the Sinai Desert and he's reached the Suez Canal, and I suddenly got it.
Thumper: Come on. It's all right.
Wonder is honest, it's completely innocent.
And he explained that when I was born, I was born premature, that I came out much too early, and I wasn't fully baked; I was very, very sick.
I promise, I will never let anything happen to you, Nemo.
I was going to work with small farmers.
I assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them.
Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise.
We needed to be working on soy -- things that we were not focused on.
We may be able to use them differently.
For bankers, we'd be living off the principal, not the interest.
You think that's not a question as to how we should be using the Earth's resources?
We're not going to be able to do that.
If they should all be sustainable on a finite planet, how do you make that happen?
Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef?
We need to focus on the where, the what and the who.
I don't see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively.
In fact, these names start coming up over and over again.
By companies asking for this, we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it.
In salmon aquaculture, we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago.
They care about availability, so the big risk for them is not having product at all.
They've funded research that shows that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years, and do it all in Borneo alone by planting on land that's already degraded.
All the palm oil going there is good.
But they're not just buying the juice; they're also buying the carbon in the trees to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon to get the product into Europe.
Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine.
And when you go home, think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better."
To reach clinical fruition rapidly, it was obvious: I had to think about the problem differently.
Imagine that the locomotor system is a car.
Immediately, the paralyzed rat can stand.
Imagine, this is really cool.
But you know, one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance.
We are creating the next generation of M.D.'s and engineers capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside.
At the same time, we will implant an electrode array, a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement, and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulations that are tailored to the person's needs.
Can you believe that?
I was raised on the South Side of Chicago.
And my brother and I were raised with all that you really need: love, strong values and a belief that with a good education and a whole lot of hard work, that there was nothing that we could not do.
And not only to invest in your own home but to reach out and help raise kids in the broader community.
What he said, that all too often, is that we accept the distance between those two ideas.
And that's why getting a good education is so important.
I liked being smart.
And it won't be easy -- that's for sure.
Because we are counting on you.
Please welcome Claron McFadden.
I can't make noise.
It's called "Aria."
There's Armenian, Russian, French, English, Italian.
I don't know. As a simple example, we could run a test here.
No CEO, no firm responsible, singly, for building it.
It's very complicated, but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly.
You need a lot of trust, but it's not like, "I'm trying to get to Pensacola, please."
So, for example, last year, the government of Pakistan asked its Internet service providers there to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube.
Then, at moment number two, you have the fake announcement go out.
And here is the message where one of them says, "Looks like we've got a live one. We have a hijacking of YouTube!
Example number two: Wikipedia.
I have a theory I can explain later.
It does make you wonder if there were, for instance, a massive, extremely popular Star Trek convention one weekend, who would be minding the store?
You could see arguments on both sides.
I mean, this is a 2005 Business Week cover.
Is that an animal carcass behind her?"
And then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later, this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big, if you don't mind.
Here is the chart of over 43 people helping to steer the robot that could not steer and get it on its way, from one corner from one corner of Washington Square Park to another.
CouchSurfing: one guy's idea to, at last, put together people who are going somewhere far away and would like to sleep on a stranger's couch for free, with people who live far away, and would like someone they don't know to sleep on their couch for free.
It's saying, "Let's march." Thank you very much.
And we took a very special angle to this.
You can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia; Finland in Europe; Canada in North America doing really well.
We all want to be there, in the upper right quadrant, where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed.
And I'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students.
Last but not least, Koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop.
But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once, and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well.
And the bitter truth really is that, you know, not in many countries.
And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about optimizing existing policies, but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying German education.
And, of course, the question is, can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere?
Those things really exist.
In the past, different students were taught in similar ways.
And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers.
High-performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive.
Last but not least, those countries align policies across all areas of public policy.
It has helped countries to see that improvement is possible.
Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years.
And that is the real network effect.
And we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks; we could update each other more often.
So naturally, I -- the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty.
And I couldn't find much, really, but I found this graph produced by the ITU, which is the International Telecommunication Union, based in Geneva.
And of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down, because there's a digital revolution going on, then it would be even more dramatic.
And that leads to specialization.
The car pays for itself.
But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures.
Because some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank, get a phone and have the phone for everybody.
To make the story short, here is the coverage of the country.
It increases income, improves welfare, etc.
"Poor people are recipients."
And as I was trying to show you, as far as I'm concerned, aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens.
The course was good, but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset.
And that, to me, that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mindset I grew up with was changed.
And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know?
The size of the bubble here is the population.
But 1850 had already been many, many years of foreign domination, and India had been de-industrialized.
United Kingdom is going down.
In 1947 India finally gained its independence.
China recovered. Then they said, "Nevermore, stupid central planning."
And the market reformer was successful there.
But on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest inland provinces of China, is there.
If you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with, than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living.
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer.
You see it came down there.
Japan did it like this, until full catch up, and then they follow with the other high-income economies.
But they ain't going to pay for what others, who have more money, have largely created, and I can agree on that.
Get your bookings in time. Thank you very much.
It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum, which is what we use to detect things.
So we have these stars going around in circles like this.
And this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster.
Now, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?
Is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy?
If they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.
And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper -- I'm a physicist.
And so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.
OK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following.
They're not necessarily moving through space.
The startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments, was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago, OK.
Now, what do I mean by well motivated?
So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector.
The big questions facing physics.
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy.
TM: Thank you very much.
And the injection is so valuable, that the people basically trust the doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times, to do the right thing. But in fact they're not.
And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals, wash them, and in the course of this, obviously picking them up they injure themselves.
They squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent.
You probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa are infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty, and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well.
Here I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline to think about problems of another.
That is a huge effect.
These are just tiny decreases -- two percentage points -- not significant.
People really like to have sex.
So one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there's less malaria.
But it also tells us something about policy.
The reason that we know that the ABC campaign was effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time.
It kills people in the prime of their lives.
You can see, almost without exception, the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates.
What I really want to do, is I want to use this new data to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower.
The epidemic was introduced to the US by actually one male steward on an airline flight, who got the disease in Africa and brought it back.
And we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there.
There was a big decline in coffee prices.
Trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases.
And what's really, really great about being here is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very, very different than the questions that I think up myself.
There is lots of showing off.
He would come every day with something to show me.
We're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones to try to optimize packing space, or to waterproof, or to try to heat and cool a structure.
They're the people who make the bullet train.
Made it go 10 percent faster on 15 percent less electricity.
And that pattern, the architecture of that pattern on its skin denticles keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere.
There is actually a scientist here at Oxford who studied this, Andrew Parker.
None of these are using the organisms.
Actually G.M. Opel used it to create that skeleton you see, in what's called their bionic car.
In our world we use about 350 polymers to make all this.
One of the largest consultants are the social insects.
You know we use PVC, and we sheath wires with PVC for insulation.
At Biomimicry Guild, which is my consulting company, we work with HOK Architects.
And we are in a long, long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves, "How can we live here gracefully over the long haul?"
And that information will go into AskNature.org.
And you can't tell the story about pollinators -- bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies -- without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years.
And I thought that they'd probably say, "Well, it's all about sex."
Here are some images from the film.
They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents, and girls would be dolled up to get married.
So this is the foundation time which I got.
And the second thing, which has stayed with me, which became my philosophy of life, which made all the difference, is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.
I'm a product of opportunities, rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s, which girls didn't get, and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique.
But I decided no, it's a power to prevent, because that's what I learned when I was growing up.
And the rule was, because I was sensitive, I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice, and I was very pro-justice.
I said, "Do you pray?"
This was initiated in Delhi prison.
Everything was donated, because there was no budget of education for the prison.
You want to know more about this, go and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana."
This is a feedback box called a petition box.
That's a big way we, as a small group of activists, have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India.
That thing is called a CAPTCHA.
This person thought they needed to wait.
Another way of putting it is, is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve, yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem?
Now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book.
And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because, you see, one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book, it didn't know what it was, and it's going to present it to you.
Facebook: Every time you add a friend or poke somebody, you help to digitize a book.
But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word, bad things can happen.
Here's how it works.
Okay, so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA.
Let me tell you about one that I'm most excited about.
Why can't we use machine translation?
So I'll just let you read.
So we need people to translate the whole Web.
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free.
But then we realized, there's actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution.
So the way this works is whenever you're a just a beginner, we give you very, very simple sentences.
And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software.
The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation.
But the magical thing here is that they're paying with their time, but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language.
Each Zipcar replaces 15 personal cars, and each driver drives about 80 percent less because they're now paying the full cost, all at once, in real time.
But what's really happening is that we've got the power of a free and open Internet, and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation, and the peers are now in partnership with the company, creating shared value on shared values, and each strengthening the other, and doing what the other can't do.
The two of these are delivering the best of both worlds.
When I talked to their CEO, he had this great line.
Who would have thought that two young guys and a start-up would beat out Google Video? Why?
The cars are completely insured during the rental, and it gives drivers what they need, and what do they need?
No reply. Like, a huge proportion of them couldn't be bothered after they had just started, they just signed up, to reply.
What happens in Peer, Inc. companies is that you have tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions of people who are creating experiments on this model, and so out of all that influence and that effort, you are having this exceptional amount of innovation that is coming out.
Thank you.
Well, as with many other domains in life, I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question.
We've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before, over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people.
Maybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment.
So what did we find?
So I've been talking about this, suggesting, perhaps, that mind-wandering causes unhappiness, but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.
Turns out, they wander a lot. In fact, really a lot.
Now this was being broadcast live.
And I was thinking, how many terrorists could I possibly play before turning into one myself?
And it was as if through the standards of my Western life, I hadn't lived up to my full potential.
And he said, "I'm sorry, I can't tell you."
We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets.
And I realized it had to come from the people.
But instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide, Ghana honored democracy and its people.
Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa is not over, but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists, and that we must not take it for granted.
And when I went to find out something, I used scientific methods. I wasn't real surprised, you know, when they first told me how -- how you were supposed to do science, because I'd already been doing it for fun and whatever.
They didn't have TV screens, and they didn't have any football games to watch.
One thing, he put a bird in there, and he pumped all the air out, and the bird died. So he said, hmm ...
And a vacuum -- there's nothing in a vacuum, so you've -- God couldn't be in there.
It's two fans, one which he could turn from outside after he got the vacuum established, and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it, the one fan would no longer turn the other one, right?
It wasn't like a TED conference.
And seeing what happens, it was OK to generalize, and say, I'm sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things.
But the general idea that you could only -- you could only really talk about things in that place that had some kind of experimental basis.
And this is just 350 years.
I didn't take it personally, but -- I just -- I had -- I naively had thought, until this surfing experience started me into the 17th century, I'd thought that's just the way people thought, and everybody did, and they recognized reality by what they could see or touch or feel or hear.
And we didn't have -- like, my mother presided over the back yard from an upstairs window, where she would be ironing or something like that.
I'm sure it's got to do with rockets or it wouldn't be in that manual.
I mean, the little bowl of that stuff that had cooled down -- you'd light it, and it would just start dancing around the yard.
And we had not -- I mean, we weren't frightened by it.
But in the actual process, you get an idea -- like, when I got the idea one night that I could amplify DNA with two oligonucleotides, and I could make lots of copies of some little piece of DNA, you know, the thinking for that was about 20 minutes while I was driving my car, and then instead of going -- I went back and I did talk to people about it, but if I'd listened to what I heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists -- I would have abandoned it.
And no tricky shit behind the thing. I mean, it's all -- you've got to be very honest with what you're doing if it really is going to work.
But a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel.
And most responsible people that measure temperatures realize you have to shield your measuring device from that.
But in fact, it was just coming up -- it was the nighttime; the daytime temperatures didn't go up.
The whole business of the global warming -- trash, really, is that -- if the -- if there's too much CO2 in the atmosphere, the heat that's trying to escape won't be able to get out. But the heat coming from the sun, which is mostly down in the -- it's like 350 nanometers, which is where it's centered -- that goes right through CO2.
They're concerned, and you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers, because they're talking about big laboratories that are funded by lots of money and by scared people.
So I mean, the reason I put those things all together, OK, here's the way you're supposed to do science -- some science is done for other reasons, and just curiosity.
So here we have this incredible field, which has enormous hope for humanity, but much like IVF over 35 years ago, until the birth of a healthy baby, Louise, this field has been under siege politically and financially.
In 1998, human embryonic stem cells were first identified, and just nine years later, a group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell called an induced pluripotent stem cell, or what we refer to as an IPS cell.
We've got to look at the big picture.
The people for whom it was a lifesaver could have still taken their medicine.
So this is what we've built.
At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.
I also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them.
So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself.
When I got comfortable in the space, it also felt like a big playground.
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.
This particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, which was demolished in 1890 when Columbia moved in.
This was taken under a homeless asylum built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.
So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries, making them into the catacombs.
It was built in the early 1500s.
And this is the first theater project I worked on.
I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do.
And would you be able to, kind of, draw a -- you don't have to draw the diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram, if you had to do it? Or would you just say, that's actually not possible?
And I -- you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate, but maybe not in this instance.
And there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand what it is that's happening in photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation is how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation, as I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew, is how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
Oh, you're all shaking your heads, but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.
Between Australia and here, right, they've got summer and we've got winter, and what -- does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night, and then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on, and we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right, and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields.
That's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks, from websites, educational websites -- and almost anything you pick up is like that.
And things that -- where there isn't an extra barrier of a piece of glass or machined titanium, and it all looks fantastic, OK?
Poor teaching actually does more harm than good.
Ah ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right?
Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth.
Is biology special?
It's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden.
So as a chemist, I wanted to say, "Hang on. What is going on here?
We're awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards.
And the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing.
And so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating, metabolizing, burning through chemistries.
We somehow got to proteins and DNA.
The other thing we need to think about is the emergence of chemical complexity.
I need some information, and I need a container.
And we can aggregate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big nano-molecular molecules the same size of DNA and proteins, but there's no carbon in sight.
They're all made of the same stuff, but they want their shape to win.
Is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compete?
But not only just that, we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology.
So using evolution in biology, and in inorganic biology, for me is quite appealing, quite exciting.
Just a quick question on timeline.
Because the thing is, we are so chauvinistic to biology, if you take away carbon, there's other things that can happen.
I bring you to the webpage, ChildMortality.org, where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries -- it's done by U.N. specialists.
What we rely on is not an incomplete system.
And all these colored lines here are results; each color is one survey.
But in June, I got a mail in my inbox from Demographic Health Surveys, and it showed good news from Kenya.
They say, "0.9 percent, no progress."
And the reason here for Africa is especially important, because '90s was a bad decade, not only in Kenya, but across Africa.
We in public health, we hate child death, so we want less and less and less of child deaths.
Still here, child death per 1,000 on that axis.
It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing.
We had primary school actually started in 1842.
Egypt was up here in 1960, higher than Congo.
We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill.
They had high, or very high, child mortality and family size, six to eight.
India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box, and we get a lot a new neighbors.
It labels "developing countries," -- I can read from the list here -- developing countries: Republic of Korea -- South Korea.
The rest here is good -- the rest is good.
All the time we are trying to get value for money.
And if they do so, then, of course, the conditions improve, and they start riding on scooters.
And what you said, Lakshmi, is absolutely true: it's not just Ratan Tata, it's the house of Tatas over time.
They combine all that.
We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment."
I still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated.
There was a co-creation, a huge co-creation, with vendors and suppliers.
All the time, you have been given an envelope.
And that is where, ladies and gentlemen, this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important.
Unfortunately, that's not the case in India.
And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India.
"No ... not at all."
You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs.
Let us just take an example.
Cost of development -- 300 million dollars.
And that is how this difference has come.
You are not talking about affordability, you are talking about extreme affordability.
They're not available in Indian villages.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end before time.
LP: A quick question for you.
The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down.
What does that focal length do?
When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research -- 40 laboratories -- when two laboratories were not talking to each other, I would [unclear].
I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit, so I decided to make the app.
There's these programs called the iPad Pilot Program, and some districts have them.
I'd like to get into Android programming and development, and I'd like to continue my app club, and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others. Thank you.
In a nuclear power plant, you have a big pot of water that's under high pressure, and you have some fuel rods, and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium, and they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel, and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level, and that reaction heats up water, the water turns to steam, steam turns the turbine, and you produce electricity from it.
That's between, say at an average use, that's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that.
And we have a lot of it sitting around, because this is a big problem.
They operate anywhere from, you know, maybe 200 to 300 degrees Celsius.
So you have what's called the xenon pit, and so some of these fission products love neutrons.
Because your fuel is liquid, and it's combined with your coolant, you could actually just drain the core into what's called a sub-critical setting, basically a tank underneath the reactor that has some neutrons absorbers.
That's a ton of power.
And I think, I think, that looking at the technology, this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas, and you don't have to refuel it for 30 years, which is an advantage for the developing world.
Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy that lasted for millennia.
Long-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price; fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing; and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods, but services as well.
Think about drinking wine, about a journey to the Clock of the Long Now.
You like your fantasy environments, your fake, your Disneyland experiences.
Right? All of those are man-made, artificiality brought into the woods by you, and by the very nature of being there.
We're the agrarian economy, and we're supplying commodities.
Two, is other-directed: being what you say you are to others.
All right, now, there is value for fake.
But is it really true to itself?
When you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment.
Right, the T&amp;A network. Then it bought Miramax, known for its NC-17 fare, and all of a sudden, families everywhere couldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney.
Then you have that perception that you are phony.
Two or three cents per cup -- that's what coffee is worth.
Thank you.
And also, working with wire -- everything that I did was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time.
Since I'm always liking to solve problems, I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction, and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth.
You know, they say, never play with your food -- but I always play with things.
I had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair, and I saw it explode up and out.
Because it could run all the time.
So, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic.
After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers, I made that tool, and then I made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly -- sort of developing my own little world of technology.
And the idea, their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street, and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best.
So I'll just let this chair come down.
So perfectly organized a structure, it was hard not to attribute divinity to it.
25 Days: Heart chamber developing 32 Days: Arms &amp; hands are developing 36 Days: Beginning of the primitive vertabrae These weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus.
I'm going to show you something pretty unique.
Take a look at this little tuft of capillaries.
And it's not just our own existence, but how does the woman's body understand to have genetic structure that not only builds her own, but then has the understanding that allows her to become a walking immunological, cardiovascular system that basically is a mobile system that can actually nurture, treat this child with a kind of marvel that is beyond, again, our comprehension -- the magic that is existence, that is us?
Are we alone? SETI.
Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope of Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.
A hot gas is producing emission lines only, no continuum.
Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees.
We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature, which belongs to osmium.
And later a black hole was formed in a binary system, which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses.
And later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything strange with these objects.
And doing this for 14 billion years, we end up with this picture, which is a very important graph, showing relative abundances of chemical elements in sun-like stars and in the interstellar medium.
And this is going to be an instrument to detect Earth-like planets around sun-like stars.
How to measure, if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small, so those planets are tectonically dead, there cannot be life.
Now imagine doing this test for other planets.
They want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines, in the spectrum of a star, in different ways.
I think it will not come from UFOs.
Thank you very much.
And I was like, "Why not magic pixie?"
And she went, "Haha. There's no such thing."
That was my mantra.
It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice and mental health and abuse and neglect, what we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is -- neurobiologically that's how we're wired -- it's why we're here.
As you know, it's not going to turn out well.
And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging.
So I wrote at the top of the manila folder, and I started looking at the data.
And the last was they had connection, and -- this was the hard part -- as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that for connection.
And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting.
And they're like, "I'm just saying, you know.
And she said, "What's the struggle?"
"It just is what it is."
Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick, and we're newly married; initiating sex with my husband; initiating sex with my wife; being turned down; asking someone out; waiting for the doctor to call back; getting laid off; laying off people -- this is the world we live in.
And I know that's knowing laughter.
The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain.
You know how blame is described in the research?
My job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh grade."
We'll fix it."
after going to sleep at 12:45 a.m.
They were making detailed journals of their spending, their mood, their symptoms, their treatments.
Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler, but the top is a very small GPS transceiver, which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident, giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors.
Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research.
And you go from being a healthy, robust 29-year-old male to someone that cannot breathe, cannot move, cannot speak.
"Given my status, what is the best outcome I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?"
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time.
We need to give to others to be successful.
Here is an M.S. patient.
These are patients currently on drugs, sharing data.
And you can see here, as this animates over, Steven's actual data against the background of all other patients, against this information.
So, you click down on the ALS tab there.
Years after he's had these drugs, I learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva, including some positive side effects that came from other drugs, were making his constipation worse.
It's actually the most used feature on the website.
You don't want to be on the red line, you want to be on the blue line.
I want to know now. Can you help us?"
I bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over, and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine that came in Leopard. And we said -- because it's really cool, you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer, and find everything you've lost, and I loved it.
And he took lithium, and he went down the line.
Even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly. Exactly.
And there are these guys who used to model the future of interest rates, and all that kind of stuff.
It's the first version of the time machine.
I've got to thank the 45,000 people that are doing this social experiment with us.
A little bit further on in the article it said "a loss that would normally take the ice shelf 50-100 years to replace."
And I wondered, what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places, where the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms?
One of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material, carbon, that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor, and when the vaporized carbon condenses, it condenses back into a different form: chickenwire rolled up.
As we were working on this incredible discovery at University of Florida, we were told to go down the corridor to visit another scientist, and he was working on a pretty incredible thing.
In terms of dollars per what's stored, it's simply the best.
And for that I do not need an electric grid between us.
I'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists, no kinder than many of the people in the world, but they have a magic look at the world.
We should do better than this.
Now, you've probably all heard of similar criticism coming from people who are skeptical of capitalism.
Unfortunately, the answer is yes.
Despite the success, physics has its limits.
So this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system.
Now you may think that no one's looked at this before because ownership networks are really, really boring to study.
Scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data, because a foundational guideline in science is: Let the data speak. Okay. Let's do that.
And we already see signs of organization going on here.
This ended up giving him control in Telecom Italia with a leverage of 26.
So what did we find after computing all this network control?
It's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system, so it's probably not the result of a top-down approach like a global conspiracy.
I really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common ground to be found.
They're out there because they need to eat.
It was like the best of science fiction come true.
So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy.
So seven years ago, when honeybee colonies were reported to be dying en masse, first in the United States, it was clear that there was something really, really wrong.
We stopped planting cover crops.
Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies, hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination, and also because the pollen in an almond blossom is really high in protein. It's really good for bees.
One of these class of insecticides, the neonicontinoids, is making headlines around the world right now.
It's this big, blood-sucking parasite that compromises the bee's immune system and circulates viruses.
We need all of our bees.
On behalf of the bees, thank you.
We're kind of at a tipping point.
Today at the micro- and nanoscales, there's an unprecedented revolution happening.
So I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds, that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials and the built environment.
And those interactions allow for error correction, and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state.
And we built 500 of these glass beakers.
The idea was, could we self-assemble furniture-scale objects?
These are parts being printed with multi-material properties.
So this isn't expensive pumps or valves.
And on one side of the bunk bed, I had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry.
And if you have children, you've seen this hundreds of times before.
... with one broken leg.
I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error.
We're hoping for both because our business model is, if you come into a therapy session with one problem, we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10, so you keep coming back over and over again.
And very quickly, my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world.
I didn't expect to get in, and my family had no money for college.
I talked to a boarding school up in New England, probably the most prestigious boarding school, and they said, "We already know that.
And into the silence, I said, "I'd be happy to speak at your school, but just so you know, that's not a wellness week, that's a sickness week.
You got good grades, now you have to get better grades, you got into a good school and after you get into a better school, you got a good job, now you have to get a better job, you hit your sales target, we're going to change your sales target.
Doctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative, neutral or stressed.
Journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it.
Who has a computer? Yeah.
It's such a great way to -- I mean, they should make Java books like this, and we've have no problem learning a program.
But, anyway, that's where I grew up, in this little tofu factory in Seattle, and it was kind of like this: a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture.
And the problem when you're younger -- for all you students out there -- is, your head gets kind of big really easy.
And isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design?
And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time.
They were saying, Why's it moving?
And so in Japan, I began to experiment with people.
In the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing.
So, she wears the disk, and reads the data off the sectors of the disk, and the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really.
So, if you talk into the mike, you'll hear some music in your headphones; if you talk in the phone, then video would happen.
So, Naomi was pivotal in that.
And I began to wonder, Is this the goal?
So, I began to make things again. This is another series of objects made of old computers from my basement.
And so computers, as you know, these big computers, there are now tiny computers.
So anyways, there are all these things you can do, but the thing I love the most is to experience, taste the world.
We can't help but stop, right? This feeling's a wonderful thing.
I'm, like, how did this happen, kind of thing?
So, I'm going to RISD, actually.
This is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl.
For every 100 girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed, we have 324 boys.
Even in their older years, what we find is that there's still a problem.
So let's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and 13.
But when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it has to be suspended from school, I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance.
I don't want to write that stuff."
So that's the first reason: zero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out.
And I'm not very good at this, so I guess I'd better go play video games or get into sports, or something like that, because I obviously don't belong here.
That's what she tells them.
We need to put ourselves into boy culture.
We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies.
Most of the educational games do not.
They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything.
Well, at least, here at CERN.
But for the moment, since we have found no evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose that the particles that we know today, including the Higgs boson, are the only elementary particles in nature, even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far.
And some elementary particles interact with this substance, gaining energy in the process.
And the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state, is not just a few times more intense than today, but billions of times, and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state, all atomic matter would collapse.
The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse.
But the reason why I am interested in the transition of the Higgs field is because I want to address the question, why is the Higgs boson mass so special?
In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach, and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around 30, 35 degrees.
But I don't know if my hypothesis is right.
So what I did was, I filmed six of my friends and then, using video mapping and video projection, I created a video sculpture, which was these six friends projected into jars.
But something about the first piece, the Animali Chordata piece, kept coming back to me, this idea of interaction with art, and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact, and also being challenged by interacting with art.
But I'd never done anything about myself.
It's a two-seat, single-engine airplane that works just like any other small airplane.
And we were all very flattered to see that image become a symbol of accomplishing something that people had thought was impossible really the world over.
We have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car.
And that's the automated wing-folding mechanism.
That was beautiful from up here, I tell you.
Still, if everything goes to our satisfaction with the testing and construction of the two production prototypes that we're working on right now, those first deliveries to the, about a hundred, people who have reserved an airplane at this point should begin at the end of next year.
Doesn't matter if it rains a little, you have a windshield wiper.
I'm going to be talking about designing humor, which is sort of an interesting thing, but it goes to some of the discussions about constraints, and how in certain contexts, humor is right, and in other contexts it's wrong.
Indeed, it is discouraging.
"I don't like to see animals suffer -- even in cartoons."
But this is a worse one.
The average cartoonist who stays with the magazine does 10 or 15 ideas every week.
At a certain point, this rejection slip, in 1977 -- [We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it.] — magically changed to this.
Now that's not a cartoon. It requires thinking on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part to make it into a cartoon.
It's been reprinted thousands of times, totally ripped off.
In here, you have the propriety of The New Yorker and the vulgarity of the language.
For God's sake no, a thousand times no.
Office worker: Green bean salad?BM: No.
"I'm thinking about having a child."
It's rude. The world really shouldn't be that way.
One way to look at it is this.
He laughs. He is both in danger and safe, incredibly aroused. There's no joke. No joke needed.
Or there was another cartoon I didn't show because actually I thought maybe people would be offended.
"I figure if I don't have that third martini, then the terrorists win."
You have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference, and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon.
The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk.
Here, in the nonsense range: "Damn it, Hopkins, didn't you get yesterday's memo?"
This is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man, I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister that pays all the bills.
Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...
They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.
Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings, but doing a bit of historical research, it seems to be Fredrick the Great.
He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.
But the first thing is that all value is subjective.
Another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value, which remember, is what, after all, the environmental movement needs to be about: This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813.
If you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.
It involves limited raw materials.
Although it's called agriculture in the world of food.
Finally, we have contextual communication.
If you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home, and every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you, put 50 dollars into your pension, you would save a lot more.
Now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible, added value, without changing the product in the slightest.
[unclear] You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that it's more interesting looking.
But this is both hysterically funny -- but I think an important philosophical point, which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.
And a final thing: When you place a value on things like health, love, sex and other things, and learn to place a material value on what you've previously discounted for being merely intangible, a thing not seen, you realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.
I found my passion.
I felt my passion, heart and soul, had left my body.
Could you let me share my passion with you through my performance?
Darwin had this amazing idea.
It's all just the same thing happening.
You try them all in order: Mmm...?
We're so used to thinking in terms of biology, we think about genes this way.
And he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes, and so he said, "Is there another replicator out there on the planet?"
And abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good and made a good meme, an effective spreading meme.
Well, you sir, you've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way.
The way to think about memes, though, is to think, why do they spread?
Audience: Soap.
Some people get carried away.
Copying with variation and selection.
And so, from our perspective, we don't realize that that's how it began.
Because the processes are getting different.
So, we're at this cusp now of having a third replicator on our planet.
Human intelligence is only one kind of a thing.
Because it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out -- sending information, sending probes, getting out there, and communicating with anywhere else.
But then, a long time later, billions of years later, we got the second replicator, the memes.
Do you know, sitting here, your brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output for two percent of your body weight?
Now, are we going to pull through?
Where the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves.
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
These are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake, while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country.
AIDG has worked in Haiti since 2007, providing engineering and business support to small businesses.
There is nothing here that we don't know.
Chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades.
To make sure these buildings are safe, it's not going to take policy -- it's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques.
And now you know why I'm fun at parties.
You wouldn't think that skeletons and penises have very much to do with one another.
It's easy to bend.
And the interaction is crucial.
So I thought, wall tissue's important in skeletons.
It had the central fluid, it had the surrounding wall, and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices around the long axis of the skeleton.
Now my adviser's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton.
The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton.
We've got limits on our time.
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly -- you take a long time, but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach?
And, you know, there's not much -- there wasn't much I could do, and they kept on doing what they were doing.
I kept on doing this for a while.
And it turns out it's a more general case -- there's a lot of mistakes we do.
Other people I would tempt to cheat.
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught?
Some people shredded everything, went out of the room, and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.
And this is particularly interesting, because MIT doesn't have an honor code.
A third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it, they came to us and said, "Mr. Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X dollars."
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet, because in Enron, there's also a social element.
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student.
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing.
If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating, we feel it's more appropriate, as a group, to behave this way.
Would they not be able to see it this way?
We can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life, in our business life, and most particularly when it goes to policy, when we think about things like No Child Left Behind, when you create new stock markets, when you create other policies -- taxation, health care and so on.
But trust me, I work in advertising.
And the Bitcoins are released, they're put into a public ledger called the Blockchain, and then they float, so they become a currency, and completely decentralized, that's the sort of scary thing about this, which is why it's so popular.
And that's not surprising, if you think about the basket case that is the E.U.
And I find that sort of scary.
So you think about loyalty.
It could become a natural extension, that as well as buying stuff -- take it out of the Kindle -- you could buy books, music, real-life products, appliances and goods and so on.
They say, that is trust. I trust that. That's quality.
So Nike is literally acting as a well-being partner, a health and fitness partner and service provider.
So government, money, war, nothing changes there, then.
Thank you!
I was nominated for a Grammy and I've won some awards and stuff like that, so that's awesome, but the best part was meeting my husband, and I've actually known Donnell for probably 12 years now, and I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess, how music brought us together, but I'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October 5, Donnell Leahy.
We grew up playing— Mom's from Cape Breton, coincidentally.
Twelve years, er, 20 years later little did she think her kids would be getting married, but anyway, so, then I got a phone call about, I dunno, seven years later. I was 19, first or second year of college, and it was Donnell, and he said "Hi, you probably don't know me but my name is Donnell Leahy."
I starts out with a slow air.
DL: You start. NM: No, you have to start, because you've got to do your thing.
NM: Uh, sure.
I like it.
So, this is my grandfather, Salman Schocken, who was born into a poor and uneducated family with six children to feed, and when he was 14 years old, he was forced to drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table.
Such is the power of self-study.
So I'd like to share with you a story about a self-study, self-empowering computer science course that I built, together with my brilliant colleague Noam Nisan.
You can imagine the tremendous joy of playing with a Tetris game that you wrote in JACK and then compiled into machine language in a compiler that you wrote also, and then seeing the result running on a machine that you built starting with nothing more than a few thousand NAND gates.
And NAND2Tetris became one of the first massive, open, online courses, although seven years ago we had no idea that what we were doing is called MOOCs.
For example, take Dan Rounds, who is a music and math major from East Lansing, Michigan.
I'm sick of it.
So after some guided trial and error, the child will discover, with or without help, that he or she can duplicate the original figure and then take the result, transpose it, glue it to the original and then proceed [with] what we did before: cut, rearrange, paste — oops— paste and glue, and tile.
Now, I don't know how many people here are familiar with the term "mensch."
But I want to tell you what the Congo has got to do with you.
It is used in aerospace and medical equipment as alloys.
The Congo consistently scores dreadfully in global health and poverty rankings.
It has allowed momentous political change to take place.
At the moment, there is no clear fair trade solution, but there has been a huge amount of progress.
Sending and receiving letters took months, if you were lucky. Often they never arrived.
In reality, no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business, so you are going to muddle by, understaffed.
They've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings.
In an alternative view of this pool of local, very flexible people, here's a market research company, and it's inducted maybe 25 local people in how to do street interviewing.
She may have possessions that she would like to trade at times she doesn't need them.
It manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways.
And those facilities -- I'm talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity, the licensing authorities that know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time, the processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels.
Politicians in a big, complex, sophisticated I.T. project?
In terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses, this was an unqualified success.
This is now in the hands of the consortium.
And they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training if they wanted to go into that market.
Some rough research suggests this could unlock around 100 million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity in a country the size of the U.K.
He liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.
With every picture, there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told.
KB: Thanks for letting me show these.
Energy, at the moment, is dominated by resource.
But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world.
And indeed that's exactly what stars do.
For a moment they become helium 5, because they've got five particles inside them.
You have to make it from something else.
And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it, because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air.
Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion.
And in fact we can make fusion happen.
It gets very expensive to do this research.
And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is.
But it's the largest Arab country and it's also one with a great deal of influence.
And that's because they have better job opportunities and their state offers better social services.
Majorities as high as 90 percent and greater in Egypt, Indonesia and Iran told us in 2005 that if they were to write a new constitution for a theoretical new country that they would guarantee freedom of speech as a fundamental right, especially in Egypt.
The signs don't look good, some have said.
"They're really watching us, and we can't help but worry that we're not going to live up to their expectations."
Where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in 2010 -- I'm surprised it was a quarter -- 90 percent thought that this last election was honest.
They were doctors and dissidents, artists and organizers.
So the question becomes, What drives men's support for women's rights?
Texting has a 100 percent open rate.
We've been getting text messages back like these.
I will not forget the day we got that text message.
That's great.
In fact, the year after the NYPD put CompStat in place, the murder rate fell 60 percent.
You could see the immediate impact of legislation or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly and see what happens as a result.
If you want to know how, ask yourself this question: What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?
Clemenceau said, "Life gets interesting when we fail, because it's a sign that we've surpassed ourselves."
That's still true today.
The third stage has a camera.
We must fly again, because amazing, never-been-done-before things require that you fly.
It can hover and rotate.
Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot.
That's enough to stick six 42-inch plasma TV's to your wall, no nails.
Each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 degrees Fahrenheit -- hotter than the surface of the Sun.
It was made in tobacco plants.
They are nerds, and they are heroes among us.
You were born to.
Jason started at DARPA on March 18th, 2010.
Superhero, superhero. Superhero, superhero. Superhero, superhero. Superhero, superhero. Superhero, superhero. Voice: Because that's what being a superhero is all about.
No, there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed.
RD: Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be, right.
RD: So I mean, in part, we wondered if it was possible to do it.
I mean, do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here?
Thank you so much for coming to TED.
While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities, 99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector, and so therefore we're equally, if not more, accountable.
The question is, as a building professional, as an architect, an engineer, as a developer, if you know this is going on, as we go to the sights every single week, are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations?

This story began four years ago.
And so two months later, we found ourselves "at large" -- myself, 10 juvenile inmates and a wonderful fellow named Russ, who became a very good friend of mine and my partner in this project.
So he crashes down, and he gets slightly injured, but this does not prevent him from jumping up and then starting to jump up and down on his bike and curse violently.
Well, that's a problem because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving because it's getting dark soon and dangerous.
And he spent the last 10 years of his life in two places only, the slums and the state prison, where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there.
Together with the kids, I also went through a remarkable transformation.
You know, perspective is one of these critically important life-coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you.
And yet, two hours later you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery, smeared with mud, blood and sweat.
This was the first place where we got some water and supplies."
And through this tapestry, which is the history of this country, the kids acquire what is probably the most important value in education, and that is the understanding that life is complex, and there's no black and white.
And the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me, and it's given me an insight into the whole notion of self, which I think is worth sharing with you today.
Is it who we really are?
Without it, we literally can't interface with others.
I'd literally lose myself.
I applied to read anthropology at university.
Right?
We've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self.
In those moments, I'm connected to everything -- the ground, the air, the sounds, the energy from the audience.
And when I realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function, a funny thing happened.
Because, hey, if we're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life, then we're devaluing and desensitizing life.
The first building I built was 20 years ago.
And this is pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to St. Paul's Cathedral in London.
And so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work.
And as he was diving, someone had stamped on his knee, and it had broken like this.
In the news, the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time.
It was voted the worst place in Britain to live.
The finished project is meant to be more than just a power station.
So there are up to a million people there everyday.
So the challenge was, how are we going to bring light and expose these things?
And inside, the daylight -- each one is an optic and it brings light into the center.
There's just silence and a cool temperature.
This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment, who was our client, with the Chinese children, using the landscape.
It's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience, and the rest of it is just for postcards.
Thank you.
Thank you, Thomas.
One of them, from anthropology, is the study of human universals.
Now, given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question, why should it have been such an appealing notion?
Also, even if we were born with certain ignoble motives, they don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior.
Well, the book came out in October, and nothing terrible has happened.
I'll just put that list up for a few seconds, and see if you can guess which two -- I would estimate that probably two of these topics inspired probably 90 percent of the reaction in the various reviews and radio interviews.
And I have a collection, probably 10 or 15 headlines, from highbrow magazines deploring the fact that the arts are in decline in our time.
The only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres.
But it's very clear, looking at these syllabuses, that -- it's used now as a way of saying that all forms of appreciation of art that were in place for centuries, or millennia, in the 20th century were discarded.
Well, you get the idea.
The genetically controlled studies have some sobering results.
So let me conclude with just a remark to bring it back to the theme of choices.
My role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple.
This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday, but it had a certain familiarity to it.
And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built, and we go about the business of animal husbandry.
And I'm like that's not rubber at all, you know.
I say, "Time out. Stop."
And he said "Well, that's how we do it."
And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was, in that second.
I do.
And I can't get this thought out of my head, and I can't get that vision out of my sight, so I did what I had to do.
It's what our network does; it's what "Dirty Jobs" is.
You know?
Look, I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not, but do you realize you've shot in every state?
I do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong, some of the other notions of work that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct, and they're not.
Follow your passion -- what could possibly be wrong with that?
Safety -- safety first?
So, I'm 40 feet off the deck, which is like looking down at the top of your shoe, you know, and it's doing this in the ocean.
You want to get home alive, that's on you.
We didn't set out to do it and we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way, but we've done it.
I mean, so many of the commercials that come out there -- in the way of a message, what's really being said?
And nobody celebrates imitation the way "Dirty Jobs" guys know it has to be done.
So, we're thinking -- by we, I mean me -- that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work, manual labor, skilled labor.
So, if I were running for anything, and I'm not, I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.
Which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists.
It used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
And we got to Broadmoor.
And he wasn't overweight, he was in very good physical shape.
Nurses will bring you pizzas.
They sent him to Broadmoor.
But how do you sit in a sane way?
Anyway he seemed completely normal to me -- but what did I know?
Fifteen of you are psychopaths.
You want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths."
So I went to Al Dunlap's grand Florida mansion that was filled with sculptures of predatory animals.
He'd close down 30 percent of the workforce.
Can I go through them with you?"
But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap.
And I realized, oh my God. This is what I've been doing for 20 years.
I said, "Well they say that you're a psychopath."
He was living with a girl outside London.
And Tony said to me, "Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar?
Let me say parenthetically why I think that's the case, because I think it's a potentially controversial statement.
Now, how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus?
You can show a slogan, or a symbol, or a sign that stands for democracy.
You know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of George W. Bush saying, "Islam means peace."
Now, if Islam and democracy are at present in a moment of great confrontation, what does that mean?
Well, all over the Muslim world there are people who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam, for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values, or just a source of powerful personal identity, who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible.
Because they would have done extraordinarily well.
It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room, or Muslims out in the rest of the world -- I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are -- conceptualize Islam.
Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens, it cannot be the right strategy, either pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war, "Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out, because we opposed the war in the first place."
And at this age, my personal idol was Flipper the dolphin.
And these are two of the penguins' main breeding islands.
We have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing, but completely inexperienced, volunteers.
So it was very clear these were stressed, sick, traumatized birds.
So would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins?
And we used this technique again during the Treasure rescue.
But part way through, they ran out.
And in addition, about 3,000 penguin chicks were rescued and hand-raised.
And when we come together and work as one, we can achieve extraordinary things.
Thank you.
It's called vegetable tourism, and believe it or not, people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds, even when there's not much growing.
We did not consult. We did not write a report.
So, back to the public meeting.
So we invented, without asking, of course, the Incredible Edible Green Route.
And then there's the third plate, because if you walk through an edible landscape, and if you're learning new skills, and if you start to get interested in what's growing seasonally, you might just want to spend more of your own money in support of local producers, not just veg, but meat and cheese and beer and whatever else it might be.
It's a stylized map of Togmorden.
Across age, across income, across culture.
Suddenly, we're seeing actions on the ground from local government. We're seeing this mainstreamed.
Through an organic process, through an increasing recognition of the power of small actions, we are starting, at last, to believe in ourselves again, and to believe in our capacity, each and every one of us, to build a different and a kinder future, and in my book, that's incredible.
But then I suffered a series of career catastrophes, one after the other, and finally found myself in television.
And I found some astonishing things in the course of my study that had never occurred to me. Frankly, in the days when I thought I'd had it with religion, I just found the whole thing absolutely incredible.
That, he said, was the central thread which ran through all his teaching and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day.
Saint Augustine made exactly the same point.
Now, I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who, when I say to them what I do for a living, inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history. Wrong.
Now -- but that's not the whole story.
We should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves.
You know the story of "The Iliad," the 10-year war between Greece and Troy.
It's of great importance that the word for "holy" in Hebrew, applied to God, is "Kadosh": separate, other.
I was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations, which was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism, and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism.
So if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium, and it engulfs it and eats it.
So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower, what would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?
I want to talk about something really ordinary, just ordinary sand.
And the reason that is, is because in a place like this island, a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow, and when they die, their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand, things like coral and so forth.
There's some sand that's really much more colorful.
And they're quite amazing-looking, and these are the tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in -- the planets and the Moon.
And you can see here that that is -- that's sort of vaporized, and that material is holding this little clump of little sand grains together.
I think that this was best put by William Blake when he said, "To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower, hold infinity in the palm of your hand, and eternity in an hour."
Now astrology -- we remove the banal idea that your life could be predicted; that you'll, perhaps today, meet a lucky man who's wearing a hat.
If you ever think that your life is rubbish, always remember there's another you that's made much worse decisions than that.
But every single thing that makes us, every atom in us, has already created a myriad of different things and will go on to create a myriad of new things.
And I can with all honesty look her in the eye and say, "Because our pheromones matched our olfactory receptors."
And that is all of these different things -- the love for my child.
Though I should say that my son is best and is better than your children.
I stopped observing the house for a moment, and when I started observing again, everything had happened."
If you go to the safari parks on Saturn or Jupiter, you will be disappointed.
Just flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk.
I'm a convict; I am branded 'wrong.' What are you going to tell me about right and wrong?"
Maybe it's you, maybe it's me -- but we're not here to trade opinions; everyone's got an opinion.
It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it -- what Socrates called "the examined life."
Let us think about that."
I was born in Calcutta -- a family where my father and his father before him were journalists, and they wrote magazines in the English language.
And two of the things about Bengal: they like their savory dishes and they like their sweets.
Energy came to it in some form or shape, data came to it in some form or shape.
One group of people said you can distill your information, you can extract value, separate it and serve it up, while another group turned around and said no, no you can ferment it.
And by this time I was hooked.
And we have to start thinking about how we create diets within ourselves, exercise within ourselves, to have the faculties to be able to deal with information, to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly.
Until his death in 2006, he was the all-powerful leader of Turkmenistan, a Central Asian country rich in natural gas.
I've been up to its front gates.
My first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African ivory.
But it wasn't about blood diamonds.
And he didn't do all of this in his own name either.
Well, we've all heard about what they are, I think, and we all know they're used quite a bit by people and companies who are trying to avoid paying their proper dues to society, also known as taxes.
Now, the Africa Progress Panel, led by Kofi Annan, they've calculated that Congo may have lost more than 1.3 billion dollars from these deals.
Now that's a hell of a lot of schools and universities and hospitals and business startups, many of which haven't materialized and never will because some of that money has simply been stolen away.
I mean, these are state assets.
But literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transparency, and now it's fast becoming the norm and the law.
I'm very worried today about this notion, this world, this prevailing kind of force of security.
This is, of course, unless your whole life is about being secure.
You become part of an "us."
In six years, I've had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day, a global movement against [violence against] women, to travel probably to 60 countries, and spend a great deal of time in different portions.
They have grieved it, they have died into it, and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine.
That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line, and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt, and were willing to be attacked and criticized.
There's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota.
That mutilation of her clitoris had actually obviously impacted her life and changed it in a way that was devastating.
Three years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation.
Real security is not only being able to tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them and only trusting a situation when they are present.
In the shared future, it will be just that, shared.
It's the sensible shoe of public address.
But upon arrival there, in the fall of 1986, and doing a lot of interviews, I found that the only thing I was offered was to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf, a book publisher.
They all need a face.
Now the Hepburn book was written in a very conversational style, it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you.
So, I went to the Museum of Natural History, and I checked out the bones, and I went to the gift shop, and I bought a book.
That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine.
But if you think about it, from my head to my hands to his leg.
And David especially loved this design because at book signings, which he does a lot of, he could take a magic marker and do this.
This particular story by Osama Tezuka is his epic life of the Buddha, and it's eight volumes in all. But the best thing is when it's on your shelf, you get a shelf life of the Buddha, moving from one age to the next.
He will not be pleased.
Then he'd run his hand over the rag paper, and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages.
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum.
So even though we love publishing as an art, we very much know it's a business too, and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky, that great art can be great business.
Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.
Like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were a free kind of utopia.
Now, our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insider's knowledge.
I wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop, and I wanted to get published.
The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult, but rather better adults than you have been, which may be a little challenging considering your guys' credentials .
Are you ready to make the match?
The first is the geophony, or the nonbiological sounds that occur in any given habitat, like wind in the trees, water in a stream, waves at the ocean shore, movement of the Earth.
Fortunately, more and more institutions are implementing the more holistic models that I and a few of my colleagues have introduced to the field of soundscape ecology.
With permission granted to record both before and after the operation, I set up my gear and captured a large number of dawn choruses to very strict protocol and calibrated recordings, because I wanted a really good baseline.
Well, I've returned to Lincoln Meadow 15 times in the last 25 years, and I can tell you that the biophony, the density and diversity of that biophony, has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation.
At the end of its breeding cycle, the Great Basin Spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard-panned desert soil of the American West, where it can stay for many seasons until conditions are just right for it to emerge again.
You've heard the impact of resource extraction, human noise and habitat destruction.
I couldn't pick a career.
And I was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day, and I flipped over right in front of the entire school.
So after the Sinclair ZX80 came along the very cleverly named Sinclair ZX81.
You had to have an even better imagination to play this game, "Death Rider."
He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe.
It grows every year.
So 37 is our target audience.
So as far as popularity of games, what do you think these people are doing here?
Now, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving.
Think about that's where we are right now, and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue to get better.
So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are.
When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo, whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me.
A generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world.
Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time TV.
No buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game.
I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are, but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.
I know that I am losing my grip.
Who is that going to come from?
You're off, you're off. That's it.
And as I've shown here, we have the audience.
Thank you.
And our friend, Betty Edwards, the "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" lady, shows these two tables to her drawing class and says, "The problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can't move your hand, but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty.
So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are, then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here. It's a waking dream, and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history.
So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what's important about the data.
and bingo. That is all you have to do.
Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious, which I thought for a long time, until she explained to me was to slow them down so they'll think.
And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first-order discrete differential equation and a second-order discrete differential equation, derived by six-year-olds.
And I can try steering the car here by ...
And it's interesting.
Teacher: [Choose] objects that you think will fall to the Earth at the same time.
Teacher: Drop. Class: Whoa!
Yeah, there we go. Yeah, OK?
The future of life, where the unraveling of our biology -- and bring up the lights a little bit. I don't have any slides.
It's because we're flesh and blood.
We're all going to eventually, even in the developed world, going to have to lose everything that we love.
And we've all seen "2001: A Space Odyssey."
What's happening is we're taking this technology -- it's becoming more precise, more potent -- and we're turning it back upon ourselves.
It's changing our lives in so many ways, and it will continue to do that.
But who is going to pay for all this?
That's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves.
Probably not.
It didn't happen.
And in that process that's going to morph from being just for diseases, to being for lesser vulnerabilities, like risk of manic depression or something, to picking personalities, temperaments, traits, these sorts of things.
And it won't be done.
The lines are going to blur. And they already are between therapy and enhancement, between treatment and prevention, between need and desire.
But we shouldn't kid ourselves and think that we're going to reach a consensus about these things.
There are too many people that think that high-technology medicine is going to keep them, save them, from overeating, from eating a lot of fast foods, from not getting any exercise.
And then what comes out of it? New life.
I think that we should be proud of it.
"The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, both glory and danger alike.
And I said, "Yeah."
And I said, "Well, funny you should ask.
And I said, "I know.
And I said, "Yes."
That's exactly how it happens."
She goes, "What about dogs?"
I know all about boilers and incinerators and fabric filters and cyclones and things like that, but I also have Marfan syndrome.
I can do this. I can change this.
Well this is a sagittal slice through me.
So it's quite a difficult structure to produce.
Four and a half hours on the table and everything was done.
I don't take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that I would choose to take.
And as you can see, there are not only two principal technical disciplines there, medicine and engineering, but also there are various specialists from within those two disciplines.
Institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project.
In the U.K. we have the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, NICE.
But most R and D is going to be institutionally funded, by the Polish Academy of Sciences or the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council or whatever, and you need to get past those people.
We've actually got 30 patients.
You've got to express support for them.
You can shortcut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have.
It's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos, and it's probably our oldest scourge.
So malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve, and yet to this day, hundreds of thousands of people are going to die from the bite of a mosquito.
Just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, the malaria parasite transforms itself like that seven times in its life cycle.
Or say your cow does, or say your pig does, and then, say, it rains, and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water.
You're less likely to have electricity and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible, so you're outside more.
What it means is, if you have malaria in your society, your economic growth is depressed by 1.3 percent every year, year after year after year, just this one disease alone.
When I told my relatives in India that I was writing a book about malaria, they kind of looked at me like I told them I was writing a book about warts or something.
And so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria, because if people think it's normal to have malaria, then how do you get them to run to the doctor to get diagnosed, to pick up their prescription, to get it filled, to take the drugs, to put on the repellents, to tuck in the bed nets?
The first concerted attack against malaria started in the 1950s.
The whole campaign crashed, malaria resurged back, but now it was even worse than before because it was corralled into the hardest-to-reach places in the most difficult-to-control forms.
But that's not how people with malaria think of malaria.
So it's probably an overestimate.
We end up imposing our own priorities on the people of the malarious world.
Thank you so much.
I know it's a cliche, but look, look how small, how tiny it has gotten.
And the Internet has reached every corner of the world, the poorest, the remotest places.
You know, these last two cartoons -- I did them live during a conference in Hanoi.
And it has changed the way your future employer will look at your application.
They wanted to stir up controversy.
Now, talk of a divided place -- the country was cut in two.
You'll hear more and more about it.
I went to see a Dozo chief; he told me about his magical powers.
We took them away from their newspaper for three days.
But they came up with a book, looking back at 13 years of political crisis in Ivory Coast.
And we did video clips -- you can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons.
And for dictators all over the world, the good news is when cartoonists, journalists and activists shut up.
And Jill Tarter was there, and she turned to me, and she looked at me just like that girl in "The Exorcist."
Our planet is a good planet because it can keep water.
The Sun increases in its intensity, in its brightness, and finally, at about 12 billion years after it first started, the Earth is consumed by a large Sun, and this is what's left.
In that complex record of fossils, there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly, and the father/mother geologists called these "mass extinctions."
A 10-kilometer body hit the planet.
This is a Buckminsterfullerene, a carbon-60.
You know, you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors.
There was big stuff back then.
They hate we animals.
You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places -- some lakes -- and get down, and you'll find that the water itself turns purple.
Well, what's the source of this?
But the second thing that's not shown on here: the Earth has never had any ice on it when we've had 1,000 parts per million CO2.
And I throw this slide in -- this is me, actually, two months ago -- and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal, chambered nautilus.
Five years from now, this is what I hope happens to me: I'm taken back to the boat, I'm given a gas mask: 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide.
So, he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours, sometimes six hours, and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here.
And so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen.
So, what we're looking at now: does it leave a signal?
We buy it for our kids.
And all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in Manila.
But right now, most of the companies involved in these supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future, nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product.
But take the example of heparin.
The problem was that it killed more people.
We don't have a system to ensure that human rights, basic dignity, are ensured.
They have parochial interests.
Those factories will probably never see an inspector.
Now, getting there is not easy.
I know there's going to be disbelief.
Go to the website. Look at the audit results.
The private actors, companies and NGOs, are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face.
"You want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain.
The numbers just make you want to zone out.
That's my simple proposition to you, my simple plea to every decision-maker in this room, everybody out there.
I want her to look at the world through the underside of a glass-bottom boat, to look through a microscope at the galaxies that exist on the pinpoint of a human mind, because that's the way my mom taught me.
It can crumble so easily, but don't be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.
All right, so I want you to take a moment, and I want you to think of three things that you know to be true.
Because he was out standing in his field.
And I was underdeveloped and over-excitable.
I was hooked.
Step two was the moment I said, "I will. I will continue.
as a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me.
Number three on Charlotte's list was, "I should have learned not to crush on guys three times my age."
But I try to walk through life like this.
And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie will connect with what you've shared.
But you don't get to start on step three, until you take step one first: I can.
I think that we all did.
My knees still buckle every time I get on a stage.
There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima that was completely burnt black by the radiation.
So if you tell me I can do the impossible, I'll probably laugh at you.
It puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact.
There's also a time to give.
In Guatemala, the central government -- controlled by a oligarchy of European decent -- was waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion, and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America: conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword.
A bedroom, the place where people share intimacy, where life itself is conceived, became a battlefield.
After several weeks, they washed off the white and took on the full responsibilities of men.
In southern Sudan, another civil war saw similar use of starvation as a means of genocide.
This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp.
Between 1995 and '96, I covered the first two wars in Chechnya from inside Grozny.
The rural poor had become the urban poor, and in the process, they'd become invisible.
This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia.
A prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun.
A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine.
Last year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops, from the battlefield in Iraq all the way home.
Photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people what's going on.
The fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us, to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all.
They trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly.
So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us, and then we'll use the paper for verification.
If the government wants to find out how you voted, they won't be able to.
Thank you.
To what extent are these people right?
You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this.
Islam is the majority religion all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East, Southern Europe and through Asia all the way to Indonesia.
The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies.
Now let's see what has happened in the world.
Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa.
That's where we have the fast population growth.
You need to get out of the deepest poverty so children are not of importance for work in the family.
I went to the statistical authority of Qatar, to their webpage -- It's a very good webpage. I recommend it -- and I looked up -- oh yeah, you can have lots of fun here -- and provided free of charge, I found Qatar's social trends.
And that's where family planning, better child survival is needed.
Well I will show you here.
We are here on top.
And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children.
I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived on the island for several weeks.
And then, like everyone else in our generation, we went to live in a Himalayan monastery.
Larry Brilliant: Smallpox was the worst disease in history.
Day one, day two, day three, day four, day five, day six.
This is confluent smallpox, in which there isn't a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by lesions.
And India was the place where smallpox made its last stand.
In India alone, my 150,000 best friends and I went door to door with that same picture to every single house in India. We made over one billion house calls.
It was the largest campaign in United Nations history until the Iraq war.
And we conducted the first Nepal survey ever done for health, and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done, and we had astonishing results.
WHO stages the progress of a pandemic.
But much worse than that, 90 percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime.
Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world.
And that simulation that I showed you that you thought was bird flu -- that was SARS. And SARS is the pandemic that did not occur.
It is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases is to find them early and to kill them before they spread.
Let's make it transparent, non-governmental, not owned by any single country or company, housed in a neutral country, with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent, and let's build it on GPHIN. Let's start with GPHIN.
No. I love it.
These bad viruses really don't have any intention of showing up first in English or Spanish or French.
This is the number of people joining the global middle class by 2030, coming out of poverty.
Now there are 500 cities, nearly, with a million people or more in them.
I'm going to refer to some of those as well, and I'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we've got.
And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.
They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.
We decided, over the next two years, we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.
It's a brilliant textile in use.
And we've decided in the next three years, we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business.
By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business.
And this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.
So what we decided to do was, we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us, what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children?
So the message here is, measure what you care about and lead the change, and don't wait a hundred years.
On having really good sustainability strategies, there are companies like Nike, Patagonia, Timberland, Marks &amp; Spencer.
There was this equation in my family that went something like this: if you are intelligent, you therefore are not spiritual.
So what did he mean by this? I'll show you.
Listen to these titles of some of the bestselling books from both sides of the political divide here in the U.S.
And I realize we're all busy people, so don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break.
She's an activist from the Right, and I'm an activist from the Left.
And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side?
By the end of our lunch, we acknowledged each other's openness.
It's two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls.
I traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia.
Photography transcended culture, including my own.
Senegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here, was once a child soldier, under the General's command, until he disobeyed orders, and the General shot off both his legs.
The second story I'm going to tell you about is about a group of very special fighting women with rather unique peace-keeping skills.
Many of the women are married with children, and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children.
And all this against incredible logistical odds, like heat and traffic jams.
Where does such rage come from?
Over the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested.
It's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby, has, in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world's media combined.
So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate, but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is?
And so it came in from the outside.
You're clear. All right. Firing.
Two-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile.
And releasing this caused widespread outrage.
I mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy.
And there's a lot of information.
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying.
Light is good.
And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document?
I mean, like any sort of growing startup organization, we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth, and that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don't have enough people to actually process and vet this information.
And you were also -- I mean, you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on.
J I'm not sure about the incident.
J Yeah, this is a great case, you know.
Wow.
The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this.
Every colored bead, every colored string, represents a weather element.
Every single color, dot, every single line, is a weather element.
And I really like that, because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music.
A carcinogen is any substance or agent that causes abnormal growth of cells, which can also cause them to metastasize or spread.
So I was very surprised about this.
However, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab -- so I could finally start my project.
And I found that if you increase the time cooked, the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases.
And I want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant.
Chemotherapy, one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today, involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells.
And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase, an energy protein.
So that was my work, and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research, with figuring out exactly what this protein does, but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness -- so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren.
1.6 million deaths worldwide.
And it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health, because that relationship seems so important.
And all of Julie's data has been pre-entered into my interactive software model.
So what it shows -- if you want to focus on that top graph in the right-hand corner -- it shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar.
So I'm very passionate about this research and I really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma, more respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants.
That's why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.
And the whole room, including me, was like, "Yeah."
So at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs.
I thought, "Well, that's amazing, because I don't feel disabled."
Nobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots.
Heavy!
And I had these legs made a little over a year ago at Dorset Orthopedic in England and when I brought them home to Manhattan, my first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.
And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was "green onion for free."
My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20, 30 years.
I thought I kind of offended them.
And sometimes I have young people approaching me say, "Lan, you changed my life," and I feel proud of that.
She showed off her expensive bags, clothes and car on her microblog, which is the Chinese version of Twitter.
And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog.
First of all, most of them were born in the 80s and 90s, under the one-child policy.
College graduates are not in short supply.
And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility.
Similarly, many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet.
But you know what, half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars.
And after hours of negotiation, 500 dogs were rescued.
And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves.
Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step.
There is nothing to eat up here, but the conditions were ideal for hibernation.
To really get the money shots, it's down to being in the right place at the right time.
If human, he'd have a nine-foot tongue.
It's freezing cold, and that thin air really gets you.
Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby.
"These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development of music in this country.
And in its place, we'd have the opposite of read-write culture, what we could call read-only culture.
Well, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question.
They had an exclusive license on the most popular content, and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate to the broadcasters who really was in charge.
In my view, the most significant thing to recognize about what this Internet is doing is its opportunity to revive the read-write culture that Sousa romanticized.
No one else will do ...
It is now anybody with access to a $1,500 computer who can take sounds and images from the culture around us and use it to say things differently.
Instead, what we've seen is something much worse than a revolt.
Because, as BMI demonstrated, competition here can achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now.
We have to recognize they're different from us. This is us, right?
They live life knowing they live it against the law.
And this is what this adventure's really about.
So, the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cells is really a history of where you've been for the past billion years.
So, this little thingamajig has a genome that's 200 times the size of yours.
We should have known that this existed because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye.
And the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sulfuric acid in batteries, and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core.
We are now experimenting with bongos, pandas, elims, Sumatran tigers, and the Australians -- bless their hearts -- are playing with these things.
These are companies that didn't exist five years ago.
Because if you happen to find this one inside your body, you're in big trouble, because that's the source code for Ebola.
In the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know, you can change the source code, and you can reprogram life forms so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine, or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials, which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester that feels like silk in corn.
And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings, and what the program is for those cells to differentiate, one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer, and one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas.
That's why sometimes a person's genes don't have to change a lot to get cancer.
Don't have an HER-2 receptor? Don't take Receptin.
This is going to push computers to have to grow faster than they've been growing, because so far, there haven't been applications that have been required that need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does.
And you can watch states rise and fall depending on their ability to speak a language of life, and you can watch New York fall off a cliff, and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff, and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence.
Because in agriculture, if you had 10 kids and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder, you could produce about five times more wealth, on average, than your neighbor.
Tiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources.
India and China used to be 40 percent of the global economy just at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent.
In the 1990s, these are sovereign states that did not exist before 1990.
And then he went and knocked an old lady house.
What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research says about why we're all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building.
No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception.
"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no."
Or in the case of double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security, they can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths of those that defend us.
And we all kind of hate to admit it.
But if you look more closely, the plot actually thickens.
We're deeply ambivalent about the truth.
Two-year-olds bluff.
The rest of us, we're only 54 percent accurate.
I never told anybody to lie, not a single time, never.
Now if he had repeated the question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail -- and we're all really glad he didn't do that -- he would have further discredited himself.
Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit.
They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox.
They're going to be willing to brainstorm, name suspects, provide details.
We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures.
It's still somewhat of a healthy relationship.
They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them.
Look, listen, probe, ask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode, ask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person you're talking to with rapport.
What you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes and her very, very cool demeanor.
And I don't understand it, and I never will.
It's transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public.

I've been in the audience.
In other words, it's the agents of our imagination who really shape who we are. And this is important to remember, because in Africa the complicated questions we want to ask about what all of this means has been asked from the rock paintings of the San people, through the Sundiata epics of Mali, to modern contemporary literature.
It's important because misreading is really the chance for complication and opportunity.
Language is not -- I mean, things don't have any mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value.
So, what it says to me then is that it's not really -- the problem isn't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told, the problem really is the terms of humanity that we're willing to bring to complicate every story, and that's really what it's all about.
But Harry's wife is confused, because she said, "You know, Harry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years."
So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history, and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz, I learned the melancholic history of my people through the melancholic history of another people.
But also, the book was launched in time for me to be accused of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt.
In fact, we were talking last night about how all of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa than any sex education programs ever had.
African narratives in the West, they proliferate.
I justified it, and I said, "This is the cost of revolution.
As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth, that I had challenged my students in America -- I said, "You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots."
"Here is love, all of it."
And now I'm tightening lashes, shaped in hide as if around a ribcage, shaped like five bowstrings.
Now I have beaten a song back into you.
Anyway, I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design, at least from my small aperture of the world.
Then this is a McNugget maker, I think.
It does pretty good.
Then I started doing animatronics.
My career basically peaked here.
You can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom.
And I started working on this project -- oh, I have to tell you about this real quick.
So, this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale.
This one actually didn't go anywhere, but I got my feet wet doing this.
And then Microsoft can just fill a, you know, a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell.
And then I've got to start building it, so this is the real thing.
So right now, you see, I love little robots.
At that time, Beanie Babies was a big hit, and we thought, we'll do a bunch of different ones.
So, a little tether coming off, it's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes.
We certainly didn't have the money to do this.
So this is how they come out close to the end.
And it's, of course, for your kids.
And we're going to try to really pull this off, intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive.
And then, these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here.
And then, of course, you're not done yet.
And then, four years and 10 million dollars later, we have a little Pleo.
Pleo, wake up. Pleo, come on.
You, yeah, yeah. Okay, he's hungry.
And we have a -- I have a little something here.
Kids can just drag and drop, put in new sounds.

Coke's success is relevant, because if we can analyze it, learn from it, then we can save lives.
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."
Real-time data turns on the lights.
In Tanzania and Uganda, they represent 90 percent of Coke's sales.
In just five years, their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people.
The third component of Coke's success is marketing.
And in South Africa, they associate happiness with seriti or community respect.
I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.
I'm not kidding.
And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation, I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?"
Let's look at a country like India.
Luckily, the genetic testing proved that, in fact, this strand came north, because, had it come from the south, it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.
It's not telling the parents, "If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated."
So if Coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness, I'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms.
If Joe jumped in a coral reef, there are many things the alien could see.
So let's start with the first one: Christmas Island, over 5,000 people.
Then the plankton feeders, these little damselfish, the little animals floating in the water.
Not only do these places -- these ancient, pristine places -- have lots of fish, but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams; pavements of giant clams in the lagoons, up to 20, 25 per square meter.
And the fish have grazed the algae, so the turf of algae is a little lower.
And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean.
So let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do.
If you don't kill the fish, they take a longer time to die, they grow larger and they reproduce a lot.
So there is spill over; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them, while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat. It is building resilience.
Another example: Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef.
Well, there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying; the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing.
But what about the rest of the coast of the world, where people live and make a living out of fishing?
Second, we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized, so conservation efforts don't depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities, like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places.
That was a masterful job of pulling things together.
They are like capacitors of the system.
You're saying we're spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies.
Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back.
And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.
This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.
Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this.
You can actually see through his head.
This is basically scientific data that you're looking at.
We're coming around a cliff here on the right.
We see it either as sound, or we see it as video, or we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors, but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.
This is one of these hydrothermal vents.
All the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the Earth -- so, chemosynthesis.
Here they go.
What they're getting at is that -- on the back of this crab -- the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals.
Here's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar.
We're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific.
I think this is the neatest-looking thing.
DG: It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well.
You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity, again, higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life.
El Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster, it's rhythmic.
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.
Students lack perseverance.
And I'll put it to all of you, what you already know, that no problem worth solving is that simple.
And the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students because, watch this, this is the practice problem set.
You have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about: which section is the steepest.
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean, we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down, specifically what that means.
And here's how it works.
So now we have a water tank.
But those conversations have been so valuable, among the most valuable.
I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited saying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that.
It's a great pleasure to speak after Brian Cox from CERN.
So the vantage point you take determines virtually everything that you will see.
So I ended up in places like this.
This is a guy called Juanderson.
What turned Juanderson around was technology for learning that made learning fun and accessible.
They're private schools. There are no state schools in slums.
This is a fee-pay school. This is a good school.
And education, plus technology, is a great source of hope.
If you want to attract people like Juanderson who could, for instance, buy guns, wear jewelry, ride motorbikes and get girls through the drugs trade, and you want to attract him into education, having a compulsory curriculum doesn't really make sense.
That's too long if you're poor.
These things, they teach through.
But you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people through technology, people and places that are different.
And he was finally brought back into school, not by the offer of GCSEs, but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter, a practical making skill.
And it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools.
And that's desperately what we need again on a global scale.
Almost all our effort goes in this box, sustaining innovation in formal settings, getting a better version of the essentially Bismarckian school system that developed in the 19th century.
Of 14 of them, only two of them are in schools.
You can go to places an hour away, less, from this room, just down the road, which need that, which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined.
But it will also lay waste to imagination.
He was in a movie called "Torch Song Trilogy."
There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect, and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life."
And I want to begin sharing these evil things that I've been doing with you, starting with my mornings.
And then he reaches into his pocket, and he brings this out to me.
How many of you are single? Any single people out there?
And I'm disturbed by this because I've been openly gay now for quite some time.
So, without further ado, I will present to you, ladies and gentlemen -- now be careful, 'cause it's evil -- a copy, the official copy, of the gay agenda.
But there it is. The gay agenda.
This is the gay agenda: equality. Not special rights, but the rights that were already written by these people -- these elitists, if you will.
There are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don't show anyone who they really are right here at home. This isn't just about North Carolina; all those states that were clear, it's legal.
It doesn't matter what I've already proven, what I can do with my heart.
Now, how about your household energy use?
This is coal, the most common source of electricity on the planet, and there's enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year.
One quarter of the homes received a message that said, did you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer?
And wouldn't you know it, they did.
We started with paper, we moved to a mobile application, web, and now even a controllable thermostat, and for the last five years we've been running the largest behavioral science experiment in the world.
Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted, and when I say wasted, I don't mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs. They may.
So what are we waiting for?
She came over to meet my young daughter, and she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name is also Harriet.
You're born, you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude.
And guess what?
I'm going to become a crotchety old lady.
One third of it, in fact, is genetic.
This upward ascension can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges.
As I lost so much, I finally started to find myself."
How was I supposed to live it?
You may discover, as I did, that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault, a lot of things you used to think about yourself, really had nothing to do with you.
Women start off whole, don't we?
Thank you very much.
You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen.
And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.
They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"
So it probably even feels good for the insect, as well as looking good.
The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.
And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container.
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight, than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing.
And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe you're looking forward to a new game. You've been up too late playing a game.
So this one here, this is the 1980 Olympics.
But it's okay, it's the Red Sox, right?
So I happen to be at dinner with this photographer, and he was talking with another photographer about a shooting that had occurred, and it was on an Indian reservation. He'd taken his camera up there to photograph it, but when he got there, he discovered he couldn't do it. He just couldn't capture the picture. And so they were talking back and forth about this question. Do you take the picture or not?
But Abraham Lincoln was elected president, and then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation, and now they're free.
This was the boat. It was made quickly obviously.
"But what if I saw them? You know, couldn't we stay together?" "No."
I was so excited. It was like, I'd been making games for 20-some years, and then I decided to do it again.
I'm hoping that I'll teach culture through these games.
And so games, for a change, it changes how we see topics, it changes how our perceptions about those people in topics, and it changes ourselves.
As you see, everything starts to fade to black, and you see people going to sleep.
This is looking at ascending versus descending flights.
And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam.
This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine.
I was probably being a little extreme.
And juxtaposed against this grid, you see actually, by rolling over each individual one, the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process.
But only one of them out of the 7,599 said this.
And he says, "It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep.
We decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for, which is making money.
This is what that sounded like.
We wanted to see how this applies to collaborative, distributed music making, where nobody has any idea what it is they're working on.
And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers, but we also open sourced it, and we made it released as a Google Code project, where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it.
And he ended up talking to Rick Rubin, who was finishing up Johnny Cash's final album called "Ain't No Grave."
Collaborator: I felt really sad when he died.
It's the sum total of his life, all the things that had happened -- the bad things, the good things.
And you can pick a style. So this one was tagged "Abstract."
But most importantly, I think, we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project, where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone.
And I left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs.
So the word "silhouette" comes from a minister of finance, Etienne de Silhouette.
I love oddities of languages.
So you can read "architecture active" or "active architecture."
So I want to see how things work and what's happening.
And we can use them also as a safety net.
People tell me their lives, their memories, their aspirations, and I create a mindscape.
"Daily Battles."
There is no border in between.
Here it's an artist book installation called "Identity Project."
So artist books, you take them off the wall.
I called it "Working in the Same Direction."
So I started in the center with the acorn for the Ohlone Indian civilization.
And on the branches you have library material growing.
And here I've been working for the last three years with a South Bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing.
It is a papercutting, and then after, I added color on the computer.
In a way, I've got some bad news, particularly to anybody who's come to Oxford from abroad.
The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery.
I think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods.
We've done away with the caste system.
And she's got a very large house.
Which makes for a very -- can make for a very stressful situation.
There is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious, about our careers, about our status in the world today, than ever before.
There is a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser, and that shows 400 years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives.
According to St. Augustine, it's only God who can really put everybody in their place.
What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others. And it exists.
I remember a few years ago, I was thinking about all this, and I went to see "The Sunday Sport," a tabloid newspaper that I don't recommend you to start reading if you're not familiar with it already.
They really do have a kind of genius all of their own, these guys.
And so we tend to worship ourselves.
And one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means.
So any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on, where the element of loss is.
We are highly open to suggestion.
I mean, do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder, gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy?

What am I going to do with this short amount of time that's just fleeting?
I hadn't swum for 31 years, not a stroke.
I say, "No, it's got to be 15 hours," and I swim another minute out and another minute back to make the 15 hours.
And there's hypothermia.
You've got tight bathing caps over your ears trying to keep the heat of the head, because it's where the hypothermia starts, and so you don't hear very well.
About the 50th hour, I was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe.
I don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm.
Then come convulsions.
The doctor, medical team from University of Miami arrived at five in the morning.
And I gave in to the staged swim.
They should worry about me. I don't worry about them.
And I said, "What's your name?" "Henry."
And little did I know, that you should listen to eight year-olds.
And I can look at the journey, not just the destination.
He said, "Did you know you're going to die the same place you were born, New York City, and it's going to be in January of '35?"
Any guesses? 1816.
In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs, all your vital signs: your heart rhythm, your blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc.
We're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep.
So, we're not just talking about physiologic metrics -- the key measurements of vital signs, and all those things in physiology -- but also all the imaging that one could look at in your smartphone.
Now, I have this device on.
Well, we can. First of all, heart failure is the number one reason for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country.
Here are some things, the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind: "A data-driven health revolution promises to make us all better, faster, and stronger. Living by numbers."
Now, this doesn't appear -- this just doesn't work, I mean, this just doesn't work.
You say, "Oh, OK." And a Z.Q. score is adjusted to age, and you want to get as high as you possibly can.
OK. So, that's the first night.
Eighty percent of Americans have chronic disease, or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have two or more chronic disease, 140 million Americans have one or more chronic disease, and 80 percent of our 1.5, whatever, trillion expenditures are related to chronic disease.
All these things are possible -- some of them are very close, or already, as you heard, are available today, in some way or form.
And that's before we got going on the m-health world.
It's the number one source of commerce, and interestingly it dovetails beautifully with over 500 life science companies.
We can tell who's going to get breast cancer from the various genes.
The other day, I was reading something, and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the West.
Pollution, energy shortage, environmental diversity, poverty.
Most people are about 60 inches high or more, and there's these cube laws. So if you make them this big, by using nanotechnology, I suppose -- -- then you could have a thousand times as many.
The future must have some computers."
As you remember, at some point in the book for "2001," HAL realizes that the universe is too big, and grand, and profound for those really stupid astronauts. If you contrast HAL's behavior with the triviality of the people on the spaceship, you can see what's written between the lines.
What I think is that the gene counters don't know what they're doing yet.
If we do have longevity, then we'll have to face the population growth problem anyway. Because if people live 200 or 1,000 years, then we can't let them have a child more than about once every 200 or 1,000 years.
So I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability.
In fact, understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking -- some of the chemistry, some of the physics and so forth.
And so a few years ago -- fours years ago, actually -- I set out to say, is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder?
But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical, maybe a little bit more scientific, maybe a little bit more chef-y than they otherwise would have.
Once you start cutting things in half, you kind of get carried away, so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan.
Because our hamburger recipe, our ultimate hamburger recipe, if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff, it does take about 30 hours.
And the answer is: no, not really; we use a machine shop.
The great thing is, when you cut something in half, you have another half.
But hey, they grow back.
And it's got this funny horn-shaped thing, which as far as I know, again, the first cookbook to ever do this.
We make every aspect of this burger.
So it's a great illustration of that.
And they're nice big pages too.
And many, many hundreds of skulls like this have been found in archaeological sites all over the world, dating back five to 10 thousand years.
Judging by the healing on the borders of these holes, they lived days, months, years following trephination.
That may have saved the writers, but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much.
Until anesthesia, the absence of sensation.
Surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore; they had become gods.
But there were casualties of this revolution.
And one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external ergonomics are terrible.
And the robot is moving these instruments around, and powering them, down inside the body.
I talked about the large, complicated robot.
And you need to re-set it up.
Or, not so coincidentally, like a tube like this.
But it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we're going around.
We have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body.
And that is not the case.
And that is my vision for your future.
We have a lot of cool celebrations that we're going to do.
It has many contrasts.
And it was at the height of the Cold War.
And you know, those of us with kids often want our kids to take music.
And the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer was essentially that of a good host, anticipating the needs of the guest.
You try things out.
This is a house that Charles and Ray designed.
They focused on the need.
The Eames' film Tops, lower left.
And yet simply by changing the frame of reference it reveals so much, including what ended up being the TED Prize.
So we're going to watch another film.
This is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old.
So, I hope you had a Audience: Nice time, time -- ED: Time at.
ED: And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site, because in the Kymaerican story this is where the Parisian Diaspora started, where there embassy was.
The Tahatchabe, the great road building culture.
You want to learn how to make films? Go make a movie.
It's about how you approach problems. And there is this huge, beautiful commonality between design, business and the world.
And there is solid silver thalis.
And I really think that's where we are.
I saw this leaflet and it said, "There are millions of slaves in the world today."
So, I began to do a research project of my own.
Now, how on Earth did we get to a situation like this, where we have 27 million people in slavery in the year 2010?
If the rule of law is sound, it protects the poor and it protects the vulnerable.
They climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them.
Brent Lawson: Happy to be here.
BL: Daphne, if I may draw your attention to one thing.
MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof, and they've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction, which I think is kind of fun.
These young boys are in Nepal.
His name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghana enslaved in the fishing industry, and he now, after escape and building a new life, has formed an organization that we work closely with to go back and get people out of slavery.
In the United States, North America, much more expensive. Legal costs, medical costs ...
They become consumers and producers and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly.
We'd been working there about a month.
And yet, if there's one thing that every human being can agree on, I think it's that slavery should end.
And that's actually crucial because if we're going to get increased investment in early childhood programs, we need to interest state governments in this.
They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks.
Now, one objection you often hear, or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it, is, why should I pay more taxes to invest in other people's children?
As another example, if we look at what determines an individual's wages, and we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages, we know that the individual's wages will depend, in part, on that individual's education, for example whether or not they have a college degree.
And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out.
So what are the barriers to getting it done?
So this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the state's population and produces large and tangible benefits.
Are we still capable of that as a country?
Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter, and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature.
However, inside a superconductor there are no collisions, so there is no energy dissipation.
Why? Because it is a quantum phenomenon. It's quantum physics.
So we get quantum locking. And let me show you how this works.
It's a remarkable effect. It's very strong.
But we can also store energy using superconductors, because we have no dissipation.
But, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now.
I had maybe nine months.
He had misheard me and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster, and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines.
So I ended up going to the History of Science Library and looking at this book.
It's not anymore, but I found a retired geology professor to take me down, and he said, "Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine."
Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods.
But this is it.
So there was 240 volts going through these homemade copper wires, homemade plug.
If I take 30 steps linearly -- one, two, three, four, five -- I get to 30.
Which will happen around 2020.
We went to the fourth paradigm, transistors, and finally integrated circuits.
And I was asked, "Well aren't you nervous?
And it's also true of other examples, like DNA data or brain data.
But that was really right on schedule.
And there is 10 thousand times more sunlight than we need.
But Larry Page made an impassioned speech at our organizing meeting, saying we should devote this study to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity.
There are different programs for graduate students, for executives at different companies.
There were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water.
No one was lost there. But the water continued to climb.
For hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around -- all of this was from the houses in the slum.
At the Phi Phi Hill Resort, I was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television, but I strained to listen for information.
Voice 2: It's coming again?
They are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and, to some extent, the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job.
So, Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this and, I think, is writing about this more, but this notion of voluntary cooperation is an incredibly powerful one, and one worth thinking about.
For instance, if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack, they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win.
But there is a dark side to this, and that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on.
It is, as Steven Johnson has talked about, an emergent phenomenon.
You know, this is a conference inspired by nature.
You saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic.
And they deserve more than that."
We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom; you don't need the ones in the last two fingers.
It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and MRIs of whatever is their good arm, to make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D -- exact mirror image of their other limb.
Now he's going to put that down, pick up a piece of paper, rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist, and read it.
If you were to descend into the 95 percent of the biosphere that's livable, it would quickly become pitch black, interrupted only by pinpoints of light from bioluminescent organisms.
And Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it.
It's around 1900.
And so what they found, in fact, is that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans.
But for the most part, we've gone from salting to exhausting.
And so we can send out sound waves, they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back.
Now I realize for those of you who are colorblind, this slide is not very helpful, but stick with me nonetheless.
Now one of the nicest examples I like to cite on this is the story of two young women, high school students in New York City, who worked with the census.
What I've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand.
So what did we find?
You can do this on a global scale, but you can also do it on a regional scale.
And it shows that the ocean, because of its vastness, can hide secrets for a very long time.
But it was only discovered in the early 1980s.
So our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms.
But you can imagine the biomass that represents.
And so the importance then of global collaboration becomes all the more important.
And the oceans are so productive, there's so much going on in there that's of relevance to humans that we really need to, even from a selfish perspective, try to do better than we have in the past.
Thank you.
Well, it's been around for 2,500 years.
So not only do we do the veggie house, we also do the in-vitro meat habitat, or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn, where, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one.
And there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it.
If there's one operation for a disease, you know it works.
There are different paradigms.
"The world will not be saved by the Internet."
And I think that it's going to be, in time, the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days.
What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves, out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit?
But beyond our compassion, and far greater than compassion, is our moral imagination and our identification with each individual who lives in that world, not to think of them as a huge forest, but as individual trees.
Remember, I have been talking about, essentially philanthropy: the love of humankind, the individual humankind and the individual humankind that can bring that kind of love translated into action, translated, in some cases, into enlightened self-interest.
If you think about this question for any length of time, it's blindingly obvious why we have a brain.
But we can look at how well we're doing by thinking about how well we're doing building machines which can do what humans can do.
One reason is a very smart five year-old could tell you the algorithm for that top problem -- look at all possible moves to the end of the game and choose the one that makes you win.
But it doesn't do it with anything like the agility of a human.
So in my group, what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement.
So for example, if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand, you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback.
Now what I want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to reduce the negative consequences of this sort of noise and variability.
So we're going to represent a belief with a number between zero and one -- zero meaning I don't believe it at all, one means I'm absolutely certain.
And it has real beauty and real explanatory power.
And to do that, I'll tell you about how the brain deals with sensory input.
Well there's good reasons.
Everything left over is external to me.
I'll show you just one part of our study.
So whatever is responsible for this cancellation is extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality.
Now I happen to know my children don't lie, so I thought, as a neuroscientist, it was important how I could explain how they were telling inconsistent truths.
And the game is very simple.
And if we look at what we start with, a quarter of a Newton there, a number of turns, perfect would be that red line.
You will know what this person is doing, whether happy, sad, old, young -- a huge amount of information.
Imagine I want to intercept this ball.
So if I have to choose between those two, I would choose the right one because it's less variable.
And finally, I want to remind you, when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks, the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain is really quite dramatic.
DW: So people have found out for example that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision is a mistake.
It's a dead world. NASA should not spend any time or effort studying Mars anymore."
This is the first photograph taken from the surface of any planet.
Mars has the largest impact crater in the solar system, Hellas Basin.
Here is some picture of Antarctica and a picture of Olympus Mons, very similar features, glaciers.
Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go?
Why is methane important?
And this terrain that we're looking at dates back to 4.6 billion years when Earth and Mars were formed.
But look in the southern hemisphere.
It's an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor.
But more important we will inspire the next generation of scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians.
The problem is we don't fly it to Mars, we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to Mars.
How do we know we can do it?
And we've done high-altitude and low-altitude tests, just to perfect this technique.
We are on the verge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the Earth's atmosphere.
It's totally appropriate for a four-year-old.
And we put down those little floor tiles, and then I went onto eBay and bought 150 pounds of Lego -- which is insane.
And you go to one of these conventions, and some dude built the Titanic.
And I was just like, "Yeah, I guess I am.
I have to take a moment.
Okay.
All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me.
And so, I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that and four lessons I've learned in the last year.
These are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology.
The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter, and they matter enormously.
It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing.
In fact, policy is paramount.
I think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why?
That's 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country.
And in doing so, they'll save a million lives -- at least a million lives a year. A million lives.
I guess that's better living through bugs.
Second fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total.
Not enough to stabilize the climate.
We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome, the profitable outcome, and therefore the likely outcome.
Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com and buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating, lobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions.
For the last 10 years, I've been spending my time trying to figure out how and why human beings assemble themselves into social networks.
So here on the Y-axis, we have the percent of the people affected, and on the X-axis, we have time.
And the lines represent -- the dots are the people, and the lines represent friendship relationships.
Some people have one connection, some have two, some have six, some have 10 connections.
A, in fact, is more central, and this can be formalized mathematically.
But shifted to the left is what's occurring in the central individuals.
The friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree, and are more central than the random people themselves.
And also, we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week.
And that, as indicated by the white line, occurred 46 days before the peak of the epidemic.
If I'm likely to do something that affects others around me, this technique can get early warning or early detection about the adoption within the population.
Well, some other scientists have estimated what would happen if you took a 30 percent random sample of these 1000 people, 300 people and immunized them.
Every dot is a person, and every line represents a volume of calls between the people.
And we see a blip up in the truckers' purchases of fuel, and we know that a recession is about to end.
And collect vast amounts of information about people's temperature, but from centrally located individuals.
I think of new cities like Dubai or ancient cities like Rome with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum, or like right here in New York with the High Line, a city which has been so much influenced by the development of this.
The building was under construction until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early '90s.
And with each inhabitant finding their own unique way of coming by, this tower becomes like a living city, a place which is alive with micro-economies and small businesses.
Electricity is rigged and freshest water comes from self-built wells throughout the area.
They're descendants of farmers who began migrating from the upper Egypt in the '40s, and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over Cairo.
Like Makoko and the Torre David, throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood.
But then in the apartment across the hall from this cow shed lives a newly married couple in what locals describe as one of the nicest apartments in the area.
From Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities have approached the tasks of planning, design and management of their communities and neighborhoods in ways that respond specifically to their environment and circumstances.

The librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives, "What are the names of Santa's reindeer?"
By the way, the wages for librarians went up faster than the wages for other jobs in the U.S. over that same time period, because librarians became partners of computers.
In fact, robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways.
This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics.
Here Chris took the object out of its hand, and Baxter didn't go and try to put it down; it went back and realized it had to get another one.
He's going to put something in its hand, he's going to bring it over here, press a button and let go of that thing in the hand.
These robots we're shipping every day.
The universal answer was "No, I want a better job than that for my children."
That's climate change and demographics.
That's happening statistically right now.
With two mirrors, the scanner calculates the beam's horizontal and vertical angles, giving accurate x, y, and z coordinates.
And unfortunately, there was no detailed documentation of these Buddhas.
What you're looking at in here is a 3D viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of [the] cloud of points in real time, cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions.
The more I got involved in the heritage field, the more it became clear to me that we are losing the sites and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them.
And we created a project we call the CyArk 500 Challenge -- and that is to digitally preserve 500 World Heritage Sites in five years.
Our answer, of course, was yes.
This is all in 3D and of course you can fly through the cloud of points.
Thank you.
And the reason I give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it.
Now here -- and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon -- there is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century, and that is that, almost out of nowhere, there has come into being an anti-genocide movement, an anti-genocide constituency, and one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent.
But it has been amazingly successful in one regard, in that it has become, it has congealed into this endangered people's movement that was missing in the 20th century.
And the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that, and there's always something to do.
So we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century, and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here, as we speak.
Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude naturally or eagerly.
The recovery's going to take some time.
He was successful with women.
He negotiates with the Serbs.
Or do you continue feeding the civilians, knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps, literally sharpening their knives for future battle?
Well, if you denounce, you're probably never going to get back in the room.
But all they had was a woman's handbag -- literally one of those basket handbags -- and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters, and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building in the interests of rescuing this person, the person we most need to turn to now, this shepherd, at a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance.
He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers, he would charge up to people who were violating international law, and he would say, you're violating, this is the U.N. Charter.
Don't black-box history. Don't check your principles at the door.
We put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we've spent three billion.
Let's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats, but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic, of a fear.
But what I'd like to talk about today is the fact that this morning, about a billion people on Earth -- or one out of every seven -- woke up and didn't even know how to fill this cup.
The destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history.
In 1987, I was a new mother with my first child and was holding her and feeding her when an image very similar to this came on the television.
We actually have the technology and systems.
But today I'm going to talk about access to food, because actually this year and last year and during the 2008 food crisis, there was enough food on Earth for everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories.
So this burden of knowledge drives me.
This message, this word, can come out that this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business; it's a brilliant way of saving your child's life.
We did this with food technologists in India and Pakistan -- really about three of them.
Families need the help.
Food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons.
I love this idea that came from the village level: three keys to unlock that warehouse.
It says "bon appetit" in Arabic.
And guess what?
And they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity.
The amazing thing I've found is nothing can change on a big scale without the determination of a leader.
Not only that, transforming hunger is an opportunity, but I think we have to change our mindsets.
This is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell.
I co-founded a company called Navigenics, where, if you spit into a tube -- and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease, all of which are delayable in many of the cancers -- you start to identify what you could get, and then we can start to work to prevent them.
It starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells, what we call clonal selection.
So, it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer, and giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it.
Why? Because we know what you have, and we know how to treat it -- although we can't make vaccine in this country, but that's a different story.
If you could start to move that, to identify what you're up against, you're going to do things a hell of a lot better.
Cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment.
And, believe it or not, there were hisses in the audience.
And so, if you think of cancer as a system, there's an input and an output and a state in the middle.
The good news is you can manipulate them.
Nobody has ever shown -- and this will be shocking -- nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy actually touches a cancer cell.
It's not. We have no idea the mechanism.
So the diseases we have today, which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades, are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this.
She had gotten Carboplatin Taxol, Carboplatin Taxotere, Gemcitabine, Navelbine: Every drug we have she had gotten, and that disease continued to grow.
So, it was done on this group of patients.
You don't need to shrink the disease.
Danny and I got 16 million dollars, they announced yesterday, to try to attach this problem.
We need to start to think differently and radically.
We stand on street corners, shouting over noise like this, and pretending that it doesn't exist.
There is a deep resonance with being at rest.
The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively.
With all that other stuff going on, it would be amazing if our behavior didn't change.
I want to spend just a moment talking about the model that we've developed, which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound, analyze the soundscape and then predict the four outcomes I've just talked about.
Now, those are one-second samples of music.
Sound is complex. There are many countervailing influences.
And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine, Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely.
Some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them that could give way at a moment's notice, taking your sled, you, into the abyss, never to be seen again.
Around that time I met an extraordinary human being, Peter Thum, who inspired me with his actions.
One of my favorite: It's 40 below, you've got to go to the bathroom, where are you going to go and how are you going to do it?
The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole.
I'm learning this at 40.
I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child," asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time.
We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it.
Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment.
New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth.
Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth.
One-way trips are easy.
That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton.
Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path.
There are still some blue whales.
Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph.
The next 10 years may be the most important, and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life.
We need deep-diving subs, new technologies to explore the ocean.
Thank you.
And so I want to show you a high-speed video sequence of a fly shot at 7,000 frames per second in infrared lighting, and to the right, off-screen, is an electronic looming predator that is going to go at the fly.
And you might have heard how engineers proved that bumblebees couldn't fly.
But attached to the base of the wing is a set of little, tiny control muscles that are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast, and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing on a stroke-by-stroke basis, and this is what enables the fly to change its wing and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces which change its flight trajectory.
They can even taste with their wings.
Now, how many people here think the Trump number is higher for the fruit fly?
They have sex. They hide from predators.
So this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse that came from Jeff Lichtman's lab, and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk.
So this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience.
But I'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing.
You select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior, another neuromodulator, another set of cells, a different pattern, and you can imagine you could extrapolate to a very, very complicated system.
But very, very recently, it's been possible to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies.
Octopamine is a neuromodulator that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors.
Now, even at this stage, we can use the brain model to explore some fundamental questions about how the brain works.
Without decisions you cannot see, you cannot think, you cannot feel.
But I cannot say, "You think, therefore you are," because "you" are within my perceptual bubble.
But the real big step was the neocortex.
They were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull.
But it's not only education.
How many trees does it have?
And a synapse is a chemical location where they communicate with each other.
And when we do that what we discovered is that the circuitry does change.
It's like electrical shock that releases the chemicals from these synapses.
Take the magic carpet for a ride.
Because that is what it's creating.
We can do it within 10 years, and if we do succeed, we will send to TED, in 10 years, a hologram to talk to you. Thank you.
That's me and my sister, Esther, who's a frequent TEDster.
That's right on the coast at La Jolla.
These are the statistics of what would be the good places to go and stop.
These are stills from film footage that was saved by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn't and kept it in their basement for the last 40 years.
They got quite serious about the engineering of this.
So this is what NASA did, getting an eight man version that would go to Mars.
And one part of NASA was interested in it but the headquarters in NASA, they killed the project.
That's the good news. The bad news is, when I got in contact with these people to try and get some documents from them, they went crazy because I had all this stuff that they don't have, and NASA purchased 1,759 pages of this stuff from me.
Most vaccines are delivered with the needle and syringe, this 160-year-old technology.
Now, related to this is another key issue, which is needlestick injuries.
And there's about 4,000 projections on this particular square compared to the needle.
Now that safe germ, that antigen, tricks our body into mounting an immune response, learning and remembering how to deal with intruders.
It's off the grid entirely.
It's getting more systematic.
So the red line is mostly below that curve and indeed there's only one point that is achieved with the needle that's protective, and that's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms.
They're responsible for about 7 million deaths per year, and there is no adequate vaccination method for any of those.
The WHO estimates that within Africa, up to half the vaccines used there are considered to not be working properly because at some point the cold chain has fallen over.
We've started with Papua New Guinea.
It's challenging, but there's nothing else in the world I'd rather be doing.
So I said, "You know, I really don't want to write about my research.
People write me about their personal experience, and about their examples, and what they disagree, and nuances.
No, right? It's impossible.
Here is another one -- this is one of my favorite illusions.
But again it's the same story that if we take the background away, the illusion comes back. Right.
Because in visual illusions we can easily demonstrate the mistakes; in cognitive illusion it's much, much harder to demonstrate to people the mistakes.
Or maybe it is about religion.
You know the expression, "Begging only gets you so far"?
Now it's also very hard to intuit these results. Think about it for yourself.
It's not because it's trivial. It's not because we don't care.
Here is a patient. He is a 67-year-old farmer.
Or do you let them go and have hip replacement?"
What happens now?
Or a weekend in Paris?
But guess what happened. The moment you add Rome without coffee, Rome with coffee becomes more popular. And people choose it.
And I called them up. And they went to check what was going on.
People believe that when we deal with physical attraction, we see somebody, and we know immediately whether we like them or not, attracted or not.
And the question was, will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom help their respective, more attractive brothers?
What is the general point?
We build steps. And we build these things that not everybody can use obviously.
And with these mobile phones, we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data every month.
And it's this limitation that doesn't cope with the demand of wireless data transmissions and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month.
In hospitals, they are security issues.
Then there's ultraviolet light.
Can we use them for communications?
You all know remote controls have an infrared LED -- basically you switch on the LED, and if it's off, you switch it off.
And I'm showing for the first time in public this visible light demonstrator.
So what happens when I switch on that light?
Once again.
And the answer is yes.
That's aside.
You would agree with me that light doesn't penetrate through walls.
We call it, in fact, a Li-Fi, light-fidelity.
What's happening in genomics, and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world, life, ourselves, and how we think about them.
How's your genome today? Have you thought about it lately?
The DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes.
Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters: A, T, C, G; they represent the name of a chemical.
And look at all the complex things and wonderful things we've been able to create with just a one and a zero.
In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time, like cancer, we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level.
You might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes.
In other words, the first couple of sentences here, assuming this is a grape plant: make a root, make a branch, create a blossom.
You can find out where your relatives come from; you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years.
If you have a UTI, you've probably -- or ever had a UTI -- you've come in contact with this little bug.
The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism, and they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes.
They're not grown from seeds; they're grafted into root stock; they would not exist in nature on their own.
Our ocean's teaming with microbes; in fact, when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean, in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water.
I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe.
And, you know, people would always ask James Watson -- he's not always the most politically correct guy ...
So, carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar, not anything.
And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.
So the human says, "You're going to act this way, damn it.
I mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.
And the reason is built into their behavior -- is to always come back and apologize.
I said, "Let's teach him to sit."
My wife doesn't need food -- she's a great trainer, much better than I am.
He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know, wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something, and take him a little message that says, "Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner."
They open doors, they drive my car, they massage me, they will throw tennis balls, they will cook for me and serve the food.
This is a life-or-death thing.
It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.
The breaks got fewer and fewer.
This is crazy.
The dog says, "I don't think so."
I'm standing right here with my bag.
He kicked a child, grabs the child like this and I let it go.
When I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz.
This should be taught in schools.
I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire.
And the third is that it challenges -- and this is, in the length of this, very hard to support why, connect all these things -- but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility.
They can be pushed off-center a little bit, but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped.
The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility.
What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left.
So that literally was the design of the building.
That metal acts as a micro louver, so from the exterior of the building the sun sees it as totally opaque, but from the interior it's entirely transparent.
It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space.
I can show this to you later.
And the very fact that they worked on a provisional space meant that for Beckett they could blow out a wall; they could do "Cherry Orchard" and blow a hole through the floor, and so forth.
So in fact, we can go, using operational budget, we can -- sorry, capital cost -- we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost.
You can bring enormous objects in, so in fact their -- the Dallas Theater Company -- their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh, and they'll want to bring in [a] real aircraft.
They came to us and they said -- unlike normal developers -- they said, "We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville. That's our main goal."
Have to operate behind the I-64 corridor, a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites.
So, we begin by building the cores.
William Kamkwamba: Thanks.
WK: Yeah.
WK: Yeah.
WK: Yeah. The windmill.
WK: This is my parents, holding the radio.
So that would produce irrigation for the entire village?
Well, there's lots to talk about, but I think I'm just going to play to start off.
So I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody.
So, I've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves, if that's possible.
Quiet Quiet down, she said Speak into the back of his head On the edge of the bed, I can see your blood flow I can see your cells grow Hold still awhile Don't spill the wine I can see it all from here I can see oh, I I can see weather systems of the world Weather systems of the world Some things you say are not for sale I would hold it where our free agents of some substance are scared Hold still a while Don't spill the wine I can see it all from here I can see oh, I I can see weather systems of the world Weather systems of the world Thanks.
I'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots -- a little deeper and a lot closer, to my mind, than work.
I'm asking you to do this because I believe our personal perceptions, you see, are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge.
Four is blue.
But it's not only numbers that I see in colors.
64 multiplied by 75.
Most people, a majority of people, say sad.
It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head.
Thank you.
Child mortality is down by two-thirds.
These are both real objects.
Of course there were a few changes, but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.
They've come together.
It's a unique human feature.
Well no, because if you think about it, if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes, and then they trade, then they will each have saved an hour of work.
How long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.
It was self-sufficiency.
In the old days, if you were rich, you literally had people working for you.
Ants are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers.
And how long has it been going on? And what does it mean?
All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it's big enough to share some.
But there's no evidence of a sexual division of labor.
And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress, you can actually throw it into reverse.
In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.
And what we've done in human society, through exchange and specialization, is we've created the ability to do things that we don't even understand.
We're the neurons in this brain.
And what I mean by that, it's the behaviors that we're in denial about, and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness.
And in fact, this is one million plastic cups, which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the United States every six hours.
That's as high as a 42-story building, and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference.
Every time I look at this piece, I always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad, "He finally folded his laundry."
This is just lots and lots of cigarettes: 65,000 cigarettes, which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month, and every month in the U.S.
It's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift, given to young girls who are about to go off to college.
They've gone missing; these feelings have gone missing.
My belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues.
How can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology into a simple, hand-held, single diagnostic assay?
This is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop.
Well, for a long time, since I was in graduate school, I've been messing around making DNA chips -- that is, printing DNA on glass.
You can actually be making DNA chips in your garage and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun.
And so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here; it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing.
You have tissue culture cells. There are a ton of viruses.
This is all IRB-approved, by the way; they got paid.
Day two: we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern, and it's very similar to what we get in the lab doing our tissue culture experiment.
Well, doesn't have canine distemper; that's probably good.
Everything that we could get out of GenBank -- that is, the national repository of sequences.
That's the idea, and we're setting this up in the Bay Area.
OK. So, the patient was treated then with a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline, and on day three, it didn't help: she had progressed to acute failure.
Well, what the hell's parainfluenza-4?
Prostate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it: third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.
And what I'm telling you here from the signal, is that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme, and have a tumor, often have -- 40 percent of the time -- a signature which reveals a new retrovirus.
They all have the same virus, but they're different enough that there's reason to believe that they've been independently acquired.
We have a strong association between the presence of this virus and a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer.
But coal plants, nuclear plants can't respond fast enough.
Now the theme of this year's TED Conference is Full Spectrum.
Until Volta, nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use.
You're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter.
And I did.
Magnesium for the top layer.
It's pretty cool, at least in theory.
And that allowed me to expand my group to 20 people, a mix of graduate students, post-docs and even some undergraduates.
And then it was onto the saucer.
And one variant of the technology has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules, aggregating the modules into a giant battery that fits in a 40-foot shipping container for placement in the field.
Liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature with minimum regulation.
So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle, which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra-thin tether back to the computer topside.
So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the Sierras.
But then we had to learn how to make them.
The real potential, the long term potential, is with this community of DIY ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe.
One of my favorite shows as a kid was "The Six Million Dollar Man," and this is a little bit closer to the 240 dollar man or so, but -- At at any rate. I would normally feel very self-conscious and geeky wearing this around, but a few days ago I saw one world-renowned statistician swallowing swords on stage here, so I figure it's OK amongst this group.
And since they discovered those things, it really stuck with them so much more, and also they would experience their own failures; there was a failure-based aspect to learning there. It was very important.
Things where you might trip across things like the Copernican Principle, the Fermi Paradox, the Anthropic Principle, the origin of life.
And as we start growing the camera will actually start zooming out, and things that you see in the background there will actually start slowly pulling into the foreground, showing you a little bit of what you'll be interacting with as you grow.
I can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel, so you sculpt it like clay. We have parts here that I can put on or pull off.
But really the goal here was, within about a minute, I wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create.
It's looking at whatever I've designed. It will actually bring it to life.
But I'm going to skip way ahead here. Now, normally what would happen is these creatures would work their way up, eventually become intelligent.
Almost, again, like the Montessori toy idea.
In fact, I can look over here, and this is kind of a little simplified food web that's going on with the creatures.
There's actually a little read out down there of our planetary atmosphere, pressure and temperature.
Now here, our entire oceans are evaporating off the surface, and as it keeps getting hotter at some point the entire planet's going to melt down.
I think I'll leave before they get hostile.
I want to basically have the entire zoo of Hubble objects that people can kind of interact with and play with, again, as toys.
You might be a networking god, building alliances, which you can also do in the game, or just curious, going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can.
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.
So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior, or body language -- but we call it nonverbals as social scientists -- it's language, so we think about communication.
If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?
So you make yourself big, you stretch out, you take up space, you're basically opening up.
We make ourselves small. We don't want to bump into the person next to us.
So my main collaborator Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley, and I really wanted to know, can you fake it till you make it?
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like?
So do you want the high-power leader that's dominant, high on testosterone, but really stress reactive?
Here are a couple more.
So this is what we find. Risk tolerance, which is the gambling, what we find is that when you're in the high-power pose condition, 86 percent of you will gamble.
So this is in the lab. It's this little task, you know, it's just a couple of minutes. Where can you actually apply this? Which we cared about, of course.
You are, you know, you're looking at your notes, you're hunching up, making yourself small, when really what you should be doing maybe is this, like, in the bathroom, right? Do that. Find two minutes.
They're blind to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions.
So I'm taken out of college, I keep trying to go back.
She was like, "You are not quitting, because I took a gamble on you, and you're staying.
I don't feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling.
The last thing I'm going to leave you with is this.
I don't have ego involved in this.
Beaver dams, yes. Hoover Dam, no.
Well then, why is it doing this?
This is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course.
And you have to have a bumper sticker, you know. You have to have a statement.
Well, how are we going to think about this?
And he's not responsible for what I say about memes.
That's what Richard said, back in '93.
What's a word made of?
Not just the priests. Everybody.
A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness.
And we're doing it again.
That is not the job of the science of memetics.
What you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence.
I, as the conductor, have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense of the outer architecture of that music, within which there is then immense personal freedom for the members of the orchestra to shine.
And in my game, that means you overgesticulate.
I have to say, in those days, I couldn't really even find the bird.
So how do we recover from that, ladies and gentlemen?
Something which I find utterly enchanting about South African music making is that it's so free.
And if I can broaden this out for a second, I'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room would be happy to speak with acuity, with total confidence, about movies, probably about literature.
Oh my goodness me, there it was loud and clear, surely.
And look, if you're adventurous, you go up the octave.
It wasn't a bad debut for the TED choir, not a bad debut at all.
It's called Paraorchestra.
I'm 22, and I'm a left-handed pianist.
If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point, please let me know.
I'm pleased to say, the prince did take the tip from the orchestral performance, and the musicians were reunited with their families.
We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously, my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again.
What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us, with the confluence of fear, ethnic strife and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda, that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid.
And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today, it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history, is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor, in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable.
Who are these people?
This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.
Something I truly believe.
One: production is too low. Two: price is too high.
So the production side is working.
We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies, and quickly did a prototyping on this, and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives.
Seventeen doesn't divide by two.
You get 17.
And it's a big family reunion, and yet, like many family reunions, it's not all peace and light.
The secret to peace is us.
And if tempers are still too high, then they send someone off to visit some relatives as a cooling-off period.
Human beings -- we're reaction machines.
Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico."
How could we possibly go to the balcony?
What would that mean? What is the story there?
So in that sense, he's the symbolic third side of the Middle East.
How would you bring that story to life?
Walking, it's funny, when you walk, you walk side-by-side in the same common direction.
And so we studied the idea at Harvard.
How many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood, or strange land, and a total stranger, perfect stranger, comes up to you and shows you some kindness, maybe invites you into their home, gives you a drink, gives you a coffee, gives you a meal?
Men, women, young people, old people -- more women than men, actually, interestingly.
He said it was like a light that went on in our lives.
Now the acorn is associated with the oak tree, of course -- grows into an oak tree, which is associated with Abraham.
It was done in South Africa.
After a TEDTalk, why not a TEDWalk?
I don't think anyone in this room would disagree.
A man called Yami Lester, an Aboriginal man, was running a health service.
That was our task.
We work with the community, not telling them what was going to happen in a language they didn't understand.
I want you all to select one of the houses of the 25 houses you see on the screen.
Those ticks and crosses represent the 7,800 houses we've looked at nationally around Australia, the same proportion.
By the evening of the first day, a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning.
I think there's an obvious question that I hope you're thinking about.
It's one of the almost rock-solid pieces of evidence, which I've never seen evidence for, that's always ruled out as that's the problem with indigenous housing.
It's a developing world illness, and yet, the picture you see behind is in an Aboriginal community in the late 1990s where 95 percent of school-aged kids had active trachoma in their eyes doing damage.
So we used dirt to stop dust.
When the bug was in the gut, he'd send back by return post some dung beetles.
Health was poor.
Kanji Maya, she's a mother and a proud one.
None of those are limited by geography, by skin color or by religion. None of them.
And along the way I've started noticing -- I'm on my third generation of kids -- that they're getting bigger.
The crazy teacher -- that's me on the left, I dress up pretty, thank you, my wife, I love you for getting a good suit -- my passionate borough president and a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this patented technology.
But again, I am not a farmer. I'm a teacher.
Now, Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much, we no longer need work permits, which comes with slices and bonded contractors -- we're available for you -- We decided to go to Boston.
And we started putting in roofs that look like this, and we came in from destitute neighborhoods to start building landscape like this, wow! People noticed.
I don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed or, you know, some shelving, I gotta wait six months for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me.
Lorna Sass came and donated books.
I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York made sense, especially when the resources were free.
And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed, because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine.
And I love it! And so do they.
And when you expand their palates, you expand their vocabulary.
We're also becoming children of the corn, creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness and window bottles out of garbage.
This is a beautiful moment.
The rest are scheduled to graduate this June.
Make them a healthy plate, especially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom -- delicioso!
So here, and at a time when we've gone from the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity, I urge you to do something.
Thank you, God bless you and enjoy the day. I'm Steve Ritz.
Thus 900,000 people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle.
Well, the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage that will trigger an emergency alarm, vibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone.
Look at the difference there. It doesn't take much -- every layperson could see that difference, and computers can be programmed to easily detect it.
We have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five years without needing replacement.
Tonight you'll see some of our invented stents.
It's not all that bad; you decide not to do anything.
Then it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack, your signal appears on the screen of a computer and the computer analyzes what your problem is.
If you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law, which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water -- that's your brains by the way -- it'll generate electric currents, and the electric current in the brain can erase a migraine headache.
It's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side.
Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight, with a small and portable machine that literally zaps your migraines away.
Robert Fischell: And that is the invention to treat migraines.
Now, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono, have to get into all these technical words.
And tonight, you'll be able to see the device in the tent.
If the electrical signals create a brain disorder, electro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons.
I think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns.
Well, how can the TED community help with this situation?
Well, then let's go to a simpler explanation.
These are just some starting points.
And our system was rudimentary. It was very basic.
It's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
So what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now.
So, thank you very much.
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook.
So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one.
I took it out for the first time to come here.
They've been swept away over the last two decades by these types of world-flattening digitization technologies, right?
In particular, textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school.
OK, everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages.
Over the last six-and-a-half years, we've been working really hard at Rice University on a project called Connexions, and so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with Connexions, which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday, where they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world.
It's a new university in California, in the Central Valley, working very closely with community colleges.
Just to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook.
And I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing.
Oh, great, so it's the future of the web, right?
And my day job, as Chris said, I'm an electrical engineering professor.
Imagine music XML that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music, play with it, understand it.
So, what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning and what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe, and makes it easily understandable, and the inspiration here is taken from open-source software, things like Linux and the GPL.
Behind that is the legal code, so if you want to very carefully construct it, and creative commons is taking off -- over 43 million things out there, licensed with a creative commons license.
So, thanks very much.
And the first is pretty obvious.
And one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking, in the sense that a lot of it's driven by the learner himself or herself.
And they go home at night; they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity.
The days of pilot projects are over, when people say, "Well, we'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works."
We're interested in big displays, bright displays.
We have partners; it's not hard to guess Google would be one; the others are all playing to pending.
So that piece disappears, and then you have display and everything else.
The dual mode display -- the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors -- isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight?
And this is again something that people don't believe, but I really think it's quite true.
At least you can then decide whether it goes left or -- oh, simulcast. Sorry! I forgot. I forgot. OK, so wherever the camera is -- OK, good point. Thank you, Chris.
By law you've got to bid, and so on and so forth.
If you look at the countries, they're pretty geoculturally distributed.
So we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010.
The economics of this is to start with the federal governments, and then later to go to other -- whether it's child-to-child funding, so a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world, maybe of the same gender, maybe of the same age.
Are we dreaming? Is this real? It actually is real.
I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said, "Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens, and look at these fascinating cultures, and look at these curious rituals that everybody's doing around this technology.
And if you actually lose that information, it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind, that you suddenly feel like something's missing, except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.
So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say, "I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future."
And I said, "I want to do that."
They would click on a button, and they would be connected as A to B immediately.
And so what happens is, when we bring all that into the social space, we end up checking our phones all the time.
And so this is very important.
And really, it ends up being more human than technology, because we're co-creating each other all the time.
We talk about things in relative terms.
And yet, the reality in resource-poor countries, in the absence of tests and treatment, 40 percent -- 40 percent of children are infected -- 40 percent versus two percent -- an enormous difference.
And where do they come from?
The truth is sub-Saharan Africa has 24 percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers.
These women are here for care, but we know that just doing a test, just giving someone a drug, it's not enough.
And then they give you another test and they tell you you're HIV-positive, and you're devastated.
They're drinking tea, they're having sandwiches.
Our organization, mothers2mothers, enlists women with HIV as care providers.
And the third, and maybe the most grand, is to find ways to empower women, enable them to fight the stigma and to live positive and productive lives with HIV.
Disclosure is so central to prevention.
The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction.
I've been afraid to tell everybody."
I tell them, "You are going to make it, and you will raise a healthy baby."
We've chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor, a nurse and a mentor mother.
They become leaders within their communities.
It was at that point, just the spark of an idea.
In the past decade or so, mainly due to advances in brain imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages, and to track changes in brain structure and brain function, so we use structural MRI if you'd like to take a snapshot, a photograph, at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain, and we can ask questions like, how much gray matter does the brain contain, and how does that change with age?
So MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence.
So I like to show a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work.
In this task, you see a set of shelves.
So we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults, and we also have a control condition where there's no director and instead we give people a rule.
I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine who said that the thing he noticed most about his teenage daughters before and after puberty was their level of embarrassment in front of him.
They take more risks than children or adults, and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they're with their friends. There's an important drive to become independent from one's parents and to impress one's friends in adolescence.
So what's sometimes seen as the problem with adolescents — heightened risk-taking, poor impulse control, self-consciousness — shouldn't be stigmatized.
When I was in college, I decided to study engineering, like him.
Now, this was a project, an engineering project, and we published some papers on the design, the system design of it, but we also thought of it as an art installation.
So he and I started working together, and we coined a new term: telepistemology, the study of knowledge at a distance.
So we got a chance to take the Tele-Actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco, and that year, Sam Donaldson was the host.
So, the success of the Tele-Actor that night was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor.
And this is something that's grown out of a system called the da Vinci surgical robot, and this is a commercially available device.
So we record all these examples, the data, and then we go through a sequence of steps.
Here's seven times.
So he changed Kaesava's spelling.
I believe in the concept of a Raja Yogi: Be a dude before you can become an ascetic.
I was so upset.
We actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems.
And I rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory, you know? And if technology is not a metaphor for memory, what is it?
So Netra and I really wanted to use our 200-year plan to curate this digital legacy, and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future.
I didn't know TED then, but what I did was I closed my eyes tight, and I started dreaming. I could imagine people coming in, dressed up, looking beautiful, my paintings with all the light, and in my visualization I actually saw a very famous actress launching my show, giving credibility to me.
I actually went and sat in on her class. She started by giving students primary source documents from India, Pakistan, from Britain, and I said, "Wow." Then she asked them to separate fact from bias.
I like to think of myself as a storyteller, where my past and my future are only stories, my stories, waiting to be told and retold. I hope all of you one day get a chance to share and write your own 200-year story.
What I discovered was this is not true.
These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight.
This is what I found out.
I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices, by buying our food directly from local farmers, or our neighbors who we know in real life.
Not too long ago, my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal.
And I thought that there was -- I thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that.
Images of limb regeneration and faces filled with smallpox: 21 percent of the conference.
And you can -- you can use really natural hand gestures to like, go like this.
And now we're going to have kind of a little more visualization about Rick Warren.
But Darwin's dangerous idea is coming back. It's coming back.
Has to be visible in bright daylight. Will work anywhere.
Are we going to be able to find any marijuana, Jim Young?
Day five and day six.
And the really wonderful thing about this is, when you're done, well -- you can eat it.
OK, so, Einstein, what's your favorite singing group?
Then Portuguese to Pig Latin.
It's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit.
And finally, we're going to put the Marriott Hotel and the Portola Plaza on the top.
Luckily, I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year.
But over the years, 10 years later, the snow packs eroded, and, if you notice, the trees have started turning yellow.
Then after every episode, I had to go up to the bathtub and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain, because that's all there was to look at.
I needed to head towards conservation goals.
And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the 1960s and '70s, and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now.
It's a very deep-water part of our planet.
And they've been uninhabited for most of time because even in the ancient days, these islands were too far away from the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti for those ancient Polynesian mariners that were traversing the Pacific so widely.
So I thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever, but they did finally come to an end.
In the west we have the Gilbert Islands.
Because that's where all the ocean is."
So it's something we need to focus on.
And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area.
So if the United States removes a million dollars' worth of lobsters from a reef, Kiribati gets 50,000 dollars.
Many, many steps were taken to pull this off.
This picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago when we returned to the Phoenix Islands and discovered that, because it is a protected area and has healthy fish populations that keep the algae grazed down and keep the rest of the reef healthy, the coral is booming, is just booming back.
Kiribati has frozen extracting activities at its current state while we raise the endowment.
How do we realize Sylvia's dream?
And there's some evidence that they are.
I did some quick calculations. I took the last 20 years of GDP growth and the last 20 years of labor productivity growth and used those in a fairly straightforward way to try to project how many jobs the economy was going to need to keep growing, and this is the line that I came up with.
Not anymore. This is an article that appeared in Forbes online a while back about Apple's earnings.
And digital technologies are not just impacting knowledge work.
So when you do this, and when you plot the data, you pretty quickly come to some weird conclusions.
Economies don't run on energy. They don't run on capital, they don't run on labor. Economies run on ideas.
The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology.
So, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs, but focusing on that fact misses the point entirely.
And it turned out that -- I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.
What I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.
You know, of course, they are related to this combination of at least two of them being, you know, design objects.
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas.
Much, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness -- and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me.
I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.
People's demeanor changes when they go in there.
I think that was -- the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.
This is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.
So I just picked another one.
Then it's: "always works out."
Consider this: like the prophets, all the superheroes are missing parents.
But the Mongols get there first.
And now it's 2010, and there are 99 heroes from 99 different countries.
So these 99 stones, a few kind of rules in the game: Number one, you don't choose the stone; the stone chooses you.
Now the main bad guy, Rughal, does not want these stones to update, so he's trying to get them to stop updating.
There's this very strong social message that needs to get to kind of the deepest crevices of intolerance, and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game.
Now, Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer.
My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots.
And we entered Western consciousness with a tagline: "Next Ramadan, the world will have new heroes," back in 2005.
The good news is they're all holding copies of The 99, smiling, and they found me to sign the picture.
So if we can get the lights ...
Jabbar: Dana, I can't do this without you.
Dana: That way.
But that's only half the story.
And the first one was about a group called The Party of God, who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal.
In other words, good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way.
I said, "Go away. I'm working. I'm busy."
It feels like we're all suffering from information overload or data glut.
So purple is "fighting," and red is "giving money away," and green is "profiteering."
So now it's great because now we have this texture, and we can add numbers to it as well.
So I want to show you another landscape now.
The millennium bug, terrible disaster.
Why?
So, I've been working as a data journalist for about a year, and I keep hearing a phrase all the time, which is this: "Data is the new oil."
Can you guess what this data set is?
I started as a programmer, and then I worked as a writer for many years, about 20 years, in print, online and then in advertising, and only recently have I started designing.
There's something almost quite magical about visual information.
And that little square in the corner, a naught .7 percent, that's the amount we're actually aware of.
Let me ask you a simple question with a really simple answer: Who has the biggest military budget?
So its military budget is bound to be enormous.
But of course, China has an enormous population.
I'm a bit of a health nut.
Now this image constitutes a huge amount of work.
I like to apply information visualization to ideas and concepts.
So, just to wrap up, I wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions, and information design is about solving information problems.
We look at the data and we see: Yep, the volcano emitted 150,000 tons; the grounded planes would have emitted 345,000 if they were in the sky.
The Eden top note is named after the Eden Project in the U.K.
And perfumery shows you that can't be true, because if it were like that it wouldn't be an art, OK?
Once you figure this out, you can really impress people at parties.
Now, this is a totally insane idea.
He's making 45 molecules, and he's looking for a sandalwood, something that smells of sandalwood.
So this is the sound of the O-H stretch, translated into the audible range.
Now, after searching high and low for several months, I discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane which has exactly the same vibration.
Now, the slight fly in the ointment is this: that if we smell molecular vibrations, we must have a spectroscope in our nose.
Now, I could do the dance of electron tunneling, but I've done a video instead, which is much more interesting. Here's how it works.
But it has a certain -- -- it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people who read too much 19th-century German literature.
And the problem is it's a carcinogen.
And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin.
And: You're completely wrong, and I'm sure you're completely wrong.
It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could.
They're often called garage tinkerers, because some of them actually did some things in garages, even though that's partly a myth.
And the point is that the Internet was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.
They spend on the D part of R&amp;D.
Innovation takes a much longer time than that, 15 to 20 years.
What we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.
So what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations.
It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive.
But perhaps even more important, we heard before about the one percent, the 99 percent.
My focus is understanding you people, and how you interact with the government to get your benefits, how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with, and how you view brands.
And what about terms like "over the limit"?
Each year, one in 10 taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS.
We see all this complexity.
Margaret Thatcher was my mother.
It's our respect.
The adoptive parents were lined up.
Norman!
Who knew?
So this was an opportunity. If they were asking me whether I loved them or not, then I mustn't love them, which led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.
On the third children's home, at 15, I started to rebel, and what I did was, I got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models, and I was -- it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home -- and I was in a little turret at the top of it, and I poured them, red, yellow and green, the colors of Africa, down the tiles.
The man who ran it was an ex-army officer.
I'm just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is, a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, an aunt, an uncle, a cousin, a grandparent. It matters to someone, and therefore it matters to you. Understand, I was 14 years old, tucked away in myself, into myself, and I wasn't touched either, physically touched.
She said, "You know, they're like, really smart, talented -- " I said, "I know, I know."
Those of us in education have held on to a business plan that we don't care how many millions of young people fail, we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work, and nobody is getting crazy about it -- right? -- enough to say, "Enough is enough."
You know why? Because they didn't care.
Now look, I'm a technology fan, but I have to admit to you all I'm a little old.
You say, whoo! So I heard about that in '75 when I was at the Ed School at Harvard.
I never got that. I never got that, because anyone knows if you farm, you don't plant crops in July and August.
Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying, "Look, this works, right? We can do this."
With our first kids, we did not know the science about brain development.
We know it's important for kids.
You know why I provide kids with those health benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts?
You're going to go and teach this year.
You take me to any school.
The high stakes is today, because you can do something about it.
A lot of them don't. They should be closed.
Did anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul.
I don't know about a fiscal cliff, but I know there's an educational cliff that we are walking over right this very second, and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness about saying we can't afford this — So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars.
Thank you all very much. Thank you.
And so we've figured out that you've got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does.
I was the better at improvisation, You were the better at spinning the plates; I was the better at procrastination, You were the better at quiet debate.
I wrote this next poem for my mother.
But my mother has lived by this creed all her life.
Keep to the track, to the beaten track; Never return to the bridges you've burned.
You think we want you to do it, but we don't want you to do it.
Nothing good can come of this.
Do I shrink from thy caress?
All empires, by definition, are bumbling, shambolic, bullying, bureaucratic affairs, as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy, as they are corrupted by power in their dotage.
What of the Brand and the Label?
My rage at injustice waxed hot as the pits.
We feasted and reveled and rutted in muck, Forgetting our peril, forgetting to duck, Forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives.
I wasn't allowed to see any of my -- you know, whatever.
But it's interesting to me. I love to write historical verse.
We killed every single one of them.
And at seven o'clock every night, I took me some more girls, already corrupted.
I only stopped because I thought if I got caught, what would happen to my mother.
That is the big question.
And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.
It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people, to begin to piece together our past.
And it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother.
And then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you.
But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.
And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.
And what was so fun about it was this: the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree, and fairly recently the tree had grown up, but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside, and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this, holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.
I think it's our collective intelligence.
You can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.
We're sitting on the edge of a precipice, and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today.
The fact is, is that the British Museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century -- it was actually mummified, skin and all -- but in a fit of space-saving zeal, they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire.
Any time I have an internet connection, there's a sluice of stuff moving into there, everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.
It's exactly how I made my living for 15 years.
And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.
I don't have the room for this in my house, but I had to finish what I had started.
I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan, a New Jersey editor, actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in 1991, although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers' specifications, because there was a lot of controversy about it.
But again, I am not a sculptor, and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like, I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey; I certainly wasn't able to get it.
And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority at this point in time, when I'd finished it, of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few -- this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you, is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.
But there was a problem. And the problem was that: I wanted the entirety of the object, I wanted the weight behind the object.
like it is in the movie.
Yeah, no, really, this was like aah -- why didn't I remember this?
That's what defined me. That was my bliss.
I was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in Sydney.
I was at a crossroads.
They took out two of my broken ribs, and they rebuilt my back, L1, they rebuilt it, they took out another broken rib, they fused T12, L1 and L2 together.
And if you walk again, it will be with calipers and a walking frame."
I had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head and I saw my world through a mirror that was suspended above my head.
And even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward, there were moments of incredible depth and richness, of authenticity and connection that I had never experienced before.
In the spinal ward, that's normal.
I wanted my old life back. I wanted my body back.
She was always happy, and even when she began to talk again, albeit difficult to understand, she never complained, not once.
She passed me the phone book, I rang up the flying school, I made a booking, said I'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight.
Finally this guy comes out. He goes, "Hi, I'm Andrew, and I'm going to take you flying."
He went, "Oh."
Didn't know how on Earth I'd ever pass a medical.
And little goals kept me going along the way, and eventually I got my private pilot's license, and then I learned to navigate, and I flew my friends around Australia.
But then I knew for certain that although my body might be limited, it was my spirit that was unstoppable.
So raise your straws if you'll join me.
We respond so well to form, but I'm interested in creating intelligent form.
A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn, Tom Main, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas -- all these people that I think are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form.
It is more valuable than the product in my eyes. I don't have one.
It's a millefiori of ideas.
When I look at these things, they look pretty normal to me.
It's a weird, kind of freaky place.
Not a bad idea. I don't know. I need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that, but I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something, a car -- I don't know.
It shows how you make one holistic form, like the car industry, and then you break up what you need.
I don't -- and they look funky too -- but I don't set out to make funky things because I think that's an absolute disgrace.
Coral, all these natural forces, take away what they don't need and they deliver maximum beauty.
It takes away any material you don't need and it actually garners flexure too, so -- I was going to break into a dance then.
So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio.
I said, "You get into biopolymers." They looked straight through me.
They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this.
You see that thing. You do.
And that's what I do with my furniture.
Most people go and buy the Aston Martin. I built this.
So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video.
I'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers -- wankers.
No, it's true. It's true. People like Tom and Greg -- we're traveling like you can't -- we fit it all in. I don't know how we do it.
A copper jelly mold.
It was an evening dive.
This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows.
But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals by the type of flashes they produced.
And sometimes you can see it even closer than that, because the heads on ships -- that's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening -- are flushed with unfiltered seawater that often has bioluminescent plankton in it.
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure.
I do wish, with their budget, that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor, starving graduate student, who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that's been preserved in formalin.
So this little guy has found himself this babe, and you will note that he's had the good sense to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her.
This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light.
This is us chasing it in the submersible.
And I defy you to name any other branch of science that still depends on hundreds of year-old technology.
Made an intensified camera, wanted to make this electronic jellyfish.
And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once."

I said the electronics are open-source, because at the heart of this printer there is something I'm really attached to: these Arduino boards, the motherboard that sort of powers this printer, is a project I've been working on for the past seven years.
I have 11-year-old kids stop me and show me stuff they built for Arduino that's really scary to see the capabilities that kids have when you give them the tools.
You know, when I was learning about programming, I learned by looking at other people's code, or looking at other people's circuits in magazines.
So, this idea that you have a new, sort of turbo-charged DIY community that believes in open-source, in collaboration, collaborates online, collaborates in different spaces.
But then somebody actually launched this start-up called Matternet, where they figured out that you could use this to actually transport things from one village to another in Africa, and the fact that this was easy to find, open-source, easy to hack, enabled them to prototype their company really quickly.
Or it's used for — So this is a musical interface built by a student from Italy, and he's now turning this into a product. Because it was a student project becoming a product.
So, you know, this plant will start to say, "This is really hot," or there's a lot of, you know, "I need water right now."
What am I supposed to excite, huh?
But when you have this idea, you know, what happens to all these ideas?
So, as I said, there's lots of examples, and I'm going to stop here. And I just want to thank the Arduino community for being the best, and just every day making lots of projects.
My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us.
We are literally going to sleep our way to the top, literally.
does not mean that you're a good leader, because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic.
It was made of glass, and this building really helped me to do my job good.
Both are of the male sex.
As you probably know, in science, when you write a kind of special paper, only six or seven people read it.
And there are nine other winners who get prizes.
You can pass it around.
These are cane toads in Australia.
I mean, the question I ask myself, why does this happen in nature?
So what this bird does is fight his own image.
So I hope to see you next year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for Dead Duck Day.
So, for example, if I have, like — This is the sound of purple.
It's just fabulous.
Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed, because when I look at someone, I hear their face, so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.
The good thing about this is, if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.
So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color, for example, these are two very well-known speeches.
I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.
If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town, people will move there.
It was in a grizzly bear preserve, although no one told me that before we went.
You have to go in a school bus."
So, what do we do about it?
And yet, we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope, hoping that we can judge any dispute against the standard of a perfect society, where everyone will agree what's fair, and where accidents will be extinct, risk will be no more.
Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes, and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong.
You could have a separate section of a law library around each of the following legal concepts: due process, special education, no child left behind, zero tolerance, work rules ...
It's not that they usually sue, it's not that they would win, but it's an indication of the corrosion of authority.
I mean it's just absolutely a formula for failure.
And why not? They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law?
It actually changes the way people think.
Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else's freedom.
And there are two essential elements of it: We have to simplify the law.
As you're going down, and walking down the sidewalk during the day, you have to think that if there is a dispute, there's somebody in society who sees it as their job to affirmatively protect you if you're acting reasonably.
They're still bounded by legal goals and principles: The teacher is accountable to the principal, the judge is accountable to an appellate court, the president is accountable to voters.
If the environmental agency can't decide that the power lines are good for the environment, then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city.
Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them.
If things aren't going right, the first response is: let's make more rules, let's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing.
There's the Dodd-Frank Act, there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor by Elizabeth Warren.
So one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the Isle of Lesbos, and they need to measure out round columns.
The way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it, they are kind of like jazz musicians.
Together they comprise practical wisdom, which Aristotle thought was the master virtue.
It was a toy gun.
Spend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job.
Michael was sentenced to five years in prison.
So here was the consultant's advice: first, don't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do.
But the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity, and they demoralize professional activity in two senses.
So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow, and they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing.
He was only able to get part-time work because of his back, and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family.
It was a court only for veterans who had broken the law.
Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record.
Banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers.
Each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission -- what Aristotle would have called its proper telos.
Well, to love well and to work well, you need wisdom.
One of the big things about countering terrorism is, how do you perceive it?
The consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency.
Perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across.
Now, staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds, think about delivery mechanisms.
But whether it's victims, whether it's governments, NGOs, or even the Queen yesterday, in Northern Ireland, we have to interact and engage with those different layers of terrorism, and, in effect, we do have to have a little dance with the devil.
The father will probably kick himself for years to come that he didn't take that seat instead of his kid.
We do not look after our victims, and we do not enable them, and what I'm going to try and show is that actually, victims are the best weapon we have against more terrorism.
The fear and the pressure to do something on them is going to be immense. They are going to make mistakes.
We do have to see this as a deadly battlefield.
It was effective not just because justice was seen to be done where there was a huge void.
Civil affairs and civil society initiatives.
There's practical problems.
The role we could do right now is going away and looking at how we can support victims around the world to bring initiatives.
It's those Bulgakov themes, it's that picture of Jesus and the Devil hand in hand in Gethsemane walking into the moonlight.
The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the Manhattan Project, and the idea was very straightforward: we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror of this unending World War II that we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific.
We began to counter-proliferate, and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of 21,000.
We were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym, which is MAD.
Now, the bomb shelters at that point -- let's say you bought a prefab one -- it would be a few hundred dollars, maybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one.
And I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate, and actually have three or four days' warning.
Here's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit."
So I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second.
More than 100 megatons of this is stored in particularly insecure Russian facilities.
The second thing is, what about the know-how?
Well, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized.
What if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon?
There's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer.
So, first of all, this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine.
My point now, though, is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here, if you've survived the initial blast.
If you don't get out of there, you're going to be exposed to lethal radiation in very short order.
Part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves, personally, are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe.
So separation -- hopefully with dirt or concrete, or being in a basement -- distance and time is what will save you.
And finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible.
We've not been focused, we've not done what we had to do, and now we're facing the potential of bad, hell on Earth.
OK, I'm going to do another cut.
Let's say I'm going to cut the liver right here.
Let me zoom in.
And I can build muscles gradually, just like that.
So this is Anatomage Table. Thank you.
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly.
After this, they were scientists, professionals with a particular scientific method, goals, societies and funding.
They felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the 17th century.
In the days before pocket calculators, the numbers that most professionals needed -- bankers, insurance agents, ship captains, engineers — were to be found in lookup books like this, filled with tables of figures.
Tragically, Babbage's engines never were built in his day because most people thought that non-human computers would have no usefulness for the public.
Occasionally, there were prizes, such as that given to John Harrison in the 18th century, for solving the so-called longitude problem, but prizes were only given after the fact, when they were given at all.
and "What proportion of the Earth is covered in water?"
And I was thinking about quarks and gluons and heavy ion collisions, and I was only 14 years old.
And that came as a surprise to me, because I was actually hired to work on quantum computation.
And then I thought about it a little bit, and I said, "Well, is it really that easy?
It's actually not life, it's a crystal.
And that explains why that NASA manager was actually in my office to begin with.
In fact, they have hackers writing them.
I had two undergraduate students at California Institute of Technology that worked with me.
Any time there is a program that's better at surviving in this world, due to whatever mutation it has acquired, it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction.
And then you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation, like this one, which is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before, until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved.
As long as I know that there's some sort of alphabet.
As long as our books are written in English -- because people are rewriting them and recopying them -- it's going to be there.
That is also very robust -- what you find in systems like Earth where there are amino acids, but there is no life.
I can tell you indeed it is, because this type of spectrum, just like what you've seen in books, and just like what you've seen in amino acids, it doesn't really matter how you change the environment, it's very robust; it's going to reflect the environment.
So first, nothing, nothing, nothing.
What do we learn from that?
Now we don't know that there's life then, but we could say, "Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from."
The cop says, "Are you sure? Hey buddy, are you sure you lost your keys here?"
We don't know how many kids died last week in any of those countries.
Sometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this.
Truck after truck after truck filled with stack after stack after stack of data.
The top movie of the year was "Die Hard with a Vengeance."
So that's actually what I began to do.
There are schools that need to track attendance.
Then you had to find the money to pay for me to fly out to your country and the money to pay for my hotel and my per diem and my daily rate.
But the miracle that happened, I'm going to call it Hotmail for short.
They don't require any programmers.
Obviously nowadays, we've moved past Palm Pilots to mobile phones.
Cloud-based, no training, no consultants, no me.
So, you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown, you have the non-obvious, you have the non-seen, for the people who don't dare to go through the ice.
And as long as we fight horizontally, against life, against the winds, against what's happening to us, life is a nightmare.
Sand, water, all the equipment we don't need anymore.
Life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three dimensions.
I deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid -- if we throw overboard this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past.
So, we disobeyed. We flew much higher, and double the speed.
This is why you need people with long-term vision.
That's a crisis.
It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now.
Well, solar power airplanes are not new.
64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot, the batteries, flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency.
That has been achieved after two years of work.
And what's the goal now?
And 20 years later there were 200 people in every airplane crossing the Atlantic.
The success will not come if we "just," quote, unquote, fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane.
Everyone has his goal, has his dreams, has his visions.
You see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song, you needed a studio and a producer.
From the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged.
We lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage.
He knew, in Ireland, that his son would live, and that in Ethiopia, his son would die.
11 million AIDS orphans in Africa, 20 million by the end of the decade.
This is about justice. Really.
It makes a farce of our idea of equality.
We're standing around with watering cans, when what we really need is the fire brigade.
It's not spin. It's not wishful thinking.
The regional branch managers are getting nervous.
But that's just the easy part, or ought to be.
A whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this.
But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for.
So why, then, are we not pumping our fists into the air?
The Clash wore big army boots, not sandals.
There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself.
Give them permission, if you like, to spend their political capital and your financial capital, your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people.
But there's also our sense of ourselves.
The war against terror, yes.
Anyway, here's number one.
We can't afford to be cool and sit this one out.
Could be on Google, could be on AOL.
: One by one they step forward, a nurse, a teacher, a homemaker, and lives are saved.
We can make history.
But wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then.
But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words.
This is the mathematics of metaphor.
This might look familiar.
This is the Bouba/Kiki test.
Neckties are loud.
Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well.
Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news.
Whenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery, we compare what we know with what we don't know.
Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy: "Cogito ergo sum."
Pat Mitchell: You have brought us images from the Yemen Times.
I love this picture.
Is it going to be so many different countries?
N Well, let me first warn you that I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl.
And even my mother -- I owe it to my family.
And when I became editor-in-chief after my brother actually -- my father passed away in 1999, and then my brother until 2005 -- and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it.
But in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have, you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society and the one that you are now creating at the paper.
And I have done this throughout my work.
PM: But by putting yourself personally out there -- both projecting a different image of Yemeni women, but also what you have made possible for the women who work at the paper -- has this put you in personal danger?
We've created the credibility.
That thing.
You spoke about the responsibility of the press.
It's natural.
Crazy, I know. Insane.
My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for PH, but after six months, I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs.
If you run out of medicine, you definitely die.
And before long, I was commuting between Budapest, Milan and Florence.
I had to say goodbye in some way, shape or form.
I started mixing, and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another, but I just kept on going.
I knew another young man, though, who had PH who died while waiting for one.
I finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice.
But organs don't wait, and I went into surgery before I could say goodbye.
Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs, death happens.
And some of us might even sing.
And these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors.
Again, similar story around the world.
It turns out, atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world.
So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.
Now what's interesting is, of course, that we're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine, the number one contaminant in drinking water, that does the opposite -- turns on aromatase, increases estrogen and promotes tumors in rats and is associated with tumors, breast cancer, in humans.
And for those of you who are not parents, sippy cups are those little plastic things that your child graduates to after using bottles.
And as a result, when those rats grow up, their pups experience retarded growth and development because they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups.
Old man: Placenta control.
Today, I had some octyphenols, some artificial musks and some bisphenol A.
And that's something that's just profound and sad, but astonishing because so many of us don't actually know this.
Of course, most of them, 90 percent are Mexican, Mexican-American.
P So it doesn't take much to realize that actually this is an environmental issue.
Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.
Half of each year's 100 billion points of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash.
Sadly, their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface.
I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes, from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter.
We have to throw it away.
Charles Moore: Thank you.
And it's a very effective way of ending your hate mail: "Love Markham, Aged 4." Still works.
So the ground shook in Managua 60 seconds after it hit the epicenter.
So by the time I'm finished talking here, there'll be 864 more hours of video on Youtube than there were when I started, and two and a half million more photos on Facebook and Instagram than when I started.
It's like the de facto real-time newswire, if you know how to use it, because there is so much on Twitter.
These are the ones that are obviously making sense.
Markham Nolan: Okay, so now if you're a news producer, this is something you'd love to run with, because obviously, this is gold.
So we went to the white pages, and we found, we looked through the Rita Krills in the phonebook, and we looked through a couple of different addresses, and that took us to Google Maps, where we found a house.
And what this video shows, when you watch the whole thing through, is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck and thrown off a bridge.
We looked at the curbs. The curbs were throwing shadows south, so we could tell the bridge was running east-west across the river.
The bridge looks like it's crossing the river east to west.
Given a couple of clues, I could probably find out a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out.
The largest individuals of this species, the dreadnoughts of their kind, live just on the north coast of California, where the rain is really intense.
We're going to show you what the diameter at breast height of a big Redwood is.
It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast, and was discovered in 1998.
His friend, a guy named Marwood Harris, was following behind.
That's my son, Oliver.
And we practiced advanced techniques like sky-walking, where you can move from tree to tree through space, rather like Spiderman.
And all of a sudden, you lose sight of the ground, and you also lose sight of the sky, and you're in a three-dimensional labyrinth in the air filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil, which is populated with all kinds of small organisms.
Redwoods grow very slowly in their tops.
And this hallucinatory drawing shows you -- everything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar.
They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself.
Gaya may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old, no one really knows, but its top has broken off and it's been rotting back now.
I hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east, but in Great Smoky Mountains National Park it can rain up to 100 inches of rain a year.
We are human, and we have the capacity to love, we have the capacity to wonder, and we have a sort of boundless curiosity, a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates, I think.
And in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again, and so no specimens have ever been collected.
Richard Preston, thank you very much, I think.
We were passing by a bus stop.
He could have run from a block away.
We're not interested in your help." And he threw me out of the room.
He was on Coumadin.
So we have thousands of volunteers who are passionate about saving lives, and they're spread all around, so whenever a call comes in, they just stop everything and go and run and save a life.
You know, Israelis are good in technology.
They ask me to meet. They wanted to meet with me.
Settlers were saving Arabs and Arabs were saving settlers.
I never even knew what TEDMED was then.
And it's happening during our lifetimes.
Let's take a look.
So half a year ago, I decided to go to Pakistan myself.
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.
What we have here is a list of old viruses.
Today, they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers.
So where are all these coming from then?
Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals.
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage.
How do you actually track them down?
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.
I got zero hits; wasn't there.
Now that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg.
Well in most cases it never gets this far.
This is what runs everything around us.
And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us.
And if we can predict, then we can engineer the future.
We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics, we need to look at this in a rigorous way.
Mother Theresa, she was rational.
If we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States we would like to think, may have some influence -- certainly the president in Iran has some influence -- but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person doesn't know much about Iran, or about energy policy, or about health care, or about any particular policy.
Imagine for example that Sally over here, wants to know what Harry, and Jane, and George and Frank are thinking, and sends messages to those people.
No. How about 10 times?
That's not my claim, that's a CIA claim -- you can read it, it was declassified a while ago. You can read it in a volume edited by H. Bradford Westerfield, Yale University Press.
They're careerists, they also care about getting credit -- there's ego involvement, they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome, or as important, if it's their druthers, to block an outcome.
I want to be very clear here. I'm not projecting some past data into the future.
The yellow line shows us the most likely path.
Out here today, there are a bunch of people -- Ahmadinejad for example -- who would like not only to build a bomb, but test a bomb.
Two things to notice: he's getting weaker, and while he gets a lot of attention in the United States, he is not a major player in Iran.
That was fascinating.
BBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want, and we could get there a lot sooner, and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions, and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end, and the world would be a better place.
A fan saw it on TV, recorded it with her camera phone, and uploaded it to YouTube.
And that's over 20 hours of video every minute.
So Sony is generating revenue from both of these.
It's not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners.
By simply blocking all reuse, you'll miss out on new art forms, new audiences, new distribution channels and new revenue streams.
We're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides.
[Hawaiian chant] When they finish, they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them.
And it will take all of you.
He's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world.
Now science may dismiss this methodology, but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel.
I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains.
It always was.
And the bottom line of why I'm here, besides being a crazy mofo, is that I'm really in a position -- I'm not here to motivate you, obviously; you don't need that.
I don't know about another category, but we all know how to think.
What makes the difference in their performance?"
That's "How do you take the invisible and make it visible," right?
And then you meet people that have been through ultimate pain -- psychologically, sexually, spiritually, emotionally abused -- and not always, but often, they become some of the people that contribute the most to society.
How many have ever failed to achieve something significant in your life? Say, "Aye."
If you're creative enough, playful enough, fun enough, can you get through to anybody? Yes or no?
In this second, consciously or unconsciously, the minute you decide to focus on something you've got to give it a meaning, and whatever that meaning is produces emotion.
The history of our world is these decisions.
What shapes you? Two invisible forces. Very quickly. One: state.
When we want to influence somebody, we've got to know what already influences them.
And then there's the fuel you pick. So very quickly, six needs.
We need variety. We need surprise.
Whatever it takes. The fastest way to do this, if you have no background, no culture, no belief and resources or resourcefulness, is violence. If I put a gun to your head and I live in the 'hood, instantly I'm significant.
Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves.
I don't even know who it is." My father always said, "No one gives a shit." And all of a sudden, somebody I don't know, they're not asking for anything, they're just giving our family food, looking out for us. It made me believe this: "What does it mean that strangers care?" And what that made me decide is, if strangers care about me and my family, I care about them.
So, I don't tell you that to brag; I tell you because I'm proud of human beings, because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance to experience it, not talk about it.
Now, here's what I'll tell you about emotion. There are 6,000 emotions that we all have words for in the English language, which is just a linguistic representation, right, that changes by language. But if your dominant emotions -- if I had more time, I have 20,000 people or 1,000, and I have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week, and I gave them as long as they needed, and on one side they write empowering emotions, the other's disempowering -- guess how many emotions people experience? Less than 12.
She said, "It's over." When I finished that night, she called him and left a message -- true story -- at the top of the World Trade Center where he worked, saying, "Honey, I love you, I just want you to know I want to marry you. It was stupid of me." She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m. for us, when he called her back from the top and said, "Honey, I can't tell you what this means."
What does this mean and what are we going to do?"
I've been playing TED for nearly a decade, and I've very rarely played any new songs of my own.
It's about Billie Holiday.
Since the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art, writing poems, singing songs, scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper, gossiping with friends. This is nothing new.
It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.
And then they also exhibit curiosity.
"I feel so free; I feel so good."
The next movement is called mobs.
Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.
We see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad."
"I feel invisible to you."
There's One World, which presents the spinning globe, and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one.
And as an adult, I've been more aware of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.
Nobody's seen this yet, publicly.
We see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.
President Ford -- this is Gerald Ford's funeral.
But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.
You can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source. This one's from Al Jazeera.
So we see again, climate change is large: Nairobi, global conference, environmental.
It seems like they're everyone's default doom-and-gloom metaphor.
Aristophanes, the ancient Greek playwright, he described the clouds as the patron godesses of idle fellows two and a half thousand years ago, and you can see what he means.
Perhaps you're having a moment of existential angst.
And the society exists to remind people of this: Clouds are not something to moan about.
It's like a bit of everyday meditation.
All right. Those are rarer clouds than the cirrus, but they're not that rare.
These clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere.
If you close your eyes and think of a cloud, it's probably one of these that comes to mind.
It takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine.
If you translate that to phone books, it's about one meter of phone books in the pile.
They would put up 25,000 images, they would go like this, "25,0000, okay, okay.
So transforming the data set into something that looks like this.
She's playing a computer game.
That machine is, today, about as fast as my iPhone.
That's where those artifacts are coming from.
So again, looking at very, very large data sets, and you saw those full-body scans that we can do.
Here's another case, a knifing.
So it really, really helps the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death, and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was.
So if you were thinking of buying an iPad, forget about it. This is what you want instead.
So what you're seeing on the left is a touch device.
So this is really nice.
I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient's heart before you actually do surgery, and do that with high-quality resolution data.
So he could actually see things in the goggles.
So he's going "100, 97, 94."
I can peel off the layer of the lion.
And here it is. Here is the nose of the bear.
Because, basically, I work as a theoretical physicist.
We had an amazing childhood. We didn't have any money, but we were outdoors most of the time.
I used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible, to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world.
I counted the number of bricks and now I'm multiplying."
And I went to Cambridge. And there, I fell for theoretical physics.
What banged?"
Which is, what happens if these two, three-dimensional worlds should actually collide?
Furthermore, there's an experimental way to tell this theory, apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before.
That's progress: when we prove things wrong.
By the way, Africa is very large.
Here's the number of people in higher education.
And if you don't have math, you're not going to enter the modern age.
The area was kind of seedy, so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars.
And so when word came out that AIMS was opening, it spread very quickly via e-mail and our website.
Five students can be educated at AIMS for the cost of educating one in the U.S. or Europe.
And I'll just show you one.
After that, I came to the Netherlands where I'm now doing a Ph.D. in theoretical immunology.
Shehu: And from there we will be able to, hopefully, make better predictions and then we compare it to the graph and also make some predictions.
But she wants to continue in physics, and she's doing extremely well.
AIMS is now a proven model.
And each of these centers has a strong local team, each is in a beautiful place, an interesting place, which international lecturers will be happy to visit.
Because we want Africa to be rich.
This is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world.
He studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned.
Let's just take a look about how the brain works, and then I'll compare that with how computers work.
It's really a network in the literal sense of the word.
The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor.
And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.
In fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way.
So, we are at the stage where we don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices.
They want to compress the information -- they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on -- and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve, to send to the rest of the brain.
The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.
It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background, only on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.
So those are very important for catching somebody who's trying to sneak up on you.
I don't think that I would've had that reaction, if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction, hearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just -- you know, buying into this hype about computers.
Because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it, not even light, so you can't see it directly.
But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe, and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe.
At that point, what's going to happen?
So, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is, as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.
And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.
It's way more energetic.
And if there is a supermassive black hole, what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.
So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume?
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.
Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream, the stream is continuously moving and turbulent, and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.
So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.
And because of that, we've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there.
And the fun phase of this experiment is, while we've tested some of our ideas about the consequences of a supermassive black hole being at the center of our galaxy, almost every single one has been inconsistent with what we actually see.
And what does the big black hole do?
There is a dearth of old stars.
And on a much longer time scale, what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes, because, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.
And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast, and holds a lot in store for the future.
But he was tough when it came to music.
And he watched the ball fly for a second, and then he went, "Dah dadaratatatah.
And whether we call them 440 per second, A, or 3,729, B flat -- trust me, that's right -- they're just phenomena.
In 200 B.C., a man named Sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the Greeks.
Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move, but a composer is considering all possible moves, testing them out, prioritizing them out, until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness.
This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known.
But what's the actual difference between these two chords?
And the effects of technology began to be felt also, because printing put music, the scores, the codebooks of music, into the hands of performers everywhere.
Where does it go? What's left?
It spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing.
That's what drives my interest in projects like the TV series "Keeping Score" with the San Francisco Symphony that looks at the backstories of music, and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education.
Follow traces. Get lost. Be surprised, amused inspired.
So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights.
And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco, wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the Journal of Energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity.
As you can tell, you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours.
Well, this paper plane would be maybe a -- oop!
By 1945, they were making 100,000.
I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me.
So, for inspiration I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers.
Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect, I guess?
I have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet, and I'd like someone to come up here and choose five -- anyone to come up here and choose five -- and then I can make it into some sort of melody and I'll improvise it.
GH: OK. C, G, B, A and E.
I mean, it's quite brutal.
He's doing tricks here, dance tricks, that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before.
And at TED here in February, their passion and brilliance just took our breath away.
You can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel.
And amazingly, you can still see what the best can do, because the crowd itself shines a light on them, either directly, through comments, ratings, email, Facebook, Twitter, or indirectly, through numbers of views, through links that point Google there.
It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire, but the light and desire are a lethal one-two combination that attract new people to the crowd.
So, at TED, we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness.
I mean, it's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups.
This is the technology that's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally, thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd-accelerated innovation.
Here, let me introduce you to Sam Haber.
Jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer-reviewed research on video.
All those ideas are already out there in print.
So, that primal medium, which your brain is exquisitely wired for ...
Thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and, crucially, to respond, completing the cycle.
Schools can't be silos.
You're part of the crowd that may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history, a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter, wiser, more beautiful place.
They turned a trash place into a garden.
You know what?
Could you create the ultimate TEDTalk?
How should you deliver your talk?
Color plays a very important role.
Or are you going to go with a black version, which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks, mostly about blogs, politics and stuff?
But before I do that, let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible.
It's in its early stages, and it's crude by some measures, but in fact, 20 years ago, we were at nothing.
Well, you can't compare oranges to windshields.
More than two thirds of them had college degrees.
You can cover up one of her eyes, and you can still read something in the other eye, and I see sort of curiosity in one eye, I see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other.
It engages deep systems in our brain, in dopaminergic systems that are there to make you chase sex, food and salt.
Then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back, and you have to do something that is interesting, which is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay.
So we realized we could exploit this, and in fact, as we've done that, and we've done this now in many thousands of people, I think on the order of five or six thousand. We actually, to make this a biological probe, need bigger numbers than that, remarkably so. But anyway, patterns have emerged, and we've been able to take those patterns, convert them into mathematical models, and use those mathematical models to gain new insights into these exchanges. Okay, so what?
We think there's a future to this. But it's our way of going in and redefining, with a new lexicon, a mathematical one actually, as opposed to the standard ways that we think about mental illness, characterizing these diseases, by using the people as birds in the exchanges. That is, we exploit the fact that the healthy partner, playing somebody with major depression, or playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder, or playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, we use that as a kind of biosensor, and then we use computer programs to model that person, and it gives us a kind of assay of this.
Thanks for having me.
We have vast budget deficits.
Of course we don't.
Local power, central power, now, people power.
Suddenly, all sorts of transport, travel information were possible, and this gave birth to, what I like to call, the bureaucratic age.
Think of the huge change that means: Any business that wants to bid for a government contract can see what currently is being spent.
It is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago.
We want to get people to be more energy efficient.
We all know we need to recycle more.
It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate.
That's how we improve.
The system we have today isn't fair to them.
Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve?
We also had students fill out surveys with questions like, "Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson?"
A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays.
It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on.
I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about.
For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom.
It would also make us a more fair and just one, too.
I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it.
It's a nonprofit, a community biotech lab in Brooklyn, New York, and the idea was people could come, they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open, friendly atmosphere.
We make things glow.
You know, if you're working with a pathogen, you're not part of the biohacker community, you're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry.
Now, you might be asking yourself, "Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?"
And the same kind of technology -- it's called DNA barcoding, it's really cool -- You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga, if that sushi is really tuna, or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat's.
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science.
Once upon a time -- well actually less than two years ago -- in a kingdom not so very far away, there was a man who traveled many miles to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown -- an internationally famous company.
And yet, a couple of weeks later, he was picked up and taken to prison where he was subjected to a medical exam, including a full-body search in full view of the others in the cell.
People are less likely to come forth to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition, none of which helps these individuals or the communities these laws purport to protect.
These laws fly in the face of science, and they are grounded in prejudice and in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition and a selective reading of religion.
And so that's just programmed into you.
I took the test and the result showed I was positive.
SE: Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom are among the 34 million people living with HIV according to recent estimates.
In some parts of the world -- like here in the Middle East and North Africa -- new infections are rising and so are deaths.
But some countries take a harder line on this than others.
Thailand and Russia, however, have resisted harm reduction and have stringent laws which punish drug use.
Repealing a law isn't easy, and it's particularly difficult when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex.
In fact, if you fly over Germany, for example, and you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages, they're all about a mile apart.
Learning took place in schools. Health care took place in hospitals.
In China alone, 300 million people, some say 400 million people, will move to the city over the next 15 years.
First of all, work is becoming distributed and mobile.
How can we have the good stuff without the bad?
So we said, let's start with that neighborhood cell.
This is Boulder. It's a great example of kind of a mobility parkway, a superhighway for joggers and bicyclists where you can go from one end of the city to the other without crossing the street, and they also have bike-sharing, which I'll get into in a minute.
These are some of the vehicles that we've been working on.
You can dial in 40 calories going into work and 500 going home, when you can take a shower.
You have a dinner party. The table folds out to fit 16 people in otherwise a conventional one-bedroom, or maybe you want a dance studio.
That means twice as much parking, though.
We don't really believe in cameras to do things in homes.
Maybe a third — And you see everybody has their back to the wall and they have food and coffee down the way and they're in their own little personal bubble.
They grow 10 meters long.
This is an old woodcut from the 17, 1800s.
This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language.
There's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout the world.
And most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface.
And we were very effective.
So what they do is they store the data.
Christmas day it was out on the shelf edge.
One thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks are.
Before 2006, we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks.
You're thinking, "That's just ridiculous. No way."
The problem with this is they were constrained with samples.
They even put a recipe up on the wall, until they were told this was illegal.
Now we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable.
And I said, "You might try that."
And I thought, "Hey, you know, I can build on this."
And here it is.
And one thing that is kind of very useful is that we use a pole cameras -- this is my colleague Joanne with a pole camera -- where you can actually look underneath the shark.
I am sorry I cannot show you my face, because if I do, the bad guys will come for me.
It was fantastic.
They got themselves ready.
Their bodies are chopped up with machetes and are supposed to be used for some concoctions or some potions for people to get money -- or so many, many stories people would tell about it.
My kind of journalism is a product of my society.
I've never stepped there before.
Sometimes these are some of the headlines that come.
How can you obtain the hard core evidence?
This will not stop.
Talk to me just about fear and how you manage that, because you're regularly putting your life at risk.
And we're appreciative. We salute you. Thank you so much, Anas.
Have you ever been divorced?
can feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it.
So when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy.
I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him.
If my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy, they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty.
I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen.
Obviously I couldn't get 20 million people to the same dinner party, so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice, without any lighting, or without any manipulation of any kind on my part.
And then we made this.
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage.
Almost 85,000 people watched that video, and then they started emailing us from all over the country, asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces.
Of course, in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight, but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian.
People didn't know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before.
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one.
Thank you.
And more importantly, that line between good and evil -- which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable, with them on the good side, and the others on the bad side -- I knew that line was movable, and it was permeable.
And apparently, he disobeyed God, and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority.
A few years ago -- I am sure all of you were shocked, as I was, with the revelation of American soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war, Abu Ghraib in Iraq.
I had access to him. I could study him, have him come to my home, get to know him, do psychological analysis to see, was he a good apple or bad apple.
It was the interrogation hold. The CIA was there.
In any event, here's former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.
Who are the cast of characters? What's the costume?
There's a study some of you think you know about, but very few people have ever read the story. You watched the movie.
We want men between 20 and 50."
The first button is 15 volts. He doesn't even feel it."
You should notice here, when it gets up to 375, it says, "Danger. Severe Shock."
And it's like a dial on human nature.
So this study, which I did with my graduate students, especially Craig Haney -- we also began work with an ad.
Student: A police car pulls up in front, and a cop comes to the front door, and knocks, and says he's looking for me.
Philip Zimbardo: Here are the prisoners who are going to be dehumanized.
The key is in the red zone.
Your habitual response patterns don't work.
If you give people power without oversight, it's a prescription for abuse. They knew that, and let that happen.
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says, "The line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being."
They organize their whole life around this.
I didn't know it was out of control. I was totally indifferent.
So the psychology of heroism is -- we're going to end in a moment -- how do we encourage children in new hero courses, that I'm working with Matt Langdon -- he has a hero workshop -- to develop this heroic imagination, this self-labeling, "I am a hero in waiting," and teach them skills.
The subway train is coming. There's 75 people there.
Let's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad, and let's focus on the positive.
But he also forgot that without consciousness, he would have no access to true happiness and even the possibility of transcendence.
This is not a person that is being studied at autopsy.
Well first of all, it is a mind, which is a flow of mental images.
So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it.
So if I cover my left eye -- I'm talking about me personally, not all of you -- if I cover my left eye, I look at the grid -- pretty much like the one I'm showing you.
And it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below.
So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the brain is.
I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day.
What happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self, you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence, and, in fact, there can be images going on, being formed in the cerebral cortex, except you don't know they're there.
I promise not to say anything about this, except this is to frighten you.
You cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem.
It's the autobiographical self which some species have, I think.
And this is, of course, the culture where we have developed something that I like to call socio-cultural regulation.
Think of strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious.
I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy.
Now I tell you this -- I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself, because I think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics, that beauty, that fun do matter.
My mom says, "Protest march."
So we're able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way.
These are three words many of us were raised with.
I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy -- kind of a dark fantasy -- of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the White House steps.
I wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson, the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists, who's dedicating her life to environmental justice.
Cornel West says, "Of course it's a failure.
And surely, at three and four years old, I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice, but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work.
I take it from this little dictum, "Know thyself."
But on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind, what are we really achieving?
Can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self-awareness that we seek?
It's the direct signal being recorded from my head, rendered in real time.
And the more focused my brain is, the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy.
We were making things activate, light up and work just by thinking.
And that was responsiveness.
We could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible and come to see things that were previously hidden.
So you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop.
We can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us, what once mystified and separated us.
With humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles.
Two millennia ago, those Greeks had some powerful insights.
To me, thought-controlled computing is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush -- one more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us.
And on my seventeenth birthday, I accompanied my little sister in complete innocence, as I always had all my life -- my visually impaired sister -- to go to see an eye specialist.
I am, and have been since birth, legally blind.
Hey.
And with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since I was such a child -- he taught me how to sail, knowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore, and I couldn't see the sails, and I couldn't see the destination.
And you know, disabled people are hugely educated.
I was 28 years old.
Can I tell you, airports are a disaster.
And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR, they sent me off to an eye specialist.
I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture."
I think it's time to stop fighting and do something different."
I always run it perfectly fine.
Do something different. What do you want to be?
But you can't tell me, no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what?
And I had no idea how I was going to be an elephant handler.
Because I wasn't believing in me, really me, all the bits of me -- all the bits of all of us.
But I wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible.
Even though I present confident, I was scared.
I no longer want anybody to be invisible.
Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever.
I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid.
And it made it doubly ironic -- my computer background -- a few years later, I think 2009 or so, when I got another phone call from "Jeopardy" saying, "It's early days yet, but IBM tells us they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.' Are you up for this?"
I was not going to say no.
It was a scatter chart showing performance on "Jeopardy," tens of thousands of dots representing "Jeopardy" champions up at the top with their performance plotted on number of -- I was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess, clues responded to -- versus the accuracy of those answers.
And I realized, this is it.
And so Watson does not travel.
I don't want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR, but Watson won handily.
And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals because there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions.
Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less?
There's just too much.
If, on the other hand, we need to look them all up, we may be in trouble.
And they say, "What do you mean? We just got here."
It's a meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge.
The great 18th-century British theologian and thinker, friend of Dr. Johnson, Samuel Parr once said, "It's always better to know a thing than not to know it."
Things always go terribly wrong.
We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us.
What we have is exactly the same thing, the same activity, but one of them makes you feel great and the other one, with just a small change of posture, makes you feel terrible.
And that's because having a son who's unemployed in Manchester is really quite embarrassing, but having a son who's unemployed in Thailand is really viewed as quite an accomplishment.
The circumstances of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness than the sense of control we feel over our lives.
Do you call it the bailout of Greece or the bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to Greece?
We didn't have a framework.
Why were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically?
Because the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality, its duration, but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait.
The accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights; it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights.
Give them 18 white pills and six blue ones and tell them to take the white pills first and then take the blue ones.
Time means more to some people than others.
It could revolutionize the public services.
But as Charlie Munger says, "If economics isn't behavioral, I don't know what the hell is."
If however, you bought some wool from the shepherd and charged a premium for converting it into a hat, you weren't actually creating value, you were exploiting the shepherd.
They decided this wasn't good enough and they wanted to get it up to 99.
Choose your frame of reference and the perceived value and therefore the actual value is completely tranformed.
I don't just mean through reported pain reduction, actual measured pain reduction.
The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America because we don't have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures.
So how is that being accomplished here?
Public space. This is a good public space.
But this is how we do it in the United States.
This, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building, because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.
And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings, and the renderings, and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and -- I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there?
Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs, you know, apartments, offices, and so on.
And that's how we do it.
Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now.
But we know what's going on in these houses, you know.
Notice that nature is present.
We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live.
We can see some of the first ideas for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America.
We're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels.
One final thing -- I've been very disturbed about this for years, but I think it's particularly important for this audience.
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards, just like this.
This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side.
And I should also mention that, just like today, at that PostSecret event, I was using a wireless microphone.
I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog two years ago on Valentine's Day.
And just like every Sunday, we started reading the secrets out loud to each other."
"I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer.
Matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture.
When I posted this secret, dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones, sometimes ones they'd been keeping for years, messages from family or friends who had died.
Thank you.
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever.
Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation.
Hi. So, this chap here, he thinks he can tell you the future.
It also happens in, for example, cancer research.
Another 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill with no active ingredient, and only one of them died.
There are academic journals like "Trials," the open access journal, which will publish any trial conducted in humans regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result.
The classic model is, you get a bunch of studies where you know that they've been conducted and completed, and then you go and see if they've been published anywhere in the academic literature. So this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA.
Publication bias affects every field of medicine.
We've had people pretend that this is a problem that's been fixed.
And this is not a difficult problem to fix.
What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe, as we see.
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see.
for the Cassini mission.
This is Nepal.
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.
So, we've made a whole series of instruments.
Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones, you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror, or can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities.
They're manipulating each other's rhythms.
So, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment, actually into a series of books.
Even though they're cubes, they actually have a lot of personality.
And, if you're going to make a personal opera, what about a personal instrument?
Tod Machover: And we're really excited to have you here, really Dan.
So, the process and the technology -- basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know, we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer.
Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know, with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform.
Yeah.
And I'd like to think if this was the case, they probably would have rehearsed it a few times.
All right, untie me now and we'll get some dinner."
Hilarity ensues.
This is Odysseus as an old man who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife Penelope outside of Ithaca -- the other one.
It has these strong, heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth.
So when I was a starving post-doc at Columbia University, I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career.
But then I was like, that's more bad than writing is good, and so that wouldn't work.
I'm talking about the topic of saving.
There's a philosopher, Derek Parfit, who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I.
Each outcome is shown by one of these markers, and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement.
Yes, this person retired at 150 percent of their working income in retirement.
And as you get to the very bottom, you're faced with the unfortunate reality that if you don't save anything for retirement, you won't be able to afford any housing at all.
You can see his current annual income -- this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today -- is quite high, 91 percent, but his retirement income is quite low.
The younger face gets happier and happier, saving nothing.
And that's something that's easy to forget.
And al-jebr roughly translates to "the system for reconciling disparate parts."
This is the letter SHeen, and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- "sh."
Why is it that X is the unknown?
In the developing countries of the world, this gap is even larger.
The World Health Organization estimates that there are nearly four to five hundred million people living on our tiny planet who are affected by a mental illness.
Now I trained in medicine in India, and after that I chose psychiatry as my specialty, much to the dismay of my mother and all my family members who kind of thought neurosurgery would be a more respectable option for their brilliant son.
It became quickly apparent to me that I couldn't follow the sorts of mental health care models that I had been trained in, one that relied heavily on specialized, expensive mental health professionals to provide mental health care in countries like India and Zimbabwe.
What SUNDAR stands for, in Hindi, is "attractive."
But we need to do something about this problem.
And yet, we began.
Because the northeastern trade winds, as they go over the Amazonas, effectively gather the water vapor.
No matter what level you look at, whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level, we see the same problem again and again.
They were the ones that didn't get paid.
And you can't really have a proper model for development if at the same time you're destroying or allowing the degradation of the very asset, the most important asset, which is your development asset, that is ecological infrastructure.
See that again.
But on the other hand, if you start measuring, how much would it actually cost to restore the land of the shrimp farm back to productive use?
In fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase.
And actually we've done this with the TEEB project.
The way to do this is to do it on a company basis, to take leadership forward, and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost, and to disclose these answers.
If more companies did this, and if more sectors engaged this as sectors, you could have analysts, business analysts, and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs actually look and compare the social performance of companies.
It's about energy emissions.
And finally, there's deforestation, and there's emission of methane from agriculture.
These red dots, these red areas, basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people.
I decided when I was asked to do this that what I really wanted to talk about was my friend Richard Feynman.
He always made me feel smart.
I remember once he told me a story about a joke that the students played on him.
He told me this story, and he was really happy and laughing.
Their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness.
It's a scientific question after all.
They were so happy.
I don't think he was right.
The reason he called me Leonardo is because we were in Europe and he was practicing his French.
There went that theory down the trashcan of history.
But no doubt part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could.
And unfortunately, the helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other.
He wrote down a simple thing.
This was more or less known.
People were trying to do them.
What do you see?
I think he would have said, "I don't need this."
There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together, where you can change materials and shapes.
Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.
They came to me and said, "Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?
And there it is, that's the Bambi 16.
So, you know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations.
And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress.
These are the three working elements of fire that you have to have to have a good controlled fire.
These are Inuit children cutting whale blubber.
So these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people and you can understand them.
For those of you who aren't comfortable actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child.
I think that's it. That's number five and a half. OK.
We've invaded every country we've encountered.
If we halved that number, one estimate is it would create a net gain to the U.S. economy over 10 years of nearly a trillion dollars.
There are three principles on which human life flourishes, and they are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure.
You would never confuse them, would you?
ADHD. I'm not saying there's no such thing.
Great teachers do that, but what great teachers also do is mentor, stimulate, provoke, engage.
There he is. He's dieting. Is he losing any weight? Not really.
You know, I want to know what my cholesterol level is compared to everybody else's on a standard scale.
It's the common currency of being a human being.
We all create our own lives through this restless process of imagining alternatives and possibilities, and what one of the roles of education is to awaken and develop these powers of creativity.
I mean, there's a bit, but it's not what gets people up in the morning.
I mean, I've been to some states in America and I was the only person there.
And the third is, they devolve responsibility to the school level for getting the job done.
They have certain common features.
Culture is an organic term, isn't it?
It's dormant.
And there are people who move, people who make things happen."
So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me.
This is the field of biologic replacements, where we replace worn-out parts with new, natural ones.
And it works, not just for my wife, but certainly for other patients.
So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people, we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope.
We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts.
It's not software.
The space age began 50 years ago in October, and that's exactly what Sputnik looked like.
You see, the book was not driven by reading.
And when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print indulgences, which was the equivalent of printing money.
This is the Library of Human Imagination.
Everybody should have one, OK?
It's all about connections.
But I brought along here a lump of coal -- right here, one lump of coal.
I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true: I went in in 1956, came out in 1959, was working at the University of Washington, and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article, for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm.
And I say, What is the light bulb good for?
Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone, it's pretty much every direction.
The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool?
I'm not at all against education.
Now, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed, because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound.
I have been really lucky with this technology: all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.
Now, the question is, where's the sound made?
So, we've been, as I say, very successful, very lucky, in having companies catch the vision of this, from cars -- car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids, and a separate system in the back -- oh, no, the kids aren't driving today.
And so, another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't.
We've got a problem with the antenna ringing.
I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer in my attic at my house, and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design I drew way back when.
Get the cameraman.
This means that the robot is inherently unstable.
Due to his instability, Rezero is always in motion. Now here's the trick.
Due to the Ballbot system, it has a very small footprint and it's also easy to move around.
Okay, in this presentation, I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains through a fairly serious workout.
Now, this is heresy in the design world.
The things that interest me when I'm working are visual structure, surprise and anything that requires figuring things out.
So here's the word puzzle again.
And this project began essentially on my kitchen table.
Okay, well, it's what I can do with some household tinfoil.
When we look at works like this, we tend to associate them with children's literature.
Last year, I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine.
Just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile, and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing.
So I solicited friends to send me their used Christmas cards, and I made 500 of these.
What makes something worthwhile for me is the people I work for or with, the conditions I work under and the audience that I'm able to reach.
So a piece of mine may inspire a playwright or a novelist or a scientist, and that in turn may be the seed that inspires a doctor or a philanthropist or a babysitter.
Yet, it's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart.
And so, going back to this abalone shell, besides being nano-structured, one thing that's fascinating, is when a male and a female abalone get together, they pass on the genetic information that says, "This is how to build an exquisite material.
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox, so that they can build a structure that will be important to me?
It has the chemical sequences of amino acids, which says, "This is how to build the structure.
So I stayed up at night, and I talked to my husband, "How do I give President Obama a periodic table?
"I have this great project -- 50 million years."
So basically, viruses can't replicate themselves; they need a host.
And that battery went to the White House for a press conference.
And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels.
And what we've found is through genetic engineering, we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems.
At least good work, hopefully, at least it's good work -- hopefully great work.
But businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office, and they're making people go to it all the time, yet people don't do work in the office.
I mean, we've all been through this.
I didn't actually get meaningful work done.
And this is why people choose to do work at home, or they might go to the office, but they might go to the office really early in the day, or late at night when no one's around, or they stick around after everyone's left, or they go in on the weekends, or they get work done on the plane, or they get work done in the car or in the train because there are no distractions.
So you have to go back a few phases and start again.
So what are these interruptions that happen at the office that don't happen at other places?
They'll watch TV. They'll do this other thing."
I mean, is this China? What the hell is going on here?
And meetings are just toxic, terrible, poisonous things during the day at work.
So they go into a meeting room, they get together, and they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter usually.
You don't schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook.
I have three suggestions I'll share with you guys.
This is when people actually get stuff done, is when no one's bothering them, when no one's interrupting them.
Now some people might say email is really distracting and I.M. is really distracting, and these other things are really distracting, but they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing.
Just don't have it.
I live and work from Tokyo, Japan.
I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses.
OK, it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask.
And what I mean by that is, you know, you can transcend space by simply making a voice call, right?
We're human, that's what we do. It's one of our features.
And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.
You can't ask someone to do that on your behalf.
And the fact is that millions of people do it.
I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner.
They'll give you a new one.
There are training institutes where they're churning out people for fixing these things as well.
But I look at something like this, and I consider the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process.
Your notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK, for those extra three billion people.
OK, the title of this presentation is "Connections and Consequences," and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner, right?
And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate.
What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things: one, the rise of a culture of availability; and two, a request.
Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him.
So, as we lose the context of our identity, it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative, becomes the context in which we live.
When you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more, your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.
Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle, so you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much.
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services, showing that nicotine, which constricts your arteries, can cause a heart attack or a stroke, but it also causes impotence.
So that's Johnny Depp, of course.
I got my tattoo when I was 29, and I regretted it instantly.
And okay, I wouldn't change it.
So if, in fact, you want to live a life free of regret, there is an option open to you.
This session today is about behavioral economics.
Others very high on our list of regrets include career, romance, parenting, various decisions and choices about our sense of self and how we spend our leisure time -- or actually more specifically, how we fail to spend our leisure time.
But it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways.
The second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment.
Now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop.
The whole point of acts of idiocy is that they leave you totally uninsured; they leave you exposed to the world and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility in face of, frankly, a fairly indifferent universe.
So for instance, here's one of my favorite automatic generators of regret in modern life.
So how are we supposed to live with this?
I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something.
And when I came and settled in New York afterward, I was worried that I would forget some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time.
The point is to not hate ourselves for having them.
The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent.
Into this mix, people like us, who are not in public office, have more power to do good than at any time in history, because more than half the world's people live under governments they voted in and can vote out.
There are now a couple of hundred thousand.
The first country we went to work in, the Bahamas, was paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs.
Children's medicine was 600 dollars, because nobody could afford to buy any of it.
It has been my experience in working in developing countries that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say, well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption -- I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption, and feeds corruption.
And the absence of systems that function break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight.
And so we have set about doing that.
Our business plan in Rwanda was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble, who is an unusually gifted woman, but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work.
Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses -- again, all preventable and treatable.
About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it -- in just 18 months, up from zero when we started.
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses, health administration and community health workers throughout the country, to set up the information technology, the solar energy, the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure.
We have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help.
We decided to give back locally.
The people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials.
We pay the bill at the end of the month, but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren.
And you know what these are.
We had to replace them with recyclable plastic.
In August I'm bringing my sons."
There are no sidewalks.
We made space for these guys who are Bali's last black pigs.
The mothers aren't quite convinced.
We need someone to come and study it.
The yellow box was called the administration complex.
The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it.
And if you're interested in being involved in finishing Green School and building the next 50 around the world, please come and see us.
Maybe I wasn't as smart, but I was at least as talkative.
The first surgery was a great success.
And then a third attempt, which also patched me back together pretty well, until it failed.
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice?
I thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer.
But it wasn't that simple.
When I heard it the first time, it sent chills down my spine.
Many blind people use them to read pages on the Web to themselves.
Now I have spoken my last words, and I don't even remember for sure what they were.
When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday, about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world, I had a flashback.
I have learned from Wikipedia that, starting with that humble beginning, PLATO established forums, message boards, online testing, email, chat rooms, picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing and multiple-player games.
We use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others.
Every time there was a surgery that failed, I was left with a little less flesh and bone.
Sometimes they assume I am deaf.
One of my Twitter friends can type only with his toes.
I would be trapped inside my head.
I now propose a test for computer voices -- the Ebert test.
It should be opinion-driven; less news, more views.
Before, I was an architect, and my grandmother asked me once, "What are you doing for a living?"
And music has a rhythm, has ups and downs.
Just some examples: in Russia, plus 11 after one year, plus 29 after three years of the redesign.
So first you ask a big question: why we do it? What is the goal?
And who's responsible? Designers.
I'd like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa -- those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid.
This is your place, you stay here."
So bear with me as I take you through this journey.
The bumper of the car hit my throat, slicing it open.
And I ended up with a plastic nose, porcelain teeth and all kinds of other things.
But if you think about all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now, that's what a senior home has.
And so the senior citizens realized that they needed to have an emergency meeting.
So they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture -- gave me pots and pans, blankets, everything.
But for me, I was an adult and it was embarrassing, and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips, and capture the air and get the word out.
One of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross a street again as a blind person.
Made perfect sense.
So one day I was in my room and I saw this thing sitting in my room and I thought it was a monster.
I need all the courage I can muster to die at the age of 20."
But contained inside those documents was a new language, a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science -- namely symmetry.
And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful, you're probably drawn to the lower two.
But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry.
Seven of them are exactly the same, and the eighth one is turned upside down.
But I wanted to try and enrich him.
Can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the Alhambra?
But it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry inside the Alhambra.
So, this object has six symmetries.
The Rubik's Cube.
So I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F, are the names for the rotations.
And there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other.
And this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects -- they both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries?
It's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry.
And then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge, where I can rotate by 180 degrees.
This is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor.
How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?
Five or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down.
Okay, how many digits do you have in your number?
You are now immortal.
Let's go to 40,000 years before the present, to the time of the cultural explosion, when music, art, technology, so many of the things that we're enjoying today, so many of the things that are being demonstrated at TED were born.
It was really bad news.
There is evidence that the human mouth and teeth are growing smaller all the time.
The Hippocratic manuscripts also -- repeatedly, according to recent studies -- show how important it is not to do harm.
And that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger.
And my favorite example of that -- which is not really widely known as a technological miracle, but it may be one of the greatest of all times, was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War.
And my favorite example of that occurred beginning in 1976, when it was discovered that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters, but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of Legionella bacillus.
So it shows that we're really all in this together.
So this was the best job he could get.
If we think, for example, of Louis Pasteur, who in the 1860s was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry, and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease.
And we can also remember how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge, to share their knowledge, in the face of an emergency, which they hadn't really been for years and years.
Just by osmosis. Nobody ever sits down and tells you, "This is how it works."
Just hit the space bar twice.
David Pogue: Unfortunately, the carriers didn't adopt the same keystroke, so it's different by carrier, so it devolves upon you to learn the keystroke for the person you're calling.
Again, you don't have to click one of the results.
Just type over it.
You all get your California technology license.
And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk.
Also, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that?
Or if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up and, you know, toss it to the corner.
Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me, their words sounded like meaningless noise.
Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun, exciting, and that it can rock you.
But it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that.
That its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it -- the world around us and the world inside us.
It's not just going to disappear.
And he said, "Well, financial services."
You just tip your hand.
All they had was just a monitor in front of them that had the numbers on it and just a red button that said, "Stop."
They started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others -- there's Dinosaur Planet; there's Gravity.
And you can run your script through there, and they can tell you, quantifiably, that that's a 30 million dollar movie or a 200 million dollar movie.
And you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them, and they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom.
And you see why. You see why.
And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds.
And that's going to keep happening.
But I can read this map, and what this map says is that, if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are, that's where people are, where the cities are, you're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are to do that most effectively.
And we will have to understand those as nature, and in a way, they are.
JS: Again.
JS: Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is important because it allows interstitial suspension.
If you're really quick, if you're really quick -- and I can prove this -- this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building.
So, 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket that got me thinking.
So, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking, which means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution, less time wasted, and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency than we have in the United States.
Cars rarely appear on that third road.
Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth, you could actually buy the property, cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line, and then sell it off again.
So, why not use a yield sign?
Everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire.
It was supposed to break, but that's okay.
You can see the sort of break in the everyday.
The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how, as a young artist, he thought he was a painter, and he lived in Florence after graduate school.
Richard Serra had to let go of painting in order to embark on this playful exploration that led him to the work that he's known for today: huge curves of steel that require our time and motion to experience. In sculpture, Richard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting.
You know where this story goes.
I'll find a way to get in, because I don't want to see this history disappear."
But the fact is, I'm there, it looks like that, you have to take a picture.
I went to school in a little school called Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick, and on my last day there, a girl came up to me and she said, "I remember the first time that I met you."
And you were walking along and you were handing the lollipops out to people in line and talking about Shinerama.
And she walks away, and I'm flattened.
And every single one of you, every single one of you has been the catalyst for a lollipop moment.
We need to get over it so we can move beyond it, and our little brothers and our little sisters, and one day our kids -- or our kids right now -- can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other's lives more than money and power and titles and influence.
I'd like to share with you a story about how I've experienced this very dramatically in my own work.
Here it is on the top of the building with plenty of windows to let light in.
We heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society, what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute.
But very often several days later, the patient's gone home, we get a phone call: "I'm sorry, once we looked at the final pathology, once we looked at the final specimen, we actually found that there's a couple other spots where the margins are positive.
Nothing will be specific.
So here's an example of a nerve that has tumor surrounding it.
In this movie, you can see that the tumor is green.
And then if that node has cancer, the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection.
So with our technology, we can tell right away.
But equally important is to preserve things that are important for function.
We're trying to preserve nerves; we can't see where they are.
Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is?
We published our results in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and in Nature Biotechnology.
We are focused on making this technology better.
And that is the light that I want to shine on health and medicine today.
Given the amount of time that we spend indoors, it's important to understand how this affects our health.
If you look at the y-axis of this graph, you'll see that, in the mechanically ventilated air, you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen, or germ, than if you're outdoors.
It matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the United States.
Think about your day for a second.
And this process, which takes just a millisecond or so, happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells, as long as you live and think and feel.
They take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people.
Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go?
And to do that -- the brain doesn't feel pain -- you can put -- taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the Internet and communications and so on -- optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate, in animal models for example, in pre-clinical studies, these neurons and to see what they do.
And because it's a protein, it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism.
And there's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light-activated cells.
Because if you could find those, those would be some of the signals that could drive learning.
Now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough, indeed, to drive learning.
And there's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner, so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this.
And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin.
Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson's deep-brain stimulators implanted.
I wanted to close with one story, which we think could potentially be a clinical application.
So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras.
These different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans.
To close, I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology.
So with blue light, we can drive information, and it's in the form of a one.
And so I started to think, well, you know, density, density -- I'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call.
People were out.
But nonetheless, just 20 blocks north, two days later, the city had never looked more alive.
Same thing to the question of, who was keeping the streets alive post-9/11 in my neighborhood?
That is -- you know, there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think, which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it, and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link.
Because effectively, what's happening here, what's creating this page, obviously -- and we all know this, but it's worth just thinking about it -- is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson, but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it, and Google just sitting there and running the numbers.
This is what they think about my site; it's ranked by blog authority.
That little list there would change.
I had no idea.
And by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel, I think, right there.
1985, right at the center of the Reagan years -- that's, we're, there's, we've, it's.
It follows a power law, so that there are a few extremely well-linked to, popular blogs, and a long tail of blogs with very few links.
If you're the second site there, most people link to you.
I hope it continues here.
Indeed, it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle.
Given the access to technology, even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a DVD onto a white board.
It is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor.
They celebrated a change in attitude towards non-white Britons, but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity, unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage.
Who was right, who wrong?
Quite recently she told me that in 1948, two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents.
It was Leni Riefenstahl in her elegant Nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure.
And though not real, Eve Harrington, Howard Beale, Mildred Pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human, and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England.
Thank you.
We're going to do working memory today.
I'm going to give you five words, and I just want you to hang on to them.
All right. I want you to take out your left hand and I want you to go, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10."
And it's going to be really important here at TED because you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas.
All of that occurs within working memory.
You do know the solution to that, right?
We negotiate that through strategies.
So we need to think about it here.
We need to take advantage of that.
Now, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear.
That was one sentence.
Commerce, on the other hand, is relatively quick, essentially creative, highly effective and efficient, and fundamentally honest, because we can't exchange value for very long if we don't trust each other.
So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful, then you're just moving chess pieces around, if you don't know you're taking the king.
So we realized we want full diversity, even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said when asked what it was like to be President of France.
Clean soil is a critical problem -- the nitrification, the dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico.
Here's Dr. Venkataswamy in India, who's figured out how to do mass-produced health.
During the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day.
When asked, they said, "It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush."
We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville, where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson.
Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good, because, in our lexicon, asphalt is two words: assigning blame.
We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition.
"Customers."
Here's a building at Oberlin College we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water.
And we now have 350-pound auto workers learning bird songs on the Internet.
Now we do it by molecule. These are our cities.
The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations.
The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone.
Due to be opened very soon, it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center.
And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever, keep it for extended periods of time, keep it for years, keep it for decades.
I love freedom, but even I agree that some surveillance is fine.
We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans.
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind.
So for example, they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11, 2007, for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008, and then others: Google, Facebook, Skype, Apple and so on.
All countries spy.
And the answer is zero.
It's the war on terror.
Feel free to survey me if that helps.
What am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something?
And surveillance changes history.
So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things.
But maybe you don't have to do it alone.
It's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement.
And that's shown here in the the very light blue.
And how they're distributed really contributes to their underlying function.
And each neuron itself is largely unique.
They're encoded in the DNA.
We want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of 20 to 60, they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain, no history of psychiatric disease, no drugs on board -- we do a toxicology workup.
So we collect this MR.
And then what we get is our first mapping.
And then the laser actually cuts.
We're taking over a thousand samples for each brain.
So here's the modalities that we put together.
We're just starting to look at this data ourselves.
And for the first time, we can actually do that.
Most of you are probably familiar with genome-wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying, "Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect X."
But the fact is our genomes are greater than 99 percent similar.
These are two genes that we found as good examples.
And I suspect many of you gave something to the people of Haiti this year.
Or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help, on the contrary it might hurt, it might exacerbate corruption, dependence, etc.?
And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress.
Is it the leeches? Is it something else?
How do you use your million to solve this last mile problem?
"Not so fast," say other people.
Do you provide school lunch?
And I'll give you some examples with those three questions.
So let's try them.
On the other hand, if your problem is you tend to postpone, then it might give you a reason to act today rather than later.
Now, you might say, "Well, but it's not sustainable.
The third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts, it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets.
So, how about the purchasing?
So people do not get used to handouts; they get used to nets.
So, is that sufficient? If we think they should work intuitively, should we go for them?
Suppose you have 100 dollars to spend on various interventions.
But if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars for every child under five who dies, that would be 90 billion per year just for that problem.
But look what we just did today.
And yet, when the young global leader in Davos showed the numbers I gave you, they started Deworm the World.
These economics I'm proposing, it's like 20th century medicine.
We are on an amazing journey the next four days.
More.
So let's get going because Africa, to some degree, is on a turnaround.
Because Nelson Mandela, as he took over power as the first democratically-elected president of South Africa, faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos.
With no natural light source, Siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry.
Because whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas -- it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there.
What does the data say?
Nigeria: a similar situation, from the 16 percent to the eight percent. Single digits.
But opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist.
Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa were Bain Capital and KKR, the big boys of private equity.
The new report, "The Next Eleven," highlights that by 2020 Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world.
It's just a sign of things to come.
Again, gathering together farmers, gathering together stakeholders in East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices.
The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.
So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing?
And global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties.
In fact, one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa.
And think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly.
So I started shooting time-lapse photography.
The "my" means it connects with something deep inside your soul.
We just think of good weather and bad weather.
It's a gift that millions and millions in the world will never experience.
What should I try to emulate to some degree?
I basically shot everything with short lenses, which means that you're very close to the action, but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots which gives you a sense of distance, so I was basically was setting up something that would remind you of something you haven't really quite seen before.
And, I guess somebody thought they needed to do that.
And he was looking at me. It's like, Yeah, I don't know if you noticed, but I'm the guy out in the parking lot recreating one of America's finest moments with fire extinguishers.
Now, Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin, who was not on the movie, so he had no idea that we were faking any of this footage, and he just responded as he would respond, and I'll run this.
I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life.
And it's literally done by using what our brains naturally do for us, which is, as soon as you shift your attention, something changes, and then I left the little scarf going, because it really wanted to be a ghostly shot, really wanted to feel like they were still on the wreck, essentially. That's where they were buried forever.
That doesn't move."
The one on the left is where the shot ends, and the shot on the right is where it takes over, and now we switch boys, so it went from Asa Butterfield, who's the star of the show, to his stand-in.
Now, I'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how.
Excellent, OK. Extend your fingers like this for me.
And it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out.
KT: OK, but don't say my name like that.
Have you ever heard of second sight?
We're going uphill, are we going uphill?
KB: And I've stopped.
I couldn't see through the blindfold.
I need two people to help me out real quick.
Your name is?
OK, a little bit closer.
KB: Besides, who's next, no, OK.
Nicole: Twice.
OK.
I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop.
OK, that was wonderfully done. Let's try it again.
OK, now, imagine the connection, OK.
Most people ask you, "What the hell just happened up here?"
Do you want to try it?
Now, have a look at the Coke bottle.
Now, hold it out here.
Think of one of the letters in the title.
Actually, Chris, I was going to pick you for this, but instead of picking you, can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment?
They just, they insist that because I was a magician, put a nice, black tablecloth on.
KB: No one in the audience. And just to help you out, I'll block them from view, so nobody can see what you're doing.
They'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny.
KB: You can't see through it. Excellent, OK.
Tell me when you're done.
KB: I told you I'd have the last laugh.
KB: Neither, oh, OK.
If anybody wants to see some sleight of hand later on, I'll be outside.
I am one of the one in four. Thank you.
But that's not what happened. I had my breakdown during my daughter's sports day.
So you start to hear these abusive voices, but you don't hear one abusive voice, you hear about a thousand -- 100,000 abusive voices, like if the Devil had Tourette's, that's what it would sound like.
There is some good news. First of all, let me say, we've come a long, long way.
So, zizzing away, and so — — And for every one — I know, I drew this myself. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
It was all due to this woman, Sister Mary Marastela, also known as my mom.
It's called oxytocin.
There must be a reason why."
Now luckily, oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood, so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery.
I don't want to just ask people, "Are you trustworthy?"
The trick is you can't see them, you can't talk to them.
So this was the birth of vampire economics.
But wait. What's wrong with this experiment?
To investigate this question, we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year-old son, and his son has terminal brain cancer.
So if I do something that hurts you, I feel that pain.
I'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara, California.
And a man says very excitedly, "I was in your gas station a while ago, and I bought this jewelry for my wife, and I can't find it."
Again he asked me, "What do you think we should do?"
We found, testing thousands of individuals, that five percent of the population don't release oxytocin on stimulus.
You need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly.
And men have 10 times the testosterone as women, so men do this more than women -- we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally.
Then the groom's father, then the groom, then the family, then the friends -- arrayed around the bride like planets around the Sun.
So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System.
Two weeks ago, I just got back from Papua New Guinea where I went up to the highlands -- very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia.
There you go.
I do have a plan, but in order for me to tell you what that plan is, I need to tell you a little story, which kind of sets the stage.
They made another machine to produce those people: the school.
I'm not saying they're broken.
They do need to be able to read.
And they said, "Can we touch it?"I said, "If you wish to."
When they saw me, they said, "We want a faster processor and a better mouse."
Then onto other parts of the country, I repeated this over and over again, getting exactly the same results that we were.
They did that, and watch a little bit of this.
I'll spend a couple of months, I'll leave it for a couple of months, I'll go back, they'll get another zero.
They'd got a zero. I gave them a test.
Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm.
Whenever they do anything, you just say, 'Well, wow, I mean, how did you do that?
It took nature 100 million years to make the ape stand up and become Homo sapiens.
Why did they create a system like that?
I got 200 in the first two weeks.
Watch this.
It's about letting it happen.
Here's a SOLE in action.
We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle.
So what's my wish?
I'll take you to the top of the Himalayas.
Thank you. Thank you.
So basically, with both of your hands you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes, when really it's continuously going ...
And a lot of times, even kids nowadays, they'll make reference to a theremin by going, "Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo," because in the '50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies, that sound that's like ...
And it's like, "Well, I'm about to go on soon; I don't want to be like -- -- you know?"
Family members had bribed officials to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land by having the brothers declared dead, allowing them to inherit their father's share of the ancestral farmland.
And for this work, I traveled around the world over a four-year period researching and recording bloodlines and their related stories.
So it's more disordered.
Two of his wives were brought to him suffering from infertility and he cured them, three for evil spirits, one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain and two wives Ondijo claims he took for love, paying their families a total of 16 cows.
Twenty-four European rabbits were brought to Australia in 1859 by a British settler for sporting purposes, for hunting.
So over a two-day period, six individuals from this bloodline were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.
However, the other individuals are represented by these blue slides, which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals.
Previously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda, the State Council Information Office is responsible for all of China's external publicity operations.
And finally, another individual sat for me from behind and later rescinded his participation, so I had to pixelate him out so he's unrecognizable.
This feud has been going on since 1991 in Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco, and it involved the deaths of 20 members of the families and 40 others associated with the feud, including hired hit men, innocent bystanders and friends.
Children at this Ukrainian orphanage are between the ages of six and 16.
It's almost machine-like the way people are born and people die, and the stories keep coming and coming.
And, you know, we open it up and I read the music.
And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares.
I see that you're clutching a teddy bear, etc., etc.
By holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached.
And I said, "Yes, I agree with that. So what's the problem?"
Because of course, the ear is, I mean, subject to all sorts of things.
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry.
So there's always, always that huge -- I mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from.
So to find an actual hall is incredible -- for which you can play exactly what you imagine, without it being cosmetically enhanced.
Those are hugely important aspects to think about.
I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder.
Now -- great imagination, thank you very much.
And instead of him saying, "OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart, arms at a more-or-less 90 degree angle, sticks in a more-or-less V shape, keep this amount of space here, etc.
Like that. And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster.
"Why am I practicing paradiddles?
Tom Green: Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year.
So, what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous, and it has no memory.
And it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, and Rick Astley pops out, and rickrolls millions of people on television.
And I will spare you that slide.
So they broke that poll.
And so these people, over 7,000 people, less than one month later, organized in a hundred cities around the globe and -- this is L.A. -- protested the Church of Scientology, and they have continued to do so, now, two full years after the fact.
Within 24 hours, they had his name, and within 48 hours, he was arrested.
Got a couple questions for you.
But -- Tell me about what -- I mean, I think you asked the board what you might say at TED, right?
Right, it's gone? Or is it still up there?
I mean, obviously, it's got some very offensive, obscene content on it, just in terms of language alone.
And they were probably pleased to see you on top of the Time poll.
And as it turns out, it actually corresponds really nicely with geologic history.
Really interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size.
This slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx.
I thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution, I'd have to go back to those beds where they had picked up fragments, go back to a time and a place where the earliest dinosaurs existed.
Now, if you want to understand what happened then when the continents broke apart, and dinosaurs found -- landlubbers, as they are -- found themselves adrift. There's some missing puzzle pieces.
And the kinds of teams they bring in?
These are the Tuareg nomads, and they're living their lives much as they have for centuries.
Here's the animal that was causing it trouble.
It turns out to have a forebrain one-fifteenth the size of a human.
The crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus.
OK, hand me some more here. OK.
That's a big skull.
And then work later is going to take us to Tibet.
With regard to the biogeographic question, the Earth is dividing.
It carves up the history of life, and gives us the differences that we see in the dinosaur world towards the end, right before the bolide impact.
Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago, which is related to the fact that I never -- and actually, in talking to a lot of TEDsters, there's a number of you out there -- I don't know that I'd get an answer honestly, if I asked you to raise your hand, but there are a number of you out there that started your scientific, technical, entertainment career as failures, by society's standards, as failures by schools.
I worked up a portfolio, and I was headed to New York.
But what we're trying to create in Chicago is a way to get, collect together, those students who are least represented in our science and technology spheres.
And I hope to God the United States government, me, or TED, or somebody helps us do that, because that would be an incredible thing for their country.
It's an impressive track record, and so we look back and we say, well, we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start, but when we look back, there are theoretical movements in science education.
The gun goes off, and she's not even an underdog.
She catches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line.
You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills; somehow water's involved.
They're not doing 26 miles; they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time, and apparently without injury, without problems.
Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain.
That would be an Olympic event: turn a squirrel loose -- whoever catches the squirrel, you get a gold medal.
Yes. You would have torn reproductive organs.
Well Emily Baer -- 500 runners -- she finishes in eighth place, in the top 10, even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race -- and yet, beat 492 other people.
You take a horse on a hot day, and after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice.
You need to have those 64-, 65-year-olds who have been doing this for a long time to understand which antelope you're actually trying to catch.
You can't be hauling all your crap around, trying to chase the antelope.
We try to cash in on it.
Geronimo used to say that, "My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs."
Stop focusing on urban marathons, which, if you do four hours, you suck.
Because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence, up until the 1970s or so, the benefits, social and physical and political and mental, could be astounding.
I knew robots like that didn't really exist, but I knew I wanted to build them.
This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo, introducing Leo to a new object.
He wants to get your cookies.
Mimicry's believed to play a role, but how?
For instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues, maybe they would be a cool, new communication technology.
And then the fully expressive MeBot.
Today we know that families are living further and further apart, and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance.
So in the United States today, over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese, and now it's a big problem with our children as well.
It could share information looking down at a screen.
People would name the robots.
I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended-reality play.
So they are now sending the character back into that world.
So this is a new project.
My leather Adidas baseball cap matches my fake Gucci backpack.
Cut school Friday, catch the subway downtown, check out my victims hangin' around.
Had my pistol and knew just what to do.
I killed to get 'em, but hey, I don't care, because now I needs a new jacket to wear."
Then one day I told him, "Reg E., what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration?"
I'm so experienced that when you went to a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet, I was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me.
You think black entertainers have it hard finding work in this business? I'm a suspicious mulatto, which means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right.
Momentum was being built.
So, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband, and this was a sequence of images.
And that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now: the more pictures you see of these celebrities, the more you feel you know them, but you don't know them and you want to know them further.
Then suddenly, it started to get on front pages.
They thought it was real.
And what is going to happen to the monarchy?
But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on, you're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that's all you're doing.
It was a bit of a road stopper, which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds, but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance.
And then you change the photograph he's shooting at, and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible. .
This image I've decided to show having a reservation about it.
You just need to look at them a little differently.
We set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks.
Certainly not good for the police department.
Every project has its surprises, and one of the big surprises with Times Square was how quickly people flocked to the space.
It was about those lawn chairs.
So what we did is we painted over the street, put down epoxy gravel, and connected the triangle to the storefronts on Grand Avenue, created a great new public space, and it's been great for businesses along Grand Avenue.
We've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes and turned them into new pedestrian space.
I love this because it looks so easy.
The green line is the number of bike lanes.
Since we've launched the program, three million trips have been taken.
In the past, it looked like the guy on the left, ninja-clad bike messenger.
And that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it.
You're having a heart attack. What are you going to do?
If you cannot secure the parents, you cannot guarantee the security of the African child.
We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV.
These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa demand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things the way we've always done them.
I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States -- I live in Nashville, Tennessee, health care capital of America.
Whether you have one dollar, two dollars -- it doesn't matter.
So, for a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S. -- that you'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars -- when we're finished manufacturing it in-house, we come at a price of about two dollars.
The patient doesn't have to travel.
Prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that.
That way we start exposing the children from very early on, on what these issues are. Because once they learn it, they will stay with it. In doing this we have created at least 100 skilled jobs in Jamaica alone, and these are physicians with expertise and special training.
And, if they went to Miami, they will spend significantly more -- eight to 10 times more. And they feel happy spending it at home, getting the same quality of care.
I'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care at the University Hospital of the West Indies.
Next stop is West African Heart Institute, that we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, as I said before. We will do other centers across West Africa.
It's a continuum of traits.
And the thing is, the normal brain ignores the details.
Now, maybe that's not true in this room, but it's going to be true in a lot of different places.
And I've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant.
And the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings, I showed off pictures of things.
Now, the thing is, the visual thinker's just one kind of mind.
You also will see these kind of problems with kids that are dyslexic.
Think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant.
Cattle are the same way.
Is it a minor problem, with something simple I can fix?
My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie.
It's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social.
I mean art was my best subject in school.
I did internships in college, I was building things, and I also had to learn how to do assignments.
I really get fed up when they, you know, the teachers, especially when you get away from this part of the country, they don't know what to do with these smart kids.
You know, my science teacher was not an accredited teacher.
I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me.
Thank you so much for that.
You know, the slaughter plants, I've worked with them in the '80s; they were absolutely awful.
And to me, knowledge is something that is extremely valuable. So, maybe, over 10 years ago now our library got flooded.
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.
Come on.
Come on.
And we sat here and we looked at these two problems, and finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems.
Earlier this year, in March, Clay took his own life.
He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.
They pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade.
Can you spot the vegetable?
Except, of course, this morning.
World peace.
And yet, when we look back on the printing press in the early years, we like what happened.
And so they invented the scientific journal as a way of synchronizing the argument across the community of natural scientists.
Programming is a three-way relationship between a programmer, some source code, and the computer it's meant to run on, but computers are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions that it's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set of instructions that the computer knows how to execute, and that's if one person is writing it.
Now, that's fine for the commercial software industry.
And when people draw diagrams of Git workflow, they use drawings that look like this.
Now, I tell you all of this not to convince you that it's great that open-source programmers now have a tool that supports their philosophical way of working, although I think that is great.
And I don't just mean that always happens with the Internet, I mean that always happens with media, full stop.
The New York Senate has put up something called Open Legislation, also hosting it on GitHub, again for all of the reasons of updating and fluidity.
No democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets, even though those are the things done with our consent and with our money.
So consider this.
A new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes, in the last decade, in fact.
So, that's what we call our first five employees during the tea break, you know, in here.
But even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves, sometimes there are setbacks.
So that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things, you know, and the serious things that we try to do.
You've got to do what you want to do.
You look outside: you have all that beauty that you see, all that life that you see around you, and here we have intelligent people like you and I who are having a conversation here.
But literally, we are all made of stardust.
It has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars, which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet.
This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite.
Now, it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving down a slope like this.
Yeah!
And we wanted to find out -- and we see all kinds of glacial features on it.
It's the first mission that's going to try to land near the North Pole of Mars, and it's the first mission that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet.
BC: From this point, we're going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour down to 900 miles an hour.
We no longer need the heat shield to protect us from the force of atmospheric entry, so we jettison the heat shield, exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars.
LC: So it's in a free-fall, but it's also trying to use all of its actuators to make sure that it's in the right position to land.
So it will be a very tense moment, you know, as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet.
And we really love being close to the art center, because we have, as a matter of fact, one of the alumni from the art center, Eric Nyquist, had put a series of displays, far-out displays, you know, in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room, just to get people to think wildly about things.
Unfortunately this Rover is, like, ten times the size of the, you know, mass-wise, of the other Rover, or three times the mass.
So it's a little bit like "Star Wars," you know, but it's real.
So, let me show you a little bit on what that Saturnian system looks like.
What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself.
We saw geysers coming out.
So if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder, and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane.
It looks like there are rivers on it, there are oceans or lakes, we know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it.
There is a -- I'm not sure you can see it very well, but on the top left, around 10 o'clock, there is a little teeny dot, and that's Earth.
And many of these technologies -- speaking as a physician and innovator -- we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care, and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today, ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population, the way we really don't use information very well today, the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation.
And we bring together every summer about 100 very talented students from around the world.
Let's start with faster.
And by understanding these sorts of processes and these sorts of connections, we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective, for example, psychoactive drugs.
Oh, we might have missed it, but using A.I. on top of radiology, we can find lesions that were missed before.
Here in the Netherlands, I think it's more than 80 percent.
The ability to interact with your health care provider is different.
A whole gamut of these technologies are being put together.
Now we've talked about augmenting the patient, to some degree.
For those who have disabilities -- the paraplegic -- there's the era of brain-computer interface, or BCI, where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or, eventually, a robotic arm.
This is Aimee Mullins, who lost her lower limbs as a young child, and Hugh Herr, who's a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident.
On the cardiac side, pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so you don't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them.
How about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone again to see at a microscopic level and to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics?
We're now approaching essentially a thousand-dollar genome -- probably next year to two years, probably a hundred-dollar genome.
I might want to watch how much dessert I have at the lunch break for example.
This has been called by Lee Hood, the father of the field, P4 medicine.
So I've studied a lot about stem cells -- embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful.
But where is stem cell therapy really going?
But often it's too late and it's Stage III or IV cancer, for example.
My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap; half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar.
She lived to a hundred, even then. All along it was the sadness, the squalor, but I never, until now loved her again.
What release finally, the embrace: though we were wary -- it seemed so audacious -- how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion, no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then.
Her shadow once, fumbling the chain on her door, then the door slamming fearfully shut, only the barking and the music -- jazz -- filtering as it does, day and night into the hall.
My sweet angels, come back."
Wouldn't it be nice, I think, when the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts, just a little, and violently blushes.
"Thirst."
Instead, I'd step into my train.
Herself fall.
I'll read just one more. I don't usually say that.
God knows though, there are worse twists your obsessions can take.
But it was like sex, you didn't have to be told.
No. Again, no.
Many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time -- its smallness, its fragility.
The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact.
A simple act, in 1987, of the most famous woman in the world, the Princess of Wales, touching an HIV/AIDS infected baby did a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that.
I'll show you one photo here, and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran from an extraordinary piece of work, which has never been published, called War Is Personal.
I hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you, you'll better understand why, and I know that speaking to this audience, you'll definitely do something about it.
It's a journey that is right at the limit of human capability.
This was like my polar apprenticeship.
We started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry, losing lots of weight.
And of course, neither of these things happened.
Very famous, very accomplished Italian mountaineer, Reinhold Messner, tried it in 1995, and he was rescued after a week.
We got to Khatanga.
I was, you can see there, pulling two sledges.
I got up in the morning, took the tent down, skied north for seven-and-a-half hours, put the tent up, and I was two and a half miles further back than when I'd started.
Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines.
The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket.
It took me 68 days to get there from Russia, and there is nothing there.
She started crying. She asked me to call her back.
The only bit of ice I could find -- it took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip -- was exactly 473 meters. I could measure it with my skis.
The door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said, "Hi, my name is Troy."
Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his.
At the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip.
It's the coldest, highest, windiest and driest continent on Earth.
Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing -- no one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan.
I was very excited. I walked with him to his office.
None of those happened.
And when we run experiments, we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another.
What would have happened if he was in the other group?
And that's a much, much more difficult lesson to take into account.
I mean, this is all very depressing, right -- people have conflicts of interest, we don't see it, and so on.
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.
It's something we fight. It's something we overcome.
The same incredible imaginations that produced "The Origin of Species," "Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past," also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of Charles Darwin, Charlotte BrontĂŤ and Marcel Proust.
And fears and storytelling have the same components.
Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.
If an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry, what will happen to our house? What will happen to my family?
But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears that our imaginations concoct.
Why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other?
Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about serial killers and plane crashes, and more time concerned with the subtler and slower disasters we face: the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries, the gradual changes in our climate.
So there's the scientific method, but what's really going on is this.
Just to put that in some perspective, that's the weight of two normal human brains.
And it's been really quite an interesting time for me to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk about what it is they don't know.
We all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts, this accumulation model of science, as many have called it, and it seems impregnable, it seems impossible.
The facts are important. You have to know a lot of stuff to be a scientist. That's true.
Indeed, there are many of us who aren't so sure about the manufacturer.
So if you think of knowledge being this ever-expanding ripple on a pond, the important thing to realize is that our ignorance, the circumference of this knowledge, also grows with knowledge.
We're using it to make better ignorance, to come up with, if you will, higher-quality ignorance.
This graph asks the relationship between what you know and how much you know about it.
This whole view can be changed by just changing the label on the x-axis.
They work differently than our visual systems in some cases, but nonetheless we've been pretty good at making a technology work like our visual system.
These are just plain old molecules, but if you sniff those molecules up these two little holes in the front of your face, you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose.
I mean, that's remarkable to me, clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet.
We just can't sell facts for a living anymore.
They're interested.
And that's meant as a warning.
Because that's what we want people to do, and that's how you evaluate them.
I was placed at the center of that war because I was covering the war from the northern part of Iraq.
A new generation, well-educated, connected, inspired by universal values and a global understanding, has created a new reality for us.
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.
And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people -- people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority.
And now Libya as you see it.
In front of Facebook, they brought the camels in Tahrir Square.
They have lost.
If you switch off the cameras tonight, there will be a genocide.
The future should be ruled by people themselves, even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us.
There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical, or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos.
Because we discovered that people care, and people would like to know -- they are receiving the stream through our Internet.
That's what spreads HIV."
Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs, and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational, they are erections and addiction.
Please let there be some left.'" And then, telling me this story, Frankie said, "You know ... God, drugs really make you stupid."
"Oh yeah." Hundred percent.
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.
For once, your incentives are aligned.
So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this.
And what we've got is a very, very high level of virus right at the beginning when you're first infected, then you start making antibodies, and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time -- 10 or 12 years -- you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa.
And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.
But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision-making.
But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need.
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex -- and in drug users, you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins, and that's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier.
But once they've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone to being AIDS victims, we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.
There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet, and that's one of the glories of human existence.
She said, "Be good to your friends.
Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.
Well, she and I went blackberry picking.
One more time now.
I went up to him and said, how can I learn that?
Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks, who just passed away last year.
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up.
You don't know how hard it is to earn money. Your dad works so hard.
She said, "Would you put them to work?"
He just sang: "Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.
Finally, by the end of the day, we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton.
And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can.
Good news: Chariot's coming.
And I don't want it to leave me behind.
Good news: Chariot's coming.
And I would sit around with it, and I didn't know how to play it, but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play.
While you can hardly move, they're running around having all kinds of fun.
They were about my age.
Man, we were only 10, but we knew that made gunpowder.
Well, my brother heard that we had made gunpowder.
He said, "Yeah, hey, it's melting. Yeah, the sulfur's melting.
At that time, drum triggers were new.
We want to be in the forefront fields, and we want to do it differently.
And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution.
In fact, Newton and Locke were friends.
Now, in the 20th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century, and which is still going on.
And also, if you're embedded in such a network of relationships, your view of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of relations.
Then you want to know, you're a person, you want to know how is it made.
And if you push that all the way down, really, it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational.
And also, is that in the 21st century our thinking about space and time and cosmology, and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve.
Every seven years, I close it for one year to pursue some little experiments, things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year.
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.
Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.
And then just leave it all to them.
It's called Be Here Now.
And I'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals.
Scotch tape came out of this program, as well as Art Fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.
I had thought that I should do this without any plan, that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation. It was not.
I had fun.
If Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo.
You can grow it underneath the skin.
I'll just show two now.
So we got brand new ones, shiny ones, medium ones, and very old, dark ones.
So after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing.
So we asked those guys to do it again.

So every year, thousands of visitors come to Tana Toraja to see, as it were, this culture of death, and for many people these grandiose ceremonies and the length of the ceremonies are somehow incommensurable with the way that we face our own mortality in the West.
And here you can see these wooden effigies of the ancestors, so these are people who have already been buried, already had a funeral ceremony.
So at funerals, relationships are reconfirmed but also transformed in a ritual drama that highlights the most salient feature about death in this place: its impact on life and the relationships of the living.
And his death will be greatly mourned.
So I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience should run out and adopt the traditions of the Torajans.
I don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't.
Nuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that.
If I could start, this is the Enigma decoding machine.
It's great. It's fantastic.
No, no, ahh ...
No."
Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the Mansion House in 2002 -- that was to the building; the people weren't listening.
And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it.
And that's, you know, that's something -- And that's something we can relate to.
And when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities at Lehman Brothers said, "Events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days."
And I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it? An American President who has to write without smudging the ink.
But we proved them wrong in Iraq.
And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right?
And it's great to have an American president who can say the word "nuclear," let's just point that out first.
"Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ..."
Or, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire.
Shall I ask for a show of hands or a clapping of people in different generations?
That's it.
Lots of different kinds.
Look at these dinosaurs.
So allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth.
Now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal, is a young one or an older one.
So if you cut open a little dinosaur, it's very spongy inside like A.
Now as you can imagine, cutting open a leg bone is one thing, but when you go to a museum and say, "You don't mind if I cut open your dinosaur's skull do you?"
You can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities.
And the other one is more primitive than the other.
So it is going to get bigger.
Which of course means we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with.
But what was interesting was the adult Triceratops was also spongy.
So one of my graduate students, John Scannella, looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in Triceratops and, of course it's open, in Torosaurus -- so he found the transitional ones between Triceratops and Torosaurus, which was pretty cool.
Here's another one.
And that doesn't make any sense at all, because we don't know of any dinosaurs that gain teeth as they get older.
So when it comes down to our end cretaceous, we have seven left.
It's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass.
So, no walls, no roof, no purpose -- just a mass of atomized water, a big cloud.
These are the fog nozzles, the interface, and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather, and producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather.
Anyway, moving along.
Anyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know, the problem of the retrospective was something we were very uncomfortable with.
We worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain.
And so this was a three-month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element.
And there's not enough time to really introduce the building, but I'll simply say that the building negotiates between this outwardly focused nature of the site -- you know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston -- and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum.
In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a climax, but to have the view stalk you, so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other.
Moving along to Lincoln Center.
And this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped.
Next we wrap the entire hall -- almost like this Olivetti keyboard -- with a material, with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces: wall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes.
And this is a guy from Salt Lake City, this is what they look like out there.
We make up half the population of the world, but we're just 24 percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories, and we're just 20 percent of the experts quoted in stories, and now, with today's technology, it's possible to remove women from the picture completely.
The problem is, of course, there aren't enough women in newsrooms.
This is what we found in our reporting."
She had been a bright, easygoing girl.
She's not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female.
Manga girls.
He told the former ombudsman at National Public Radio, who was doing a report on how women fare in NPR coverage, unconscious bias flows throughout most of our lives.
Now I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul can find women to interview. Not so sure about rural, traditional areas, where I'm guessing women can't talk to strange men.
Remember, a complete picture of reality may depend upon it.
With the help of IIT, TERI, and learnings from NASA, we discovered that there are three basic green plants, common green plants, with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy.
And this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals.
And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding 15 percent, because you need less fresh air.
PM: Oh.
And when I went out to meet the press, they zeroed in, said, "Why are you wearing that snake pin?"
PM: It is, for all of us, men and women, finding our ways of defining our roles, and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future.
and "will I really say something intelligent?"
Where are we?
Now for instance, some of the wars that took place when I was in office, a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.
So the countries that had women representatives were Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines, Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica, Lichtenstein and me.
M Well I do think, when there are more women, that the tone of the conversation changes, and also the goals of the conversation change.
And it was really terrific.
More women's voices at the table?
Let's go back before Christ, three millennia, to a time when, at least in my head, the journey for justice, the march against inequality and poverty really began.
It's also shown us that something as powerful as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality, because facts, like people, want to be free, and when they're free, liberty is usually around the corner, even for the poorest of the poor -- facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy that leads to inertia, facts that tell us what's working and, more importantly, what's not, so we can fix it, facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made back in 2005, when he asked us to be that great generation that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity, extreme poverty, facts that build a powerful momentum.
For kids under five, child mortality, kids under five, it's down by 2.65 million a year.
It was fought for, it was campaigned for, it was innovated for.
If you're a parent who wants the best for your kids -- and I am -- this rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope.
So the pride of lions is the proof of concept.
We can't get this done until we really accept that we can get this done.
But you can do something about that.
By the time we get there, every place with a rough semblance of governance might actually be on their way.
Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo.
Thank you so much.
And I discovered another fact, which to me was more astonishing almost for the fact that I hadn't known it before at the age of 42, 43.
But elsewhere in the world, if you ask the general public what they know about shipping and how much trade is carried by sea, you will get essentially a blank face.
A couple of years ago, I took a passage on the Maersk Kendal, a mid-sized container ship carrying nearly 7,000 boxes, and I departed from Felixstowe, on the south coast of England, and I ended up right here in Singapore five weeks later, considerably less jet-lagged than I am right now.
So most seafarers now working on container ships often have less than two hours in port at a time.
So we have these very multinational, global, mobile crews on ships.
When are we going to start talking and thinking about shipping miles as well as air miles?
And when I arrived in Singapore, and I apologize for this, but I didn't want to get off my ship.
So, people argue vigorously about the definition of life.
Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be.
So my friends, molecular programmers, and I have a sort of biomolecule-centric approach.
You're going to design something like a cell phone, and in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone.
One of them is Craig Venter's question.
Almost -- many of them are impossible.
This is part of that genome.
That holds the long strand like this.
It's got a needle, like a record needle, that goes back and forth over the surface, bumps up and down, and feels the height of the first surface.
She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami, a beautiful rendition of China, which even has Taiwan, and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash, right?
But this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size of those in a normal computer.
The fact is that it does not scale.
And a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs -- specifically, counting.
It doesn't tell us how babies do it, however.
So you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation.
And I think in the next five or 10 years, we'll make the kind of squares that I described and maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits.
This song kind of came out of all of that.
I built, along with my two brothers, the leading real estate company in my home state, Kerala, and then worked professionally with two of India's biggest businessmen, but in their startup enterprises.
We ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported 125 victims, saving life.
Corruption, bribes, and lack of transparency.
Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day-to-day life to get something done.
All she needed was permission to build three steps to her house, from ground level, making it easier for her to enter and exit her house.
For we are insane people, trying to do an impossible task.
So we actually used the Right to Information Act, which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States, and pushed back the officers in this particular case.
That's a high gross margin business. I like it.
So Sean's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that.
And the meme-ome, you know, quite simply, is the mathematics that underlies an idea, and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it, which I want to share with you now.
So we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this, and the similar talks kind of smash together, and the different ones fly apart, and what we're left with is something quite beautiful.
So you've got food economy and local food at the top, you've got greenhouse gases, solar and nuclear waste.
We might just say, well, what are the most popular talks out there?
We used a measure of ecological diversity to get this.
We've got ourselves in a world that's massively complex, and we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it.
This is a training ground.
Homework is stressful, but when you go home every day and your home is work, you don't want to pick up any assignments.
And he appealed to virtue.
Not one.
And beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means.
You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.
The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.
Scott Simon, who told this story on NPR, said, "Rules and procedures may be dumb, but they spare you from thinking."
Regulate, regulate, regulate.
Let me just give you a few examples, first of rules and the war on moral skill.
And they prevent disaster.
Right?
They thought it would reduce their property values.
The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough.
Be proud that you have them.
One was Ray Anderson, who turned -- -- turned, you know, a part of the evil empire into a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.
But most important to make it work -- and he emphasized this -- is that it took knowing the people in the communities.
If you run an organization, you should be sure that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs -- have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.
I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing that Bill didn't mention.
And I think he was right.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to, instead, in a minute or two, show you an early, crude video because I think it's a better way to tell a story.
"Oh, by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame -- namely 32 inches from the long finger -- and weigh less than nine pounds."
Anyway, I went home that night. I thought about it.
Look what it takes to make things like iPods.
Anyway, with less than 10 hours of use, two guys -- one that's bilateral.
So, can we see that?
So, that's where we were at the end of about 15 months.
We're probably going to have to give them support, encouragement.
Not only were they enthusiastic, they kept thinking they're there to help us.
It was astounding.
We go back to Walter Reed, and a kid, literally, 20 some-odd days before that was blown up.
And he said, "I need your arms, but I need two of them."
So, I was on my way out here.
I'll shut up, except one message or concern I have.
I don't know the answers.
But I was saying to him, "You know, the first airplane went 100 feet in 1903.
But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about who's paying for what and how much we get, the people that are out there giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining, I know what they deserve: everything humanly possible.
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall.
Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other.
Let's get creative against climate change.
The one after that, I stood on top of a hundred foot pillar for 36 hours.
So, I began, early on, competing against the other kids, seeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe, you know, five times, while I stayed under on one breath.
So, I met with a top neurosurgeon.
And he said, "David, you're a magician, create the illusion of not breathing, it will be much easier."
So, that idea disappeared.
You blow in and out ...
Out of 52 minutes you're only breathing for eight minutes.
I'm six foot one, and fat.
In four months of training I was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes.
So, I had to add handcuffs, while holding my breath, to escape from.
So, basically you breath pure O2 first, oxygenating your body, flushing out CO2, and you are able to hold much longer.
The neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind, at 15 minutes your brain is done, you're brain dead.
You know, it was longer than the record.
Which was making me more nervous.
It was a waste of O2.
So, I started to really get really paranoid.
And I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack.
And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds.
And I think magic, whether I'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards, is pretty simple.
And that provides the ground for a type of action, because consensus of each moment allows us to act.
Next assumption -- and of course the events of July 7, I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 -- have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds.
I won't elaborate.
Because it lacks the institutional, organizational, managerial forms to turn it into capital.
And that's the first thing.
But, particularly, what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work.
Today the world of globalization is on speed.
Second is, when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power -- we had the Red Army for 10 continuous years, 110,000 strong, literally terrorizing.
I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here, standing in front of you, speaking.
You know, when I went back in December of 2001, I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist.
Cotton does not compete with opium; a t-shirt does.
And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work.
It depends on what form it comes, what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it.
So the best way of explaining it is to just show it.
All the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself.
So now what I can do is, rather than getting the instructions for the device online, I can simply point at it, the device is recognized, and then -- Voice: Begin by plugging in the grey ADSL cable.
MM: I should leap in.
Move away from it and come back to it.
If you have a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G, this process is very, very quick.
Let me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before.
For, in weather, we're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters, but with life itself.
There's two degrees, or three degrees of climate change baked into the system.
So humans are turning more towards animal consumption.
Last week, Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said, "This situation is unprecedented, unequal, unfair and unstable."
For some, it will lead to anger, religious and sectarian violence and terrorism.
70 percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level.
Do you remember no one had heard of ebola until we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it?
Last year, there were only 2,000 cases in the world.
Certainly, nothing can give you more optimism than that.
And now 4,000 churches have joined the environmental movement.
And you've heard so many inspiring stories here, and I heard so many last night that I thought I would share a little bit of mine.
We visited every house in India, searching for smallpox -- 120 million houses, once every month, for nearly two years.
Doctors, health workers, from 30 different countries, of every race, every religion, every color, worked together, fought alongside each other, fought against a common enemy, didn't fight against each other.
We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization.
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid, created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama.
And if that were all this was about, then it would be an interesting thing.
They did it with pigs.
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures.
He actually was the first person to clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do, because dog genomes are very plastic.
These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species.
And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology -- a question that we're not really sure yet how to solve.
They can't actually make them land.
Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves, to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey's arm did.
Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact, independent lamprey eel brain.
Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation.
For the first time in the history of this planet, we are able to directly design organisms.
It's already happening. It's not science fiction.
He was raised by very supportive and interested parents.
So what did he make of all this?
Now, one of the wonderful things that NASA does is it puts up a variety of satellites that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment.
So, living at the equator, we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin -- this wonderful, complex, ancient polymer compound in our skin -- served as a superb natural sunscreen.
When humans dispersed into these latitudes, what did they face?
There was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin.
Between 1520 and 1867, 12 million, 500 people were moved from high UV to low UV areas in the transatlantic slave trade.
Epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin.
200 years after Darwin's birthday, we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States.
When people ask you, "What is the evidence for evolution?"
Take it out of this room.
Some of them are artificial.
Now, what did humanity do with that?
I hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial.
Each time you're closer, it gets bigger, down to very, very small distances.
Now it's very easy to do.
Why so? Because, in fact, the area of the lung is something very ill-defined.
Sometimes repeatedly: again, again, again, the same repetition.
Now, here is another thing which is rather interesting.
He did not know the mathematics; it didn't yet exist.
I played with it for a while, and I made it return to the origin.
It took my friends 20 years.
To the right, on top, you see a theory which is very, very fashionable.
These two curves are averages: Standard &amp; Poor, the blue one; and the red one is Standard &amp; Poor's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out.
In a way, it's the story of my life.
And I went from what's called real numbers, which are points on a line, to imaginary, complex numbers, which are points on a plane, which is what one should do there, and this shape came out.
This comes out repeatedly, again, again, again.
Two thousand and seven, five years ago, my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer, stage IIB.
Now, a simplistic answer would be, the doctors are doing this because they want to protect themselves legally.
And I'm going to share one of these studies with you today.
Simultaneously, it needs to be calm.
And you know that.
Yeah, so what we do if we had you, who will get the answer, as a participant, we would have calibrated the difficulty level of the puzzles to your expertise.
Okay, so you have 30 minutes now to solve these 15 puzzles.
You will be more likely to give up before the 30 minutes elapse compared to you.
You focus on the foregone option.
It has now been five years, slightly more than five years, and the good news, thank God, is that the cancer is still in remission.
The freedom to chose where to live, what to do, what to buy, what to sell, from whom, to whom, when and how.
And most of Africa's farmers are, by and large, small farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal.
The real question is, how can markets be developed in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists?
Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors?
And because of that, as grain changes hands -- and I've measured that it changes hands four, five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer -- every time it changes hands -- and I've seen this all over rural Africa -- it also changes sacks.
In fact, in my view, there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africa's farmers have to bear.
Nearly three years ago, I decided to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth, Ethiopia, after nearly 30 years abroad.
And in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan, rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms.
This is powered by low-cost VSAT technology, aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.
In our approach in Ethiopia, we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem, or environment, in which trade takes place.
Whereas before the farmer used to think local -- meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market, eight to 10 kilometers away on average, and sell whatever they happened to have, without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was -- now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.
We believe that this initiative requires great political will, and we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector, and really even the underlying legal framework.
The will is there.
Which is why I'll show you a threat, and an architectural response.
It was here in the late '60s and early '70s that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid, with about up to 250,000 dying.
That's a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously.
That's the kind of forced migration that desertification can lead to.
Now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won't get chopped down.
So, the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us.
He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.
So, we pushed the piles down through the dune, and we create an initial bacterial surface.
We see the result, the traces, if you like, of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments.
I was born in Poland, now in the U.S.
So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming.
So then I published the 3D designs, schematics, instructional videos and budgets on a wiki.
We've seen lots of excitement from these people, who can now start a construction business, parts manufacturing, organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid.
A few years ago, oddly enough, I needed the bathroom, and I found one, a public bathroom, and I went into the stall, and I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life: use the toilet, flush the toilet, forget about the toilet.
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet.
Where I come from, we call it Delhi belly, as a legacy of empire.
And the cost to the world is immense: 260 billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation.
So a toilet can put a girl back in school.
We don't keep them all.
Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff, and it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases.
They've found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that they've got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms with their owners happily walking past them and going over to the open defecating ground.
And she was horrified to get there and find that they didn't have a toilet.
She got her toilet, and now she goes around all the other villages in India persuading other women to do the same thing.
It cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life.
People go out and upgrade their toilet.
People came to study our reefs from Australia, which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs.
And the reason was because of overfishing, and the fact that a last common grazer, a sea urchin, died.
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod.
This picture here shows the trophy fish, the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat, go to a place off of Key West in Florida, drink a lot of beer, throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water, come back with the biggest and the best fish, and the champion trophy fish are put on this board, where people take a picture, and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish.
We use longlines that have one million or two million hooks.
And all of that stuff is really disgusting, but what's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems.
Now another form of pollution that's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients.
And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms.
Well, the Northwest Passage is already there.
And the algae give the corals sugar, and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection.
But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks, the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts.
That doesn't sell.
So the question is: Will we respond to this or not?
Still, America had gone saucer-mad, even famous scientists who were eating lunch.
One is that the aliens might be very far away.
For it is given in certain UFO-ology or UFOlogy circles, that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia; that they have walked among us in disguise, observing us, guiding our evolution from ape to man -- if you believe in that sort of thing -- and, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids.
That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child.
I did not know why they were teasing me.
Maybe it was swamp gas, but -- -- I know what I saw.
I didn't know her name, and I never will.
I did not even turn my head.
Except for the girl.
This book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller.
Does something seem strange about this to you?
The freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders, clustering into a kind of a tan.
I did not know where the beach was.
And he said, "Don't worry." He was sure that Catherine would be safe.
And even now, a decade and a half later, even now that we are married, I look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.
And recession, of course, isn't exactly a recipe for hope either, as we're busy finding out.
And I want to ask the question -- and we'll give them that two percent hike in income, in salary each year as well, because we believe in growth.
Maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere, which is what we're going to need to be doing by the end of the century.
Now investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies, but it plays an absolutely vital role.
It was above the GDP for three years in a row just before the crisis.
The first one is in the crisis itself.
So is it that, though they make perfect economic sense, we don't do them?
But actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me, because it suddenly became clear to me why we don't do the blindingly obvious things.
Or might we actually occasionally be something like the selfless altruist depicted in Rembrandt's lovely, lovely sketch here?
We've created systems, which systematically privilege, encourage, one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others unregarded.
Internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search.
It's a different kind of enterprise for a new economy.
And it's also clear that we will never achieve that unless we're capable of redefining a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations, a prosperity that is more meaningful and less materialistic than the growth-based model.
And at the heart of that economics, we're placing a more credible, more robust, and more realistic vision of what it means to be human.
Can I picture politicians doing it?
TJ: I would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century, in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere, and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water.
I can photograph it from any angle, and it will still look 2D.
But I didn't just want to paint the shadows.
I made the tough decision of going home after graduation and not going up to Capitol Hill, but going down to my parents' basement and making it my job to learn how to paint.
It just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself.
The napalm is burning there quite nicely.
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules.
If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.
When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics, it's absolutely explosive.
You might notice that many gas pumps, including this one, are designed to look like ATMs.
Well, the reason is, is because, when we're buying gas, we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance.
Okay, so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States.
It was terrifying; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now, imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s.
They really influence people.
This is why these moments of these oil spills are so important.
We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves; 65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf.
One of the places we put in a big oil project in Chad, with Exxon.
This is 1988 -- we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year.
Now on the one hand, the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil, but on the other hand, the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work, generally in a fairly crummy car.
The moratoriums are fine, but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil.
We have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies.
And at the same time, you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting, or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car, or whatever it is you're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence.
But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani, who is a contestant, indeed a finalist, in the Poet of the Millions competition, which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi, and seen throughout the Arab world.
We must go to watch "Afghan Star."
This has opened up the door, particularly for women.
And she's out there.
And the final, sort of, formulation of this "American Idol" format, which has just appeared in Afghanistan, is a new program called "The Candidate."
It's flipping freezing in that water.
The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake.
And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt. Everest, and I prepared myself the same way as I've always prepared myself, for this swim which was going to be so very difficult.
And I don't where I got it from, but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake.
Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army, about speed and aggression, you put that to one side.
And I can't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side.
And I ask you, please, to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make, which will make that big difference, and then commit a hundred percent to doing it.
This doesn't mean we should ignore software, or information, or computation."
So, this isn't my work, but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT.
And from the results of the same competition last year, a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on and off.
Can we get self-replicating-type behavior?
So we start with white, blue, blue, white.
So, why would you want to replicate bit strings?
Now, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that, and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure, and in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence. And now I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits.
So can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site?
I've seen this video, but I still don't know if it's going to end right.
Under a different load, it's a different structure. And you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor.
So, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things, so you end up with this sort of guy, right?
And so you want that to tow boats very fast.
And I think this is what we've done with climate change.
So if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet, we need to look somewhere else for the solution.
And since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place, suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable.
Now we may find that there are places that are really, really dense and still hold onto their cars, but the reality is that, by and large, what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect, where people simply stop driving as much, and increasingly, more and more people, if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home, give up their cars altogether.
Some of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet.
Okay. I do too.
We cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine.
And if we have another eight billion or seven billion, or six billion, even, people, living on a planet where their cities also steal the future, we're going to run out of future really fast.
Let me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 -- from the millennium scale to the year scale -- to try to persuade you of this. Until 10,000 years ago, all humans lived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlements or government. And this is the state that's commonly thought to be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley, looking at casualty rates among contemporary hunter-gatherers, which is our best source of evidence about this way of life, has shown a rather different conclusion.
There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment: burning at the stake, disemboweling, breaking on the wheel, being pulled apart by horses and so on.
Since the end of the Cold War, there have been fewer civil wars, fewer genocides -- indeed, a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs -- and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime.
Well, why has violence declined? No one really knows, but I have read four explanations, all of which, I think, have some grain of plausibility. The first is, maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." Not because, he argued, humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative, but because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy, there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively, before they invade you. More recently, Thomas Schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement. Being a good American, he has a pistol in the nightstand, pulls out his gun, and walks down the stairs.
So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory.
And there are a number of possibilities, such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for.
SP: My pleasure.
They like the generics.
Their marketing is slightly different.
I'm going to talk about your mindset.
So one girl said, very cleverly, "It's very easy.
It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap, water and food, you know, you can live long.
And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here.
There was less than five percent of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this.
And United States only had some, one, two thousand dollars at that time.
Or Google is quite generous, so he can have one or two years to go.
It's not really, really flat.
And this is the number of people.
But more or less, this is what will happen, and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided.
I heard that your departments here were by regions.
And here were are. We have a continuum in the world.
Many are not aware of -- no, this is not a joke.
And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor.
1900, Sweden was there.
And third chance for Sweden, against Brazil here.
It's the most tropical country in the world, a marshland on the equator.
We have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way.
There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa.
If I split Tanzania in its income, the richer 20 percent in Tanzania has more HIV than the poorest one.
It's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation.
That used to be the illegal diamond trade, from the UNITA-dominated area in Angola.
I've got to warn you: the sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle, sometimes even elusive.
By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas.
Now, first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are, to be on the brink of true global social organization.
Now, I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called "non-zero sumness."
I mean, there are certainly plenty of them around.
And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been, OK. This was not a prevalent view, few thousand years ago, and I attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic.
And I would say the non-zero-sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends, but more intense in a kind of negative way.
You could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes, but I think in something so spooky, we really shouldn't have the word positive there at all, even in a technical sense.
I never called myself Mr. Uplift.
So when they feel resentful, it's kind of like the way I feel resentful when this happens, and for somewhat the same reasons." That's true understanding.
Now, the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter.
It's going to be hard. I say we give it a shot anyway because we've just come too far to screw it up now.
The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems should be a massive increase in aid, something akin to the Marshall Plan.
And secondly, they are the smallest reality.
We should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war.
And in the process, none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes of Africa's fundamental problems.
AM: Thank you very much. But let me tell you this.
Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement, African countries that produce beef have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.
The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy, it lies with international donors.
It may have built a road, and that road may have served a very good role.
Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid, and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.
Public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.
Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament.
We'd really better give you a longer sound bite."
And by parallel summary, I want to say the same thing about technology, about entertainment and design, because I think the issues are very similar.
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses.
We forgot responsibility. That was the first cost.
It should be interested in the best things in life.
And how do they differ from the rest of us?
About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy.
That's what Aristotle was talking about.
And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst, who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him.
But what Mike told you yesterday -- during flow, you can't feel anything.
She's working her way through college.
This is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally.
Gratitude visit. I want you all to do this with me now, if you would.
But it's so heartening to be in a group like this, in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy.
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction.
So, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard, and so this was amazing for me. I've never been in a gathering like this.
But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic, and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph.
Shot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels.
Here's an example.
But this flashbulb memory, as it's called, is when all the elements came together to define not just the event, but my emotional connection to it.
The quality of these amateur photographs can, at times, be amazing.
This is a serval cat.
It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.
Annie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.
Sometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.
This is called fishing down the food chain.
The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home.
So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water.
So, she is pretty significant in size.
And she did this over the course of a couple of days, until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head.
In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced relatively little stress.
Basically, I've turned stress into the enemy.
You come into the laboratory, and you're told you have to give a five-minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you, and to make sure you feel the pressure, there are bright lights and a camera in your face, kind of like this.
Audience: Go faster. Faster please.
But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized, was preparing you to meet this challenge?
But in the study, when participants viewed their stress response as helpful, their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this.
And when you view stress in that way, your body believes you, and your stress response becomes healthier.
It enhances your empathy.
When life is difficult, your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you.
I want to finish by telling you about one more study.
How would that extend to advice, like, if someone is making a lifestyle choice between, say, a stressful job and a non-stressful job, does it matter which way they go?
Investments are being made, but at the current level, it's estimated it's going to take them 50 years to catch up.
That's the part that works.
The second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and fly farther, or pick up or deliver loads.
So they use GPS and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations.
We're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake.
When we saw this, we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world.
It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer, it's bidirectional, highly adaptable, with very low infrastructure investment, very low ecological footprint.
Over time, we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions, lifting millions of people out of poverty.
And we're going to try to do a photo-real face of an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there.
Now, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit, we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in, and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point.
If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily, you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions.
We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here.
Emily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.
We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6, and we're looking at taking this technology and applying it to whole human bodies.
And my father was a soldier, and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher.
And the training center there was built around the scientific Congolese staff and some American scientists also.
I joined the Wildlife Conservation Society, working there, in 1995, but I started working with them as a student in 1991.
Congo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area, and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them.
You can't ask him how old he is because he has guns.
I stayed after they looted everything.
They came to told me, I have to save him.
He's not collecting plants, he's going to save our equipment on the canopy.
This time I think Kabila will go in place of, as he did with Mobutu.
But I was doing that, negotiating with them.
They started suspecting that what we do on the morning, and the afternoon, it's on the news, BBC, RFI.
So, it was a chance that they trusted me a lot.
This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this.
I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium, because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants.
This is a very embarrassing talk, I know.
See what the wars in Rwanda.
How can we help you?
One of the things that's changed here, in the last 150 years since Jules Verne had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like, is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about.
From the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave.
So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.
Eventually, if you keep going down in these things, probability says that you're going to run into a place like this.
So it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range, away from a safe haven.
This is Europa.
The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.
This is part of DEPTHX's mission.
The successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots.
Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.
Thus, every time you'd want to do anything in space, you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator.
The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground, and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.
When you're coming back from the moon, you have to deal with orbital mechanics.
This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.
We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater, to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.
Thank you.
It's happening, the recourse to market mechanisms and market thinking and market solutions, in bigger arenas.
One of them has to do with inequality.
They've tried this, actually.
Let's see by a show of hands.
HM: Well, the intrinsic motivation should be to learn.
HM: To be frank, I just think this is, not to offend anyone, a very American way.
Economists often assume that markets are inert, that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange.
In fact, during the past three decades, when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige, our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out, empty of larger moral meaning.
That's a Boeing 707.
If innovation is less powerful, invents less great, wonderful things, then growth is going to be even lower than half of history.
But you know what the actual facts are?
You'll notice that in 1891, over on the left, we were at about 5,000 dollars.
But now it's turned around.
And that gets us down from the 1.5, where we've reached for education, down to 1.3.
They created pollution, they created odors, they were hard to control, the light was dim, and they were a fire hazard.
The whole thing took two days out of the seven-day week.
So it's a truism that things can't be more than 100 percent of themselves.
The earliest cell phones, the earliest personal computers were invented in the 1970s.
So here we are back to the horse and buggy.
So, I also want to explain, because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.
And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago, but it was during the time I was writing my last book, and some people say that book is quite different.
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had, and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.
There was a reason for everything.
Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300, you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen, in what order they happen. What are the influences?
And they all operate at the same time.
And it's what Buddhist fishermen say, because they're not supposed to kill anything.
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.
And when I have the question, it is a focus.
It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as I said, human rights in Burma.
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable, and I consider what my intentions should be, I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life, and what is my place in the universe?
And I needed to find something historically that would match that.
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place, and we ended up in this non-tourist location, a beautiful village, pristine.
And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.
And I began to sense something different about the history, and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village, and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links with other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.
I believe in specifics, the specifics of story, and the past, the specifics of that past, and what is happening in the story at that point.
And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story -- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think, to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.
Now, before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s I wonder what they said?
That people who can spread ideas, regardless of what those ideas are, win.
And that model of, and we heard it yesterday, if we could only get onto the homepage of Google, if we could only figure out how to get promoted there, if we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat, and tell them about what we want to do.
100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff -- all so I could ignore every single message.
And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow, and you keep driving because you've seen cows before.
That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a 55,000-dollar giant car, big enough to hold a mini in its trunk.
And the thing is, people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business -- they're used to it.
They didn't want to buy his bread. It didn't look like "French bread."
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you.
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends.
It's as loud as a 747 jet. You can't get in the car; it's got bulletproof glass on the windows because they'll blow out the windshield otherwise.
Hard Candy nail polish, doesn't appeal to everybody, but to the people who love it, they talk about it like crazy.
Proctor and Gamble knows this, right?
Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk -- not milk.
Who is going to raise their hand and say, "I want to hear what you're doing next," and sell something to them.
I don't know about you but if they build it, that's where I'm going to go.
Now, in January, 2011, the revolution started, and life stopped for 18 days, and on the 12th of February, we naively celebrated on the streets of Cairo, believing that the revolution had succeeded.
No to blinding heroes. Ahmed Harara lost his right eye on the 28th of January, and he lost his left eye on the 19th of November, by two different snipers.
Another artist comes, paints the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank.
But I'm moving past Malthus, because I think that we just might be about 150 years from a kind of new enlightenment.
So human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days.
And instead, they'll be planning for the future and starting to build the 22nd Century Enlightenment.
The story I wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to engage in courtship, mating and to have their pups.
The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms.
So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis, in part because I had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years, but also because I read a scientific paper that stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years.
If we weren't so efficient at catching them, because they grow their entire life, would have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton.
And this just drags over the bottom, in this case to catch shrimp.
But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net.
But it's an animal that's about 98 percent in decline throughout most of its range.
After I left Bimini, I actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort.
This is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey.
Now, both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early whalers, but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they're located in places farther away from human activity.
They hold on to them, and it eventually kills them.
You know, I read that the pilgrims, when they landed at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts in 1620, wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay on the backs of right whales.
But when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population, low and behold, kelp forests emerged in shallow water.
And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years, and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the 1960s.
The deforestation, especially for oil palm, to provide biofuel for Western countries is what's causing these problems.
So we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started.
Still, four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people.
Still, in this place, in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill, four years later, there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ...
You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control, whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice.
So if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again.
March.
We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year; they lost 12 IQ points. It was a disaster for orangutans and people.
So, just like nature, we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that, we grow the slower growing, primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light. Then, what is just as important: get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves, bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours.
It's only a small part of the area.
And finally, the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income.
Cloud cover -- I'm going to show it to you -- is up.
You measure how the trees grow back, but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back.
If you look at rainfall, it was already up 20 percent at that time.
This is how it looks.
And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like.
You have no idea how much time I spend.
Tule is a reed that's native to California, and the best thing about working with it is that it smells just delicious.
This is very early rehearsal footage, but the finished work's on tour and is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks.
I have a two-year-old daughter who's the best thing ever.
Some of them are like the wind and some are like waves, and sometimes they look alive and sometimes they seem like math.
The very moment I turned it on, I hated it.
During many years, I made some speeches starting with this saying: "City is not a problem, it's a solution."
And most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city.
And now there's 83 cities all over the world that they are doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba.
And for handicapped, they can use this as a normal system.
And 23 years after, they called us to develop -- we're developing this idea.
And the children, we teach during six months how to separate their garbage.
We don't rip our family portrait, even if we don't like the nose of our uncle, because this portrait is you.
Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks.
And we cannot have all the answers.
Can we put yours online?" And I said, "Sure."
Actually, I kind of divide the world into two groups now.
Because it isn't what they do, it's who they are. They say, "But this is me, you know.
Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough.
I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time.
I love that word, "disenthrall."
That's not what I think you take for granted, I'm sure you're familiar with that already.
They see no reason to do this.
One of them is the idea of linearity: that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right, you will end up set for the rest of your life.
He said I was throwing my life away if that's all I chose to do with it; that I should go to college, I should become a professional person, that I had great potential and I was wasting my talent to do that."
about nine years ago, I came across a policy statement -- very well-intentioned -- which said, "College begins in kindergarten."
"You've achieved nothing -- commit.
I think we have to recognize a couple of things here.
Often, people are good at things they don't really care for.
We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process.
And I urge you to get involved in it because it's vital, not just to ourselves, but to the future of our children.
He says this: "Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths, Enwrought with gold and silver light, The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light, I would spread the cloths under your feet: But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams."
"Yesterday I thought."
What's the origin of this?
The reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace.
Fight back? Give in?
There's something terrible happening."
And what I've discovered since is this: Bullies use violence in three ways.
And what I need to develop is self-knowledge to do that.
And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun, put her hand on it and lower it.
I got up, made the cup of tea, sat down with it, did it all and I'm here -- still partly paralyzed, but I'm here.
It's okay to be angry with the thing -- the nuclear weapons in this case -- but it is hopeless to be angry with the people.
It's people joining up with people, as Bundy just said, miles away to bring about change.
So the training of the troops has to change.
In the moment, that's what he did.
And it's being used by young people and older people everywhere, because it works and it's effective.
And we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as strengthening this incredible resolve.
Do you mind if we do something completely different?
It was a place where nothing very much had happened.
This is a place, in a way, that I just would like you to, in a way, look at differently because of this event that has happened in it, a human event, and in general, it just asks us to look again at this world, so different from, in a way, the world that we have been sharing with each other, the technological world, to look again at the elemental world.
This is a work called "Learning To See."
Can we use, in a way, a body as an empty catalyst for a kind of empathy with the experience of space-time as it is lived, as I am standing here in front of you trying to feel and make a connection in this space-time that we are sharing, can we use, at it were, the memory of a body, of a human space in space to catalyze an experience, again, firsthand experience, of elemental time.
Again, the darkness of the body, now held within this bunker shape of the minimum position that a body needs to occupy, a crouching body.
As you walk towards the ever-open threshold, you disappear, both to yourselves and to others.
If art has any purpose, it is to open our eyes to that fact."
Take nothing: do no harm.
Now, the mathematically-minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact -- a bad thing -- but T in the denominator decreases impact.
And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes, and get rid of T1 altogether, we could reduce our impact to zero, including our impact on the climate.
Water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business.
It is practical, and pretty too.
Our products are the best they've ever been, inspired by design for sustainability, an unexpected wellspring of innovation.
We literally gained market share.
Well maybe so. But I don't think so.
Not you. Not I.
The continuum of humanity, sure, but in a larger sense, the web of life itself.
You know, frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology.
Expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts -- which have set curtain times, set venues, attendant inconveniences of travel, parking and the like -- simply cannot meet.
And for those of you who love the arts, aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day?
And now who in this room doesn't know a 14 year-old hard at work on her second, third, or fourth movie?
Ultimately, we now live in a world defined not by consumption, but by participation.
You know, we've said for a long time, we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town.
I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work, whatever your purpose may be.
I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living.
And that's how I got out of high school.
Manchester Craftsmen's Guild is named after my neighborhood.
As you can see, it has a fountain in the courtyard.
That's intentional.
And we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there."
And he called me into his office -- which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz -- and John Heinz had 600 million dollars, and at the time I had about 60 cents.
And most importantly, he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company.
It looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town in America.
And so you must ask yourself the question: how is it possible in the 21st century that we graduate children from schools who can't read the diplomas that they have in their hands?
And last year I put 88 percent of those kids in college and I've averaged over 80 percent for 15 years.
We teach photography.
I can't get these parents to come to the school."
And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school, they've got four shows on their resume before they apply to college because it's all up here.
She said, "Well, I work for a company called Hewlett-Packard."
And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here, Marty Ashby.
So, we've become one of the hot, young jazz recording studios in the United States of America in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate.
And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson, who recorded that album at our school last Christmas.
Every building has a fountain.
So, the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city.
The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams, just in case they do come true.
And that weekend, I was going back home and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night -- first time I'd met him.
And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay and we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got Herbie on the board, and our friends from HP, and our friends from Steelcase, and our friends from Cisco, and our friends from Wells Fargo and Genentech.
I said, "Hey man, what is eBay?"
And Quincy said, "Where did the idea for centers like this come from?"
In Pennsylvania it costs 60,000 dollars to keep people in jail, most of whom look like me.
You're always fighting upstream like a salmon -- never enough money, too much need -- and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work.
and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina, diseases like macular degeneration, and there's little that can be done for them.
Like this pattern of pulses here actually means "baby's face," and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses, it knows that what was out there was a baby's face, and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was, say, a dog, or another pattern would be a house.
And so the encoder does just what I was saying: it mimics the actions of the front-end circuitry -- so it takes images in and converts them into the retina's code.
And so, in a way, the equations are serving as sort of a codebook. An image comes in, goes through the set of equations, and out comes streams of electrical pulses, just like a normal retina would produce.
So what we did is we took a moment in time from these recordings and asked, what was the retina seeing at that moment?
So they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of DNA.
Well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life.
The question we had is how could they do anything at all?
What was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light, but when the bacteria made light.
That's how bioluminescence works -- they're talking with these chemical words.
And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom -- which is made by the bacterium -- exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back, so the squid doesn't make a shadow.
And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule.
It's not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins -- you're enormous, that would have no effect on you. You're huge.
Anywhere on your body, it looks pretty much like this, and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there.
Then again we turn to chemistry, and we figured out what this generic molecule is -- that was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.
Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics?
And so they lock into those receptors, and they jam recognition of the real thing.
What we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections, but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules -- so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing, but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide.
We think, by studying bacteria, we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body.
So, we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better.
I want to thank you for inviting me here.
Who should get the best ones?
Why?
We'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music.
Now, flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case.
He sued, and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court, believe it or not, the case over the golf cart, because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated, provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity.
And how many would not? How many would say he doesn't?
Audience: The cart's not part of the game.
Who has an answer for Charlie?
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf.
Now, there were two dissenters, one of whom was Justice Scalia.
If we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary, rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring, we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game.
Let me put the point as delicately as possible: Golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game.
And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no, procreation is not the only purpose of marriage; what about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment?
Thank you.
Well, I think that it is possible.
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit, so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point where I get this thing to work.
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.
It's not just about life, of course -- -- it's about healthy life, you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun.
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, is what I say.
And, I say that that's fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem.
So basically, metabolism, which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next, has side effects.
We've discovered things like, for example, RNA interference only a few years ago, and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer."
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 -- and an average 80-year-old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies, because you're too close to death's door for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.
And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question, and it's extremely hard to answer.
They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.
We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage.
We know that this threshold exists, because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age, even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.
Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.
And we'll just end with a few things.
And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there.
In other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging; you need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly, and that carries on being true the longer you push it out.
So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.
But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things.
Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone.
So let me share with you our values.
Last, but not least, we believe in profit with principles.
But I'm more of the revolutionary, and I should be; I'm from Iceland.
That night she won the election, because she came back -- not just because of his crappy behavior -- but she came back and said, "Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation; I'm going to lead it."
That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future.
And what I work for, and to do, is to make our cities more walkable.
What happens when a city decides it's going to set other priorities?
So if they're not spending that money on driving -- and by the way, 85 percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy -- if they're not spending that money on driving, what are they spending it on?
Again, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then, back in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese.
Some people gained weight, some people didn't gain weight.
We're pretty safe here.
Was it designed around cars or around people?
But, of course, we've seen what that does.
Canadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities.
We've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers, and you should do the same thing, but changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week.
The driving cities in the Sun Belt, the Dallases and the Phoenixes and, sorry, Atlanta, these cities are not appearing on the list.
I take some solace from Winston Churchill, who put it this way: "The Americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives."
And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard through the conference right from the first day, where I heard that all the important statistics have been given -- about where we are now, about how the continent is doing much better.
Because we are confronted with a challenge.
One of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue.
So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this, including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.
Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent, much of what you have seen here.
So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.
For the army -- my father joined the army as a brigadier -- the Biafran army.
My father was not there.
I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.
You don't care what it is!
That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated.
Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today.
And one day, these foundations have so much money, they will overtake the official aid that is being given.
And now I'm maybe being harsh.
This is what gives us the hopeless image.
So our problem right now is, how can we leverage all this good will that is coming towards our way?
That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market.
Let's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership.
And we know, studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman -- in fact, there's an econometric study, the World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that transfers into the hands of women result in healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.
She needs another 20 million.
Now by 2010, as well, popular design magazines were also beginning to take a closer look at cities like Detroit, and devoting whole issues to "fixing the city."
Many of them step very firmly to the mic, put their hands across their chest, and go, "I know you people are trying to move me out of my house, right?"
During that same period, between 1950 and 2000, 2010, the city loses 60 percent of its population, and today it hovers at above 700,000.
So if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property and we smush it together, it looks like about 20 square miles, and that's roughly equivalent to the size of the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan, at 22 square miles.
This company, Shinola, which is a luxury watch and bicycle company, deliberately chose to relocate to Detroit, and they quote themselves by saying they were drawn to the global brand of Detroit's innovation.
I will say though that, after having done surgery a lot, it's somewhat similar to playing a musical instrument.
I've always -- just as a listener, as just a fan -- I listen to that, and I'm just astounded.
In fact, they seem to be very unmusical entirely and to miss the whole point of the music.
I ask questions about what is this brain doing to enable us to do this.
And it's been used since the '90s to study really complex processes.
So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard?
So in the end, it's not the most natural environment, but they're able to play real music.
And so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity.
It's kind of fun actually.
CL: At this point, I'll take a few moments.
Now when I think about improvisation and the language, well what's next?
So I told my lab members that I would rap for TED, and they said, "No, you won't."
He doesn't know what's coming.
Emmanuel: Top of the beat with no repeat Rhythm and rhyme make me complete Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic Spittin' rhymes that'll hit you like a lightning strike I search for the truth in this eternal quest I'm passing on fashion; you can see how I'm dressed CL: Okay. So I'm going to stop that there. So what do we see in his brain?
Now, if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics, then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country.
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics, they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college.
And what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain, our center for control and experience.
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves.
And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional EEG system, this headset only costs a few hundred dollars.
And the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain, because every brain is different.
So once we accept this, the cube is live.
Okay. Let's try that.
So, as you can see, before, there is a leveling system built into this software so that as Evan, or any user, becomes more familiar with the system, they can continue to add more and more detections, so that the system begins to differentiate between different distinct thoughts.
And finally, to real life-changing applications, such as being able to control an electric wheelchair.
This is one of the ways that vaccines are carried: These are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people, but they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks.
The other idea is kind of interesting, which is, you can't reach inside anymore.
And there's no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the people involved.
You can distribute bed nets, and bed nets are very effective if you use them.
One does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works: You take a drop of blood, you put it in there and it automatically tells you.
So this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond.
One of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you don't know what's the most effective thing to do.
We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data.
The United States did.
Now, in our company, this is what we call "the pinky-suck moment."
Now, it actually gets better than this.
Audience: Yeah!
Now, that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine, and let me show you how it works.
So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this, and we're looking very hard at how to make it highly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world.
So, that's what I have. Thanks very much.
It grows and is nurtured.
If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did, and that shows all the customers my products.
It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.
Three compost bins -- go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week -- really good, makes fantastic compost.
I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse.
The air handling system inside it -- I got rid of air-conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there.
There's no accident in names of these restaurants.
So people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class -- or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.
I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse and recycle -- right at the end there -- recycling is the last point I want to make; but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's -- then I think we're going to be on our way.
Allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes.
"Two boys hit me today in school.
It came into focus that those kids did not mean to be rude to my son.
I looked it up, and he was right.
I started receiving threats to be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign.
I didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya — it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house — and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off, but I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying, "No, I'm leaving today."
And the study states, the percentage of rape, adultery, illegitimate children, even drug abuse, prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don't drive.
Ah, it's okay. This is my favorite.
Ninety percent said yes, she's a traitor.
I would listen to what they say, and I would never defend myself with words only.
The Grand Mufti, who is the head of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia, he said, it's not recommended for women to drive.
So the question I started my talk with, who do you think is more difficult to face, oppressive governments or oppressive societies?
So the first of those projects ended up being something I called "One Second Every Day."
You know, this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done.
It was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life, just driving around the U.S. and Canada and just figuring out where to go the next day, and it was kind of outstanding.
Personally, I'm tired of forgetting, and this is a really easy thing to do.
And they should survive over there, on their own, in the future.
This is the wave, going from left to right. You can see this one.
In fact, it's a new invention of the wheel.
And that stuff, you see, is going to it the other way.
Here, we have the brain of the animal.
And the nose is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.
We did Haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism, that of Mycoplasma genitalium.
When we started this out, we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem, which is why we chose the smallest genome.
We didn't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there.
And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them.
But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end, and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence.
We felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic DNA from natural DNA.
The first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code.
And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote: "What I cannot build, I cannot understand."
It's significant to us.
But the thing is, how come it's news to most people?
I knew enough, that is, to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran -- an informed one, an experienced one even, but still an outsider, an agnostic Jew reading some else's holy book.
And I began to grasp why it's said that the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic.
Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers.
Old-fashioned Orientalism comes into play here.
Paradise is quite the opposite.
They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens, and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers.
And they forage maybe for about 20 meters away, gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest, and store them.
They go out, they get the food, they dig the nest, and the queen never comes out again.
So it starts out with zero ants, just the founding queen, and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five.
When it rains in the summer, it floods in the desert.
It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings of the Hopi people that are in that area.
And when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep as the colony is wide, so about a meter deep for the big old nests.
And curiously, and interestingly, it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing.
And once they belong to the ants that work outside, they never go back down.
So I did experiments where I changed one thing.
But not every transition is possible. And this shows how it works.
When I do these experiments with older colonies -- so ones that are five years or older -- they're much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic. The worse things get, the more I hassle them, the more they act like undisturbed colonies.
And what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact.
But if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers, I'm less likely to forage.
This is taken through a fiber optics microscope. It's down inside the nest.
Because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside.
And one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns -- this network of interaction patterns -- to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies.
That's the life everyone sees.
And so because we don't see it, we don't see the severity of it.
You would be wrong. So I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and I thought about taking my own life and I came this close to doing it.
I thought about it every single day, and if I'm being totally honest, standing here I've thought about it again since, because that's the sickness, that's the struggle, that's depression, and depression isn't chicken pox.
That's the stigma, because unfortunately, we live in a world where if you break your arm, everyone runs over to sign your cast, but if you tell people you're depressed, everyone runs the other way.
I wish I did, but I don't -- but I think, I think it has to start here.
And know that you're sick, you're not weak, and it's an issue, not an identity, because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others, you can see depression for what it really is, and that's just a part of life, just a part of life, and as much as I hate, as much as I hate some of the places, some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to, in a lot of ways I'm grateful for it.
So we need to stop the ignorance, stop the intolerance, stop the stigma, and stop the silence, and we need to take away the taboos, take a look at the truth, and start talking, because the only way we're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together, by standing strong together.
This first one, Internet Zero, up here -- this is a web server that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag -- about a dollar -- that can go in every light bulb and doorknob, and this is getting commercialized very quickly.
This is showing making bits, this is showing -- once again, slowed down so you can see it, bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing.
All the intelligence is external to the system; the materials don't have information.
Laser micro-machining: essentially 3D printers that digitally fabricate functional systems, all the way up to building buildings, not by having blueprints, but having the parts code for the structure of the building.
They were there because they wanted to make stuff.
This student made a web browser for parrots -- lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots.
So, with that, in turn, 20 million dollars today does this; 20 years from now we'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything.
So, in place after place we saw this same progression: that we'd open one of these Fab Labs, where we didn't -- this is too crazy to think of.
And I've shown this to engineers at big companies, and they say they can't do this. Any one thing she's doing, they can do better, but it's distributed over many people and many sites and they can't do in an afternoon what this little girl in rural Ghana is doing.
In the same sense we are now, today, in the minicomputer era of digital fabrication.
But we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects.
So, we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication, where the output of computation programs the physical world.
It wasn't. It was 1928.
So here you are, that the cost of all this to the world is 89 million barrels of oil, give or take a few barrels, every day.
We are policing the world, and how are we doing that?
They just move back to the Mid-East and those come back.
Yes, it's going to continue.
There is no free market for oil.
It comes out of the ground at 130 octane.
Look at the bar on the left. It's 24 trillion.
There are eight million of them.
I'm back to theorist again.
Thanks for that.
So what happened was that, through increased ability to use fracking technology, the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded and the price plummeted, which made wind uncompetitive.
I'm a geologist, got out of school in '51, and I've been in the industry my entire life.
See but again, I told you, I don't have to worry with that.
The government is not successful on these things.
And now I think reformers are safe.
We've got a little bit of accent incompatibility here, you know.
Never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else.
TBP: How do we get there?
How in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point?
I think there's a lot of people who will want to engage with you.
People would get very excited about this when they read these articles.
These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what, if you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing, no matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold.
They turned the ships into hotels, because they couldn't sail them anywhere.
And they didn't plan right.
: Bride #1: You said you had a large selection of invitations. Clerk: But we do.
Here's this guy: "There are many men in Dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed.
It's an incredible means of coordinating, in a very fine-grained way, information flows.
This is work going on down in lower Manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations.
This is the electric tie press, which never really did catch on.
So this was -- remember, they didn't wire the houses for electricity.
And there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning.
That's what you did. You didn't turn it off.
This is what it looks like under my desk.
They have to -- typically, they come three times.
That's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it, but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are.
And I think that's where we are.
I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy.
It's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion.
Now, there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism, which I think is kind of good news, which is that the way that this is played out in the human species, it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule.
We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison.
And it's natural to do that.
It's about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games.
And in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games.
Okay. So, now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world.
If they get less and less happy, that will be bad for Americans.
Because, you know, historically, if you're not being respected, you're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum, mutually profitable relationship with people.
And if you tell them, "Well, they think America disrespects them and even wants to dominate them, and they hate America.
It's their great calling right now, to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations, appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat.
But like every scientist, she appreciated that to make her mark, what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it.
Had they consumed colored drinks?
Nevertheless, Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956.
She worked with a statistician named George Kneale, and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn't.
And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds.
Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke, afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage, and felt that they were bound to lose.
He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people.
So now Joe had allies. They could think together.
I think it's a fantastic system, but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people, and way too late in life.
Let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you.
It's the first working prototype of the clock.
And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for.
It's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad.
That's a 2,000-foot thick formation, and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock.
The labyrinth is a concept, it's like a twilight zone, it's a place where it's difficult, where you get disoriented, maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration.
And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff.
What do you look for?
The wood is so solid it's like stone, and it lasts for a long time.
Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right.
And shale is not quite completely competent rock.
And so one Tuesday morning last June, there we were.
Let's go to approaches.
And from where you're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley, it's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet.
I don't want him killed. I know he's going to love cliffs.
We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered.
You can get another angle on Danny's porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there.
That's what it looks like looking down it.
This is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest.
You excavated from somewhere, came up from inside and deepened it.
Now, the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything.
So, let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that and how I went about it.
Somewhere between 10 trillion to 70 trillion cells in his body.
You will have cancer all over you. And you're not.
So, they put the cells in cultures, chicken cells, dumped the virus on it, and it would pile up, and they would say, this is malignant and this is normal.
The normal example, let's take the human mammary gland.
They completely forget.
I said, if it's true that architecture is dominant, architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it's normal.
We can revert the malignant phenotype.
But before we do that, I'd like you to think that at any given time when you're sitting there, in your 70 trillion cells, the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus, the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix and this is how your balance is kept and restored.
So, we have now made an amazing discovery, a post-doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me, what do the cells do when you put them in?
Absolutely boggles my mind.
So it's like form and function.
And I'd like to submit to you that we have sequenced the human genome, we know everything about the sequence of the gene, the language of the gene, the alphabet of the gene, But we know nothing, but nothing, about the language and alphabet of form.
Let's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you, in the last 24 hours -- think back -- have told a little fib, or a big one? How many have told a little lie out there?
Let's start with the Butlers. Here's an example of one: "On my way." Anybody ever written, "On my way?"
And so these lies are being used by people to create a buffer, like the butler used to do, between us and the connections to everybody else.
My favorite, by Nicodemus Jones, is, "Whatever else it might do, it will touch your soul."
Now, let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms, which I'm sure none of you have been in.
Again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most, and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about.
All right, well, what about online dating?
Now, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line.
It's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.
Let's turn to now, the networked age.
You remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before? Well, when they write a fake review, they have to post it somewhere, and it's left behind for us.
And how many of you think that B is?
They were inserting themselves into the hotel review, kind of trying to convince you they were there.
Well, let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas, I believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind.
Thank you so much for your time, and good luck with your record.
Man 6: Holy [beep]! That is awesome.
He needs help getting 10 million dollars.
This project has lasted now, been just over two years.
I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment.
I have, like, a thing about sleeping.
But I do that all the time.
I don't get necessarily inspired by research.
I'm very, very, very inspired by movies.
So that's what I do. I study color a lot.
And there were times when I was actually so desperate I would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, "Eric!"
That's the name of the show, they eat out, they -- that's on my tombstone when I die.
Except, I guess, that's what staying up every night is about.
I'd been very ingrained in the dance world since I was a teenager.
I went to Parsons School of Design and then I began my career as a designer.
And she makes all the deals.
Hi there.
Cutting hair? Never, never.
Because just because if you're fabulously rich, and fabulously famous, does that mean you shouldn't have kids, because you know they're going to end up getting messed up?
I forgot that I said that. But it's really true.
So check this out.
IM: I have to tell you, I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time.
Let me tell you something interesting.
The liquid is actually that clear liquid.
Happy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it.
An identity was defined primarily by religion.
But actually it's my belief that the people who've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior, up until now, up until recent times, up until the last six months, the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational allegiances, using digital activism and other sorts of borderless technologies, those who've been benefiting from this have been extremists.
But the way in which I learned to use technology to my advantage was because I was within an extremist organization that was forced to think beyond the confines of the nation-state.
In certain countries, mosque minarets are being banned.
If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot: there's a man called Anwar al-Awlaki.
And a social movement is comprised, in my view, it's comprised of four main characteristics.
And that's the power of social movements.
I believe, number one, it's complacency.
So democracy has become merely one political choice among many other forms of political choices available in those societies.
Well statistically, the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated.
What we'll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here -- the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy, not for a democracy.
Because it's not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator.

What matters here isn't technical capital, it's social capital.
The first one is the famous one, the printing press: movable type, oil-based inks, that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned Europe upside-down, starting in the middle of the 1400s.
If you want to have a conversation in this world, you have it with one other person.
The second big change is that, as all media gets digitized, the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media, meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet, magazines migrate to the Internet, movies migrate to the Internet.
Second story.
And within half a day donation sites were up, and donations were pouring in from all around the world.
Someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose.
The media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs.
Bundle up the message. Send the same message to everybody.
But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of.
He had said, in January, that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons.
I understand where you are coming from.
It is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups.
You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.
This is a view of base camp.
When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze; you can't even see over the top.
It's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall.
What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit.
This is not good weather to climb in, so the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.
The summit would be in the foreground.
OK, this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself.
They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain; all the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting.
But they did what they could to stabilize the people.
The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated, I would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain.
His wife was home in New Zealand, seven months pregnant with their first child, and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done, and Rob and his wife had their last conversation.
The survivors came in one by one.
So he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.
And then he said to himself, "I don't want to die.
So let's take a cut through the brain here, and imagine that Beck was hooked up to a SPECT scan.
He's beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up.
He's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now.
He was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients; luckily, we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys.
And one more climber should have died that day, but didn't, and that's Beck Weathers.
And today, after the global economic crisis, there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene.
Now in India's case I believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today.
What is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend.
When India got independence entrepreneurs were seen as a bad lot, as people who would exploit.
But today, as Indian companies go abroad, as Indians come and work all over the world, Indians have gained a lot more confidence and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in.
And really there are four things here.
Those of you who have been to India have seen that.
For a long time we have neglected our cities.
These four factors I believe -- the ones of primary education, infrastructure, urbanization, and single market -- in my view are ideas in India which have been accepted, but not implemented.
This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved.
As a result of that our higher education is simply not keeping pace with India's demands.
So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with a set of rich country diseases.
If we really want to come to a point, we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission, we want to really lower the use of energy -- it has to be solved in countries like India.
Three years ago, I got a phone call, based on an earlier film I had made, with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.
And he knew me, so I was like, "Greg?"
So what that meant was, when I went down to Fort Dix, I had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision.
Michael Moriarty: Specialist Michael Moriarty.
MM: Every single time you go out there, there's attacks.
MM: They're shooting at me.
Soldiers: Sergeant Smith is down! Sergeant Smith is down?
And you know, Paul was talking, and he then turned to Constance and said, "You know, I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here, because I know she has my back."
But there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages that I was able to save.
Whoa.
SP: Sheriff one-six, or any one-four elements, we need you at the gate of Taji right now, over.
I don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down.
If one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment, I would've slit his throat right there.
Another mission at 06:00.
So, I pinged Mike and I said, "Mike, can you please go get that interview with Pink?"
So, when you may hear soldiers complaining, that's what they're talking about, you know?
I get -- I'm often asked, you know, for me, what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film.
He's a big guy.
I haven't been able to tell my wife.
You go and see anybody?
Thank you.
As you have been told, I'm Bulgarian.
You know who to arrest, who to negotiate with.
And the first thing that went right was, of course, these five revolutions which, in my view, very much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience.
And you have the Internet.
All this was very much under attack.
Now the elites basically have been liberated.
And when you go to the brain sciences, what political consultants learned from the brain scientists is don't talk to me about ideas anymore, don't talk to me about policy programs.
Because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most.
This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent.
And I do believe that when we're discussing politics these days, probably it makes sense to look also at this type of a story.
Now, of course, we care about the social value.
Socially motivated investors: there's an interesting idea, right?
So we get paid for crimes saved.
Instead of just coming out of the prison with 46 pounds in their pocket, half of them not knowing where they're spending their first night out of jail, actually, someone meets them in prison, learns about their issues, meets them at the gate, takes them through to somewhere to stay, connects them to benefits, connects them to employment, drug rehabilitation, mental health, whatever's needed.
Essex only pays in the event that it's saving them care costs.
It enables testing of new ideas in a way that's less difficult for everybody.
The last element is partnership.
But anyway, this is about the evils of science, so I think it's perfect.
I go, "You're the driver, you should know."He goes, "No, I just arrived, sir."
Yeah. The Middle East is going crazy.
I told him, I said, "No, no, no, I was just in Lebanon."
I need to rest."
Think about it. You never see us laughing in American film or television, right?
I'm not supposed to be, like, walking down the aisle, and be like, "Hi, Jack." You know, that's not cool.
Just as you're walking down: "[Imitating Arabic] -- strawberry!"
We're going to take it back, way back, back into time.
Party, party, yeah.
All right boys, take it away.
And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2, 52 percent are tied to buildings.
But our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.
The exciting thing is, look at the faces of the people.
You probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times.
So my hope is that when you leave TED, you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it.
One is the focused ultrasound, and the other one is the vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging.
And you know also about lithotripsy -- breaking kidney stones.
And there was something fundamental that they were missing.
John is a retired professor of history from Virginia.
We attach a transducer, in this case, to the brain, but if it will be a different organ, it will be a different transducer attached to the patient.
This is the only device he needs in this treatment.
This is really a unique capability of the MR.
This is the outcome from a patient perspective -- same day after the treatment.
I mean, those people lose their independence.
Many patients like that favor radiation therapy.
He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly.
I don't see, without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen, it will not happen.
And this will take time.
She was offered a hysterectomy, but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option.
I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada.
You might also be asking whether it's possible that this is illegal for her to do this.
Canal Street, I know.
So, one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying, which is really what it is, is the establishment of trends.
If you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand?
But even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects, can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend.
I tell you, there is no rest for the fashionable.
I don't know if you've heard this anecdote, but I have.
But now, we have a different kind of comic.
In Japan, for instance, which I think is the third largest market, they have a design law; it protects apparel, but the novelty standard is so high, you have to prove that your garment has never existed before, it's totally unique.
But this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg.
They share their designs.
When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries that didn't have copyright protection, I thought, "What exactly is the underlying logic?
Is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society?
I'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay.
It also happens to be a relative of parsley.
So it was the slow churn, if you will.
But luckily, it worked out obviously, but it was a humbling experience to feel so disconnected.
So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus, I got some maps and some GPS coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings, the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees.
This is the spruce Gran Picea, which at 9,550 years is a mere babe in the woods.
And then, you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached 405 years old.
It's around 2,000, and it's called the Sagole Baobab.
It's a primitive conifer.
That way, when a fire roars through, it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed.
And you see it has that similar circular form.
It's also probably one the most vulnerable of the oldest living things, because if the permafrost melts, it won't survive.
Thank you.
All you do, go into the timeline, double-click the item, and I've set it to Toronto, because that's where I'm from.
That means it's completely remixable. It also means there's no proprietary software. All you need is a web browser.
They have taught me a lot, and I'd like to be able to share some of these observations with you.
Think about the infrastructure to build it.
What was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them.
The innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and over the government.
"Yes, yes, yes," came the answers.
Think about what happened.
There are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit.
Every time a new technology is being introduced, criminals are there to exploit it.
But as these get bigger in the future, what other items will you be able to print?
That's troubling, since the human body itself is now becoming an information technology.
It's a great challenge for them.
The technologies got better, and now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of Moore's Law.
Personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons, which means you can attack any one individual, including all the people in this picture.
Law enforcement is currently a closed system.
The threat is serious, and the time to prepare for it is now.
They call for a shift to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement.
I don't want to disappoint my family or friends."
Our leaders and ourselves want everything, but we don't talk about the costs.
And when we would gather as fellows, she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions.
And at the end of the war, there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living.
I also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership.
I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male.
At Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital -- money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity, but as full-bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions.
Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side-by-side -- one based on violence and the other on transcendence.
But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person's action.
We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds.
And she'd say, "I'm not talking."
But especially when I was talking to the African women, I sometimes made these mistakes -- it was so hard for me to learn how to listen."
So may each of you live lives of immersion.
Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?
And here they are.
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike.
Well, we need a reference.
And it's this machine.
Infants don't respond to much.
And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills.
That's all another way of saying that our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments.
Or you might look in an older individual who has mastered a complex set of abilities that might relate to reading musical notation or performing the mechanical acts of performance that apply to musical performance.
I don't have to be paying attention to what I hear.
This lifelong capacity for plasticity, for brain change, is powerfully expressed.
Each attempt was substantially different from the other.
We see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain.
Now actually we've looked in several different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task.
And the level of construction that occurs is massive.
And that underlies your specialization.
And it's created in the brain via physical change.
Well, it was understood by a Dutch surgeon, about 35 years ago, that if you simply fix the problem early enough, when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately, in this initial set up time in the critical period, none of that happens.
It creates a representation of language crap.
They are about an order of magnitude longer, about 11 times longer in duration on average, than in a normal child.
A way to think about this is you can actually re-refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it.
This is like an IQ test for language.
And children operating in various language behaviors, or in various reading behaviors, you see for the most extent, for most children, their neuronal responses, complexly abnormal before you start, are normalized by the training.
And what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory, of their ability to remember things after a delay, of their ability to control their attention, their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities.
But also in your future is brain aerobics.
Then I was shocked. What is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget?
Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton -- oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds, dollars.
Because I tried to make it intimate.
They also refused. Finally, I decide, use sanitary pad myself.
Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research, I come through all sorts of problems, including a divorce notice from my wife.
Why are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy?
Arunachalam Muruganantham: The thing I saw in my wife's hand, "Why are you using that nasty cloth?"
Already 600 installations. What is my mission?
And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father.
He also told me about the great explorers.
I have seen polar bears walking across very, very thin ice in search of food.
I mean, just to put it in perspective, 27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool.
It couldn't be further from the truth for me.
So myself and the five members of the team, we hitched a ride on an icebreaker which was going to the North Pole.
I remember just trying to get out of the water.
I was going to try and do a 20-minute swim, for one kilometer across the North Pole.
I so believe in you Lewis. I've seen the way you've been training.
And then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor, which measures my core body temperature and my heart rate.
We've just seen our first polar bears.
Take the goggles off. Take the goggles off!
But was it worth it? Yes, absolutely it was.
The second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time.

But this is it, this is the oil in the world.
And what goes on in the future?
Here's a piece of limestone.
What's different is how the molecules are put together.
This is pretty incredible stuff.
The oil will never run out.
I'm going to talk about a program I started there, which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.
Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.
All of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited.
And I said, "I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that."
It's energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives.
I didn't know who she was, and she said, "Did you get George Abbott to talk?"
This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months, and every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, "Oh, I just happened to be there.
I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say, to break out of their own cocoon of the public self, and the more public they had been, the more entrenched that person, that outer person was.
She was sort of adored on the Right the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left.
Anything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss, and I was basically up there -- any of you in the moderate-to-full entertainment world know what it is to die onstage.
They upstaged me." And she said, "Do you know what that is?"
And we were sitting there, and almost toward the beginning of the interview, I turned to him and I said, "Steve," or "Mr. Martin, it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods.
One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers.
He said, "You know, I've read everything, and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit."
She basically created the dances in "Oklahoma," transforming the American theater.
And she was sitting there surrounded by books, and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will, which she had by her side.
I said, "Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?"
The key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions, so that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are, and I commend that to you, even if you're not doing interviews.
It's the knock-out.
We made dozens of prototypes to get to this.
So it turns out that design for inspiration doesn't really -- I guess what I would say is, for us, for what I want to do, it's either too slow or it just doesn't work, it's ineffective.
This is a Bangladeshi hospital director outside his facility.
Our other partner is East Meets West.
There is another cure.
So these dark blue squares show you where it's effective phototherapy.
From a phototherapy standpoint, maybe not the best behavior.
They're inexpensive, really rugged.
So the idea here is we say, you want to make it hard to use wrong.
So with Firefly, what we did is -- the problem is electronics get hot and you have to put in vents or fans to keep them cool -- in most products.
I have to accept that there are no dumb users, that there's only dumb products.
One is the large global economy, the large globalized economy, and the other one is the small, and very limited, capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern, to shape, this economy.
This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank, so I want you to stop your doings."
Now, these suppliers were our big companies.
The reason was that the members of the World Bank thought that foreign bribery was okay, including Germany.
Many of them didn't want to bribe.
We had a longer-term time perspective.
In Germany, we are pushing the ratification of the UN convention, which is a subsequent convention.
Most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on.
But what I'm saying from my very practical experience: If civil society does it right and joins the other actors -- in particular, governments, governments and their international institutions, but also large international actors, in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility -- then in this magical triangle between civil society, government and private sector, there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world.
Now, sometimes you might last longer than 20 minutes, or even shorter, but I think we all suffer from it. And do you have the accompanying guilt?
Of course not, you can be selective. It's expected.
We tell stories all the time about everything, and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy, chaotic place, and sometimes stories, we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit, trying to bring some order to it.
I can't tell if she's happy or sad, and I change my mind all the time.
Well, who else would be in the house?
Not the wife, not the kids. Okay, the maid can come in and clean."
So clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women.
The next painting I'm going to talk about is called "Boy Building a House of Cards" by Chardin.
He's never going to look at me.
The last painting I'm going to talk about is called "Anonymous" by anonymous.
This must be a guy who blushes all the time.
Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune?
Afterwards, I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden.
George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.
Then came Bollywood.
And so maybe you're thinking now, why, how, an Italian filmmaker based in Boston is so interested in this story?
And so we were always caught in this stereotype.
And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa, a wonderful, talented film director who is with us tonight.
So I guess it's a world premier.
Bond Emeruwa: So while we're entertaining, we should be able to educate.
We can do something, something that when the world sees it, they say, wow, this is Nigeria.
It is not what you hear, you know, from the Western press.
OK, it's time to kick some ass.
KBI: I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won't affect my face -- the explosion, you know.
I just can't tell you -- there's one thing I want to tell you.
Incredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars.
So I really think it's a lesson that we're actually learning from them.
I think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers, and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this.
2,000 films a year?
They are bought in video shops.
So on the streets, are film casts ... ?
That's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design, and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture, is still posters, is still fast cars, what you see at MoMA today.
But also, more recently, we started acquiring video games, and that's where all hell broke loose in a really interesting way.
Did I ever say they were art? I was talking about interaction design. Excuse me.
Thank you very much. And that's more than enough.
And you know what?
That's what makes this acquisition more than a little game or a little joke. It's truly a way to think of how to preserve and show artifacts that will more and more become part of our lives in the future.
So when I show The Sims, I try to make people really feel what it meant to have an interaction with The Sims, not only the fun but also the responsibility that came with the Tamagotchi.
Eve Online is an artificial universe, if you wish, but one of the diplomats that was killed in Benghazi, not Ambassador Stevens, but one of his collaborators, was a really big shot in Eve Online, so here you have a diplomat in the real world that spends his time in Eve Online to kind of test, maybe, all of his ideas about diplomacy and about universe-building, and to the point that the first announcement of the bombing was actually given on Eve Online, and after his death, several parts of the universe were named after him.
And I was told, "No. No guns in the design collection."
But we don't have GTA because, maybe it's my own reflection, I've never been able to do anything but crashing cars and shooting prostitutes and pimps.
What we want, what we aspire to, is the code.
So the kind of interferences that you see here that look like beautiful barriers in the game are actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness, which is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important.
In this case, I'm showing you Marble Madness, which is a beautiful game in which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you, so you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape, and the sphere, the controller itself, gives you a sense of the movement.
So in a way, we're showing a manifestation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have.
I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems, or I really do solve their problems, because usually they seem to like it.
When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird, and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they're photographed or seen in that space.
And it was my theory, or my point of view, that one didn't upstage the neighborhood -- one made accommodations.
And I put a piece of tape around it, as you see there, and realized you could sit on it, and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on.
And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff.
It was pretty hard.
The way we sent drawings to Japan: we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models, and we used to make foam models, which that thing scanned.
We've been friends for a long time.
And I can tell you -- it's totally an Oldenburg.
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School.
And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle.
The whole thing about my house, the whole use of rough carpentry and everything, was the frustration with the crafts available.
The metal continued into a building -- Herman Miller, in Sacramento.
This is the central area.
I told him, "No, no, that's too ongepotchket.
And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica -- a little shopping center.
It's in the West Valley.
This is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota.
And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side.
There's a railroad track.
And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum, and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry.
I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end -- here you see on the photographs of the site -- slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom, which I designed like a kind of a barge, looking like a boat.
And then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room, and one on the other side.
Eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up -- and it will be very private.
I'm doing a building in Switzerland, Basel, which is an office building for a furniture company.
In a very tight, small -- this is the ground level.
You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built.
I don't know what to do.
I just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out.
It looks like it's kind of been there, and then crashed all these simpler forms into it.
But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit.
And we studied many models.
And the corners would have skylights and these columns would be structural.
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi.
And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel, non-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks.
And this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing.
It's where our senses are located, our special senses -- our vision, our speech, our hearing, our smell, our taste.
But let's not forget the hair.
He doesn't have dysmorphophobia, but I'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic.
We crave the approval of our peers.
But people used to say to her, "Why are you so miserable?"
Well that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them on honesty, intelligence, friendliness, violence.
Henry taught me that you can carry on working.
It was my longest operation.
We can categorize it like that.
She was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality.
After she had surgery to remove the tumor, her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress, a pink ribbon in her hair, and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world, despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims and the mother wore a full burqa.
If you spend five minutes with somebody, you start looking beyond their facial appearance, and the people who you're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them, and the people who you didn't immediately seek out, because you didn't find them particularly attractive, become attractive people because of their personality.
And he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chin and his upper jaw and teeth.
That's the good news.
They have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.
This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe.
Let's leave it as it is."
When I took over this, I tried to really figure out, like, what my vision would be.
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness.
And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed, but it's an issue in the food supply.
That's what I really try and get people to understand.
We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick.
What's going to happen?
You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more, and more, and more.
This is the stuff we were feeding our kids: Extremo Burritos, corn dogs, pizza pockets, grilled cheese sandwiches.
And we, all of us, have to understand that this is about us, that we can make a difference here.
You know, that vegetables are actually colorful, that they have flavor, that carrots grow in the ground, that strawberries grow in the ground.
This is what we're serving this week at the schools.
We have to start changing this.
We have to teach kids that Coke and Pop Tarts aren't breakfast.
Most schools in America spend less than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child.
And one of the simple things we can do is put recess before lunch.
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could.
Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA, I think it should be under CDC.
200 billion.
Thank you.
In my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life, I started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that."
What really excites me about these storms is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate, with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.
But then, on the other hand, you have the American cities.
And the urban planner in London goes, "What do you mean, who's in charge of London's — I mean, no one is in charge."
And let's now look at how we can use this insight to combat road congestion.
Now, that's also wrong, because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon, meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really, really rapidly.
But you see, there's an interesting gap here in the time series in 2007.
And it turned out that they don't know themselves.
Which means that we are now in a position where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon with 20 percent, and reduced congestion by enormous numbers, and people aren't even aware that they have changed, and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along.
I heard their prayer and ate their bread.
So I have been walking and traveling, by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking, from Iran's border to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor.
Clothed in this nylon bag, made in China, with the name of burqa.
I'm going to define what the terms of my success are."
One of the senior doctors at my hospital, Charlie Safran, and his colleague, Warner Slack, have been saying for decades that the most underutilized resource in all of health care is the patient.
Here, just for historical authenticity, is a picture of me in that year.
The phone rang and it was my doctor.
So at that point we knew that it was cancer.
This is much sharper than an ultrasound would be.
Before I met her, I went through some suboptimal search results.
And what I found was on other websites, even by the third page of Google results, "Outlook is bleak", "Prognosis is grim."
I fainted and landed on it, and it broke.
It's really serious.
Here's the thing.
And when she came down those steps, and it was just her and me for that moment, I was so glad that she didn't have to say to her mother, "I wish Dad could have been here."
She came to realize that there were a lot of people who'd written patient advocate books that you just don't hear about at medical conferences.
Think about the possibility, why is it that iPhones and iPads advance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take care of your family?
But you see, it's still generic.
So she took it.
What she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data.
For all the patients around the world watching this on the webcast, God bless you, everyone -- let patients help.
Removing the salts from water -- particularly seawater -- through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe.
If we remove this mammal from our ecosystems, they simply will not work.
Bats as we know them have been around on this planet for about 64 million years.
We're a visual species. When scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night, we didn't believe it.
If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia, you've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and if you just look at their face, you can see they have much, much larger eyes and much smaller ears.
This is considered the Five Blessings.
It's been estimated in the U.S., in a tiny colony of big brown bats, that they will feed on over a million insects a year, and in the United States of America, right now bats are being threatened by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.
And what about the second? What about health?
So through natural selection, over time, mutations, variations that disrupt the function of a protein will not be tolerated over time.
But we are going to have to understand it a bit better.
But what would be so amazing about this?
Potentially, this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it.
What I'm going to offer you is a recipe, a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good, which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest.
The last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s.
But what else did you do?
Yes, you tear up the "Eleventh Commandment" -- national sovereignty.
The opportunity we're going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion, and that is the commodity booms.
And how about the long run?
The resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance.
Now, there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s, and that is the spread of democracy.
They got instant democracy in the 1990s: elections without checks and balances.
So, we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards?
They worked out they were worth two billion pounds.
If you think about it, the cost of promulgating international rules is zilch -- nothing.
If you agree with that sentiment, and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry, you will realize that I need you.
And you can see how focused the surgeons are, how much concentration it takes.
We build on that and we take people, hopefully, to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant.
Now just this past year, one of our partners, the American College of Surgeons, teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons should be FLS -certified before they do minimally invasive surgery.
So I was inspired by a friend.
It's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility.
One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world.
And it has to be bi-directional.
So let me show you what we're doing.
Allan Okrainec: Today we're going to practice suturing.
We have a need to learn as well as to teach.
I was an unlikely person to be doing this.
I went for a walk on the beach, watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.
Thousands of people saw it, and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto, Portugal.
He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement.
As I watched the wind's choreography unfold, I felt sheltered and, at the same time, connected to limitless sky.
It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates, sped up the planet's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day.
Thank you. Thank you.
And so then I went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil.
And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society.
Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program, control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.
We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.
They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.
We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into, using this technology, the human mind and brain.
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim, which, of course, may or may not be true.
So, in talking about values we are talking about facts.
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access, that few people access.
The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.
As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.
There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food.
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.
If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around, in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.
When you're talking about the veil, you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.
Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward, 100 years forward, how you would like to think of the world, balancing moral progress with richness.
So, you can say like, "Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend, I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do."
And then I thought, myself, how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology?
In general, I'm going to talk about insects and spiders, or mites, let us call them.
And here you can see this lady in action on your left-hand side -- just pierces, sucks the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite.
Parthenogenesis, [as it] was so called.
She stands vis-a-vis in front of the victim at the right-hand side, bending its abdomen and inserting a single egg, a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid.
This is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside, in fact, a developing parasitoid that after a few minutes you see halfway out.
But this is a nice, slender, very bad pest.
So this is a very positive situation, by the way.
And by the way, mass-production -- it is not genetic manipulation.
So the impact is very strong.
It hardly happens.
I think it's times 100 or something like that.
So I think my last slide is: All we are saying, we can actually sing it: Give nature a chance.
This was one of a series called "Zany Afternoons," which became a book.
Automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties.
So the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go.
It's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened.
The copy, which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages, says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over, and it's so safe it carries no insurance.
I've done about 40 of them, and I'd say 30 of them are based on that concept.
This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France.
Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover, in the middle of the night, this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down.
What would be a good end of life?
They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge for the bears and lions and so many other things that lived there.
The beginning of the end is triggered by a mortality awareness event, and during this time, Jim and Shirley chose ACR nature preserves to take their ranch over when they were gone.
I've put worksheets online, so if you'd like, you can plan your own end.
Tape a set to your refrigerator.
So, this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial.
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies? The problem is obviously relevant to our situation today, because today as well, there are some societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also societies today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia.
In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland, the climate got colder in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate isn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting Greenland at the same time -- did better, rather than worse, with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well?
Problems from weeds, weed control, cost Montana nearly 200 million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas from salinization, problems of forest management, problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist: climate change. Yes -- the climate in Montana is getting warmer and drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack, and as the snow is melting -- for example, as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing -- that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture.
In a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation, and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty, and then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.
It seems incredible in the past. In the future, it'll seem incredible what we are doing today. And so I've been trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations about why societies fail to solve their problems -- why they fail to perceive the problems or, if they perceive them, why they fail to tackle them. Or, if they tackle them, why do they fail to succeed in solving them?
Well, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses of a few decades to -- all of them, not more than 50 years, and any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water, of soil, of climate change, invasive species, the photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. -- listing about 12 of them. And while these time bombs -- none of them has a fuse beyond 50 years, and most of them have fuses of a few decades -- some of them, in some places, have much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now, the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest within five years. And the Solomon Islands are only one year away from losing their loggable forest, which is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me, Jared, what's the most important thing that we need to do about the world's environmental problems?
There's six million species of insects on this planet, six million species.
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars.
Even larger animals eat insects.
That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating, like a cow or a pig or a sheep.
And that's your view of a tomato.
It's being produced in large amounts, 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru, and it's big business.
And if you look at the figures up there, it says that we have a third more mouths to feed, but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent.
So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average, and a third of the world population is living in China and in India, we're having an enormous demand on meat.
So far we're taking the one, or up to five kilograms of output.
So that's three points for insects.
We'll have to.
It's just very good food.
We're not used to it, and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.
And maybe by 2020, you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.
You should try it yourself.
MD: Thank you.
And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free.
I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa.
"After you." "Oh, no, no. After you."
No reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no.
My next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally, right after a shift at the gift shop.
Even when a Canadian cheats the system, they do it in a way that benefits society.
Well, the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe.
Yes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391, to his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.
This is the mater, the scales on the back.
But a real one would cost about as much as my house, and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block, on both sides of the street, maybe a school thrown in, and some -- you know, a church.
So, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there.
as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.
So, that's just one use. Incredible, there is probably 350, 400 uses.
There is portable ones. There is large display ones.
Probably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood, or paper. And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket.
And so, what can you learn from these devices?
What you're doing is, when you stand up, potential energy to kinetic energy, potential energy to kinetic energy.
The one in front, the smaller, is STriDER II.
We are literally re-inventing the wheel here.
The front wheels rotate like this.
So, inspired by that we wanted to build a robot that can climb a structured cliff environment.
We actually have a very interesting payload on there.
So, this is some of the early feasibility experiments.
We wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction.
This was in 2004; at that time, this was something really, really revolutionary.
So, in 2006, now it's really time to have fun.
It's a true actual goal. It's a very ambitious goal, but we truly believe that we can do it.
Thank you.
So, what is the secret of our success?
Where do we get this spark of imagination?
So, I need to decipher what I wrote.
Nobody criticizes any opinion.
This picture in the back this is 3 a.m. in the morning.
It's about two hours east driving-time from Raleigh.
The brain drain -- where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back.
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant.
And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class, and you can see the difference is pretty stark.
And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary, and he is the reason that I now live and work there.
We now call this place home.
The initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger -- that was why we were there.
And then she'll call out a math problem -- so let's say four times four -- and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is 16 and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it.
So in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change, which is easier said than done in rural communities and in inside-the-box education systems in rural communities.
So "design as education" means that we could actually teach design within public schools, and not design-based learning -- not like "let's learn physics by building a rocket," but actually learning design-thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose.
So we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one-year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class.
This is Ryan.
He's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure, so if he ends up not going to college, he will have developed some industry-relevant skills.
Because, when you zoom out that far, you lose the ability to view people as humans.
But fossil fuels, carbon -- coal and gas -- are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change.
Now you're told over and over, repeatedly, that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi-arid areas of the world, and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence.
And I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery.
It made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions.
Now, by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world's land, you are changing macroclimate.
Now, all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season, and if it doesn't, the grassland and the soil begin to die.
What are we going to do?
We'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals, but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.
But as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it, has evaporated from the soil surface.
Ninety-five percent of that land can only feed people from animals.
Thank you, Chris.
That is an astonishing talk, truly an astonishing talk, and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way.
It'll sound corny, but it's sincere.
That's the humanitarian mission.
That's a case of microphthalmos, which is malformed eyes, and that's a permanent condition; it cannot be treated.
In our eyes, the lens is clear, but in this child, the lens has become opaque, and therefore he can't see the world.
So, hers is just a truly inspiring story -- unknown, but inspiring story.
If you show him real world images, if you show others like him real world images, they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over-fragmented; it's made up of a collage, a patchwork, of regions of different colors and luminances.
This one is a circle, and this is a square.
Now, how many things are these?
And that's what we're trying to do.
In fact, Pam, if you're watching this, please forgive me.
So, it's an important demonstration of the power of motion.
Contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game.
Thank you very much.
I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet to see how far I could run, and about 50 meters was enough for me, panting and heaving.
And I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world.
And we got to talking, and it turned out to be a great partnership because he'd never coached a disabled athlete, so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what I was or wasn't capable of, and I'd never been coached before.
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level.
Like, I almost came out of it, in front of, like, 5,000 people.
He kept me on the right track.
I was also the only, what they call "bilateral BK" -- below the knee.
These legs that I was on, which I'll take out right now -- I was the first person in the world on these legs.
And, you know, I'm just thinking, "Oh, my god, my whole family got in a van and drove down here from Pennsylvania."
All this training -- I had transformed my life.
SS: Why don't you show them your legs?
AM: I got to pick my height, exactly.
It has a shock absorber in it so it, like, "Shhhh," makes this neat sound when you jump around on it. All right.
And so, I run on these, and have shocked half the world on these.
SS: Yes, there you go.
It is. It's just stuck in this position, so I have to wear a two-inch heel.
They didn't even want to touch that one. They just did it.
For instance, just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft.
But total movie revenues across theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up.
Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people.
Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket.
Those learning it think it's disconnected, uninteresting and hard.
See, in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.
What's the point of teaching people math?
And also verify it -- crucial step.
We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that I could ever imagine with computers.
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor.
And then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating, but I think they're relatively small in number.
Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first.
So automation allows this separation and also allows -- in the case of driving, and I believe also in the future case of maths -- a democratized way of doing that.
If you were born after computers and paper, it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in, you just want to have the best tool.
Now, of course, like any great tool, they can be used completely mindlessly, like turning everything into a multimedia show, like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand, where the computer was the teacher -- show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand.
It's called programming.
What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before.
This was an example I built for my daughter.
In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams, it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters.
This isn't some optional extra.
Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math, but what I am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future.
As I did, so slid the chair.
But that little story is really about the fears and misconceptions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without sight, seemingly oblivious to the environment and the people around you.
From that came a lot of insights, or outsights, as I called them, things that I learned since losing my sight.
I was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are, how you need to move, and where you need to go.
And I'm not paranoid, but everywhere I go, I'm getting all sorts of advice: Go here, move there, watch out for this.
But believe me, there are more polite ways to offer assistance.
I didn't get that sighted.
It's a different way of thinking about it, but I think it's kind of beautiful, because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us-versus-them or the abled-versus-the-disabled, and it's a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life.
If you design a city with the blind in mind, you design a city with a robust, accessible, well-connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around.
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.
You can just Google it.
So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of -- The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.
You only know if you try it.
But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress, because I couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts.
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.
But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.
So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons that I learned from my year.
And this one was a big lesson because I was praying, giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.
This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath, because I am a workaholic, so having this one day where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.
But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance, evangelical Christianity, and I found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it.
This one was very unexpected because, you know, I grew up with the scientific worldview, and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces.
And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible.
So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion, about tolerance, about loving your neighbor, as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin, or intolerance, or violence, which are very much in the Bible as well.
Now, this is an interesting little message, and it's a lesson that has since, I think, been forgotten or lost or something, and that is, namely, that the OS is the interface.
Networks, we didn't have networks at all at the time of the Macintosh's introduction, and that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers.
That's a digital storage in a physical container.
Similarly, a digital wind tunnel with digital wind flowing from right to left -- not that remarkable in a sense; we didn't invent the mathematics.
Short shadows at noon and so forth.
But it was that work that was seen by Alex McDowell, one of the world's legendary production designers.
And that's all well and good.
We can organize it this way.
And we'll perform this Boolean operation because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass.
These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States.
And finally, I'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery.
Yeah, let's take that one.
So I will leave you with that. Thank you.
You know, how can it work?
JU: That's a good question, and we ask ourselves that every day.
And there was a lawyer in Nairobi, Ory Okolloh -- who some of you may know from her TEDTalk -- who began blogging about it on her site, Kenyan Pundit.
Ushahidi -- the name means "witness" or "testimony" in Swahili -- is a very simple way of taking reports from the field, whether it's from the web or, critically, via mobile phones and SMS, aggregating it and putting it on a map.
What Okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity.
And they are also part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now.
Now it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis without the LOLcats, right, to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff.
And so they went and studied 10 daycare centers in Haifa, Israel.
Boom. No ifs, ands or buts."
They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones.
Both of these design for the assumption that people like to create and we want to share.
It really is going to be a side effect of what we, collectively, make of these kinds of efforts.
But we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value.
But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket: because we had about the same pace of life.
As you can see, you can play anywhere.
1991,'92, we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India, rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country.
The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars."
We got to the final, and then this moment, that will remain enshrined forever, for everybody, take a look.
If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go, but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game.
One was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often.
An opening ceremony to match every other.
So, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago, overnight. And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies, they asked him, "When do you have to reach?"
But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket, which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.
And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd.
So thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan.
HB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day -- so 250 rupees for a test match, but if you finish in four days you only got 200.
Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today.
Cricketers all over the world said, "You know, we love India. We love to play in India."
Thank you very much. Thank you.
The way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs.
The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind isn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"
Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is, we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery, or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.
The expected value of this lottery is two dollars; this is a lottery in which you should invest your money.
I want to talk now about errors in value.
And this is a systematic error people make.
Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500 for something that was 700 last week.
What the hell difference should it make?
Now, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course, and they use this wisdom to help you -- spare you the undue burden of money.
I have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars, but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.
It doesn't know what you saved it on.
Now, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo.
This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?
Maybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen.
As Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.
Well, the question with which I'd like to end is this: If we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?
Thank you.
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways, and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.
DG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them.
DG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people -- we would probably not be nearly so frightened.
That's a tough one.
DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves.
But certainly I see your point: that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.
Well, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.
'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity, because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind.
He apparently lost an eye in battle, which is why he is always shown in profile.
I said, "Well, it's so persuasive, because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage, and since most people are so suspicious of garages, and know that they're going to be ripped off, they use the word 'reliable.' But everybody says they're reliable.
And this was the text -- "In words as fashion the same rule will hold/ Alike fantastic if too new or old/ Be not the first by whom the new are tried/ Nor yet the last to lay the old aside."
There's a relationship between the old and the new; the new emerges from the context of the old.
But, to my credit, I was so embarrassed about doing that that I never submitted this sketch.
Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace, a kind of dance where each defines the other."
I mean -- you've got to be confident; if you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it?
And here, a very peculiar poster because, simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer, it won't sit still in the space.
But then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever."
And the one that I did not submit, which I still like, I wanted to use the same phrase.
It sort of ended abruptly when she was executed — — for murdering 600 men. You see, it wasn't a very good perfume.
So by and large, they are good for our survival.
In fact, just having a diseased appearance or odd sexual acts, these things are also things that give us a lot of disgust.
A more modern example comes from people who try to convince us that homosexuality is immoral.
"Do you agree or disagree?"
When we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation, but voting behavior, we were able to look geographically across the nation. What we found was that in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity, McCain got more votes.
Let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted. We asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups, and we either made the room smell gross or not.
When his grandmother's away, he has sex with his girlfriend on his grandma's bed.
This is very strange for me, because I'm not used to doing this: I usually stand on the other side of the light, and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...
And I will start with a brief taster of what I've been about: a handful of films -- nothing much, two feature films and a handful of short films.
Nigeria.
Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.
Marcus: Whose reality?
Boy: See man, you're just taking the piss out of me now.
Director 2: Can you not shut up?
Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood to go and film something real?
So, for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.
There's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means.
CS: The barrel of the gun!
Various Voices: You will die! You will die!
Mariam is pregnant.
This must be the mine.
State your name and age for the commission.
E: So you too must stand trial then.
No.
And considering where you are coming from, and when we consider the extent to which it's not taken as seriously as it should be, what would you have to say about that?
That was a very moving piece.
MM: It starts playing immediately.
And as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out.
Do you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser?
When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water.
I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect, to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.
It's a big issue.
Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife.
So where do we go now?
So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me.
RSW: Why did you want that?
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building.
Audience: Liquid architecture.
FG: I don't know.
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.
You've got to work with the building department.
RSW: Didn't get a laugh.
They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget, be polite, and they're missing out on the real value of an architect.
Usually I say no right away, but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings.
We sat down, and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet.
And we get a lot of that.
I'm going to make it for you!
The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.
Now when you see these mountains, most people think of garbage.
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material?
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say, particularly from the United States, where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling.
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India.
And we eventually broke the code.
It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil, and it's plentiful, as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.
In the short time period I have, I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.
So now, instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke, you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products, in your office, or back at work in your home.
And I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring, along a roadside.
And that got me to go out and look at mines like this, and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that I could find.
So I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man: the Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age.
And how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion?
These things are continuing to happen.
Here you're looking at some oil fields in California, some of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that -- there was another epiphany -- that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil.
It took fifteen days to fill it.
And it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.
You're seeing the tuxedos, the bouquets.
This is one of the biggest shoe factories, the Yuyuan shoe factory near Shenzhen. It has 90,000 employees making shoes.
And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them.
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced.
And when you start looking at that, and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai, it's literally a forest of skyscrapers.
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.
That condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want, which is, you know, 400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.
So you have about 12 people running this, and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines.
They make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers -- they make 20 million of them in the world.
It's referred to as "e-waste" there.
One's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.
And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blog is now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month.
And what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text, and the text is blasted all over.
And one of the things that came out -- Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.
The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable.
And wish three is: Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself, and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.
The errors we make are actually predictable.
Because we're a smart species, we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super, super complicated, sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand, even though we've actually created them.
It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways.
You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant, but albeit evolutionary, relative.
First problem is just, well, where should we start?
So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money.
They were these kind of weird things.
But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.
So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.
They really cared about their monkey token dollar.
So we said, this looks bad.
Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.
Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?
You can either take a risky loss -- so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.
That means when we're in a risk mindset -- excuse me, when we're in a loss mindset, we actually become more risky, which can actually be really worrying.
People here played it safe.
They guy on the left is a safe loss.
Well, what we've shown is that, first of all, we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency, and they do very similar things with it.
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.
You know, think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.
Well, the good news, I think, is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk, which is that humans are not only smart; we're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.
The hope is that you all will think about your limitations, not necessarily as unovercomable, but to recognize them, accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out.
But wood is the material that I love the most, and I'm going to tell you the story about wood.
The scale of the challenge for architects and for society to deal with in building is to find a solution to house these people.
And although a lot of that is about energy, it's also so much about carbon.
So I believe that we have an ethic that the Earth grows our food, and we need to move to an ethic in this century that the Earth should grow our homes.
Mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks.
But to build a fire, you kind of start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up, and eventually you can add the log to the fire, and when you do add the log to the fire, of course, it burns, but it burns slowly.
We've calculated a 20-story building: We'll grow enough wood in North America every 13 minutes.
And the way I describe it is this.
There's a building in London that's nine stories, a new building that just finished in Australia that I believe is 10 or 11.
They would offer sweets or money.
Christmas morning, where we open up our gifts, where we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment.
That's what the celebration is all about.
I see pictures, and something says, "Now, that's compassion."
You heard about riots all across the land.
I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while, and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world, and we can do that together."
'Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated, when we have been despised and rejected.' And they all spoke out of their own traditions, a word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other."
But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly, you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable.
This is a season of grace.
The song says, "I made heaven so happy today, Receiving God's love and giving it away When I looked up, heaven smiled at me Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? Let me share my happy loving smile with you. That's compassion.
Social media were blocked at the firewall.
Governments exist to channel the flow of two things, really, values and expertise to and from government and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions.
We live in a Cambrian era of big data, of social networks, and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions that are actually quite recent.
They cannot replace government.
Some of it's very high-tech, and some of it is extremely low-tech, such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan, India, where they take the spending data of the state and paint it on 100,000 village walls, and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll, who's actually died, what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere, and to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have access to that budget.
February 2012 to June of 2012, the finalists are announced in the competition.
It doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data to change lives, to solve problems, and it doesn't change government.
The second phase is in getting decision-making power out.
So let me close by saying that I think the important thing for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution.
And we're doing this through some case studies.
And what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing, it's not an image, it's not an artifact, actually it's a space, and it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side.
And so you can see dinosaurs and insects and collections of locomotives and all of that, but you're really not involved; you're being talked to.
But beyond exhibiting contemporary art, the Hirshhorn will become a public forum, a place of discourse for issues around arts, culture, politics and policy.
Very, very difficult to mount shows in there.
It has to be ephemeral. It has to be formless.
The membrane is translucent.
There was also some creative interpretation involved.
And so we couldn't really touch its surfaces.
It's taken off the delivery truck.
But some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones.
Form and content are together here.
And also telling it like now.
But one thing I knew was an image that I saw that stuck in my head.
So that pain has gone out.
Voices in my brain, of friends that was slain.
Left home at the age of seven.
I carry the banner of the trauma.
Left home.
I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed?
You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it.
I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month, but I've been humbled.
I'm willing to die for this, because I know what it can do to my people.
Invest in education.
That's what I want to do to change, to make a difference in the world.
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma?
And during a pause in my conversation with Katya, I looked over at Lincoln and I was suddenly thunderstruck by a recollection of a client of mine.
But I don't want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment. I certainly think that my client shouldn't have been executed, but what I would like to do today instead is talk about the death penalty in a way I've never done before, in a way that is entirely noncontroversial.
But that fourth chapter always ends with an execution.
Do you know what all-time low in Texas means?
All that I want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death penalty lawyers have understood that the earlier you intervene in a case, the greater the likelihood that you're going to save your client's life.
How do we do that?
You know, sometimes people say that something isn't rocket science.
But the fact that we still have a lot to learn, that doesn't mean that we don't know a lot already.
There are a handful of states that do that; Texas doesn't.
They had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison, they had to establish strict separation between the people who work at the school and the prison authorities, and most dauntingly of all, they needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what?
I want to tell you about the last conversation that I had with Will.
And I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents?" And my dad said, "Well, yes.
How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me?
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss.
The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six.
But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready."
But I got the new Libra poster, and I started to read my new Libra horoscope, and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.
Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was, sort of, curious, so I said, "Well, please, come in." And they looked really happy, because I don't think this happens to them all that often.
And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi, who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.
Well, then they said, "Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets?" And I said, "No, I don't."
They said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon and if you're in good standing with the church, when you die you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity."
OK, so, I initially felt really superior to these boys, and smug in my more conventional faith. But then, the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself.
He said, "I have a dream."
And we have not thought enough about the solutions.
This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear -- that more is better.
But as early as 1968, this visionary man, Robert Kennedy, at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign, gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been.
It's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness, and it's not nearly as important as love.
And probably the easiest way to show you that, is to show you this graph.
They are the U.S.A., other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually.
The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven't been to.
We can look at some of the data.
And the challenge, really, is to pull the global average up here.
It's actually not very long away.
None of us, I think, want human progress to stop.
Human beings are very motivated by the "now."
Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do, and energy?
Older people who keep learning and are curious, they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.
You measure their happiness at the end of the day, those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves.
Human beings want to be happy.
Half were given random Bible topics.
There are these newly identified neurons, mirror neurons, that act like a neuro Wi-Fi, activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel "with" automatically.
You can see it at a gross level in the world of dating.
There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist.
Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities of a compassionate consumerism.
There's a company, Bennett and Company, that supplies Polo.com, Victoria's Secret -- they, because of their CEO, who's aware of this, in China formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater.
And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless. And I realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go. They had a diagnosis. It made me -- what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where, when we see, when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision, it stays on the periphery.
Thank you very much.
But the question is, why is it obvious?
First, we move along linear routes.
Now, I don't know about you, but I always feel like I find this wormhole or this inter-dimensional portal.
So next time, when you want to tell your friend how to get to your place, you grab a beermat, grab a napkin, and you just observe yourself create this awesome piece of communication design. It's got straight lines.
Typically, you choose yourself a rapid transport route, and in your mind this route is perceived as a straight line, and like a pearl necklace, all the stations and stops are nicely and neatly aligned along the line, and only then you start to discover some local bus routes that would fill in the gaps and that allow you for those wormhole, inter-dimensional portal shortcuts.
I'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of the quays and Westmoreland Street.
They would get exclusive road use, where possible, and it would be high-quantity, high-quality transport.
Each individual route is represented by a separate line.
I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee.
As a dancer, I know the nine rasas or the navarasas: anger, valor, disgust, humor and fear.
I needed something that would pull me out of all this.
How do you not despair when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy, climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture, that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance.
She was also called Simhanandini, the one who rode the lion.
And so he gave me the time to code it up.
It was just very frustrating.
Not impressive.
I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents -- I said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?"
Well, documents you read, OK?
In this case, Hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.
So that's it, really.
And in most information boxes, there's data.
We could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important, there's scientific data, there's personal data, there's weather data, there's data about events, there's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.
So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better by making this data available.
Tim Berners-Lee: Can you say "data"?
Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now -- curing cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's, understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable, understanding how the world works.
The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist -- questions which actually bridge across different disciplines -- is really a complete sea change.
But, when you go to another linked data site -- and let's say this is one about travel, and you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group," you can't get over the walls.
I've only told you a very small number of things There are data in every aspect of our lives, every aspect of work and pleasure, and it's not just about the number of places where data comes, it's about connecting it together.

Well, I definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through, and here's just a few reasons why.
But then, a lot of people think there are things that should have been in the original package that weren't agreed back then that should now be included, like sustainable development targets, natural resource governance targets, access to opportunity, to knowledge, equity, fighting corruption.
I mean, wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this, given that we can?
If we have this collected data, and this connected crowd, based upon our experience of campaigning and getting world leaders to commit, I think world leaders will commit to most of the crowdsourced recommendations.
And look at the state of global politics today.
It's getting near zero.
But these conferences are going on, and I know people get skeptical and cynical about the big global summits and the promises and their never being kept, but actually, the bits that are, are making a difference, and what the politicians need is more permission from the public.
I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn, because I had an apology to make to her.
RB: I read all these sort of TED instructions: you must not talk about your own business, and this, and now you ask me.
And in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.
RB: Yeah, as it turned out, it proved to be the right move.
RB: We couldn't find any customers.
Really? You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful.
What was that? Was that real?
Do you like to be called Sir Richard, or how?
So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?
He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago.
RB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was, each one, actually, I think we came close.
But, anyway, we managed to survive it.
RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that: just I love you very much. And I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which -- just in case anything had happened.
RB: Well, I won't contradict that.
And so, it's like, good news or bad news?
I mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids, and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up.
On the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which -- we had a center where we would help young people who had problems.
And he said, "Look, bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever.
So seriously, is there a dark side?
You get excited by an idea and, kapow!
But the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people, and therefore extreme responsibility, I think, goes with that wealth.
RB: Yes, I mean, we've got -- we're setting up something called the war room, which is maybe the wrong word.
It's got to be consistent.
And, thank God, you've got two people who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.
It's like after every exam, when I walk out, the teacher would say, "Hey, come.
"Oh, he's bad at studies, but let him send to the drawing competitions."
And he said, "Oh, I teach at a college of arts.
But it is just a kind of trace of that time.
And then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces.
So it took about 24 hours to get this line.
Why the cow was crossing the road, you know.
It's just that being a human, the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning.
And we're just pulling the wall off the gallery.
The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting, because I wrote to Balsara, who produces that air freshener called Odonil, saying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist. This is my catalogue.
And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi.
It's in the same gallery or in the same museum.
Because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together, or we can break the sculpture and get the dust, but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe."
And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too; we see the source of the light.
The skin of this is also representing this.
Detail.
I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are, how globalized we aren't, and why it's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of assessments.
I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow, one kind of flow of people, one kind of flow of capital, and, of course, trade in products and services.
It's actually about three percent.
But it's not just the apocalyptics, as I think of them, who are prone to this kind of overstatement.
Especially because, I suspect, some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney.
And as I was laughing, I was thinking, I really need a more coherent response, especially on national TV. I'd better write something about this.
And I got this question often enough that I thought I'd better do some research on Facebook.
So foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here, because if you think about it, what I've been talking about today is this notion -- very uncontroversial amongst economists -- that most things are very home-biased.
So, here you can see the change from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.
And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing.
It's the same with brands: the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has, the more force is needed to change its positioning.
By measuring it, the act of measurement changes it.
Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking, more digital media consumption, you can measure more what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they do.
Think about Toyota.
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force, which is ultimately good for your brand.
Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.
So all of this is pretty innovative, if you consider that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it; one to turn the crank, and another person -- yes -- to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.
CP: Okay.
Because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that Americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity, and we know that because there's all this language in English that seems to be talking about baseball but that's really talking about sexual activity.
This baseball model is incredibly problematic.
So when do you play baseball?
It's competitive.
And even if you've had pizza with somebody for a very long time, don't you still say things like, "Should we get the usual?"
When we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza, isn't it all about what's our pleasure?
But what about pizza?
But if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza, we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires, to make deliberate decisions about what they want, to talk about it with their partners, and to ultimately look for not some external outcome but for what feels satisfying, and we get to decide that.
But I want to start with my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work.
He said, "Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another."
The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out."
You become extremely sexually possessive.
I was just staggered by it.
The motor of the brain. It's a drive.
W.H. Auden called it an "intolerable neural itch," and indeed, that's what it is.
One of the last 10,000 years and the other, certainly of the last 25 years, that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems: lust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner.
For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work to gather their vegetables.
And it's going to have an impact.
One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk.
Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producers who call me, who negotiate what we're going to say, is a woman.
And I say, "Why do you think more men are adulterous than women?"
This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.
And I looked -- for one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.
That's why casual sex isn't so casual.
So I don't think, honestly, we're an animal that was built to be happy; we are an animal that was built to reproduce.
She's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13.
And when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm.
And about a year ago, an Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them.
And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody, you can drive up the dopamine in the brain, and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love.
They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called "this mortal coil."
In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do that was actually going to save her life.
As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself, if you just tried caring even a little bit, you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you've never met about to amputate your foot.
Three years later, I found out how wrong I was.
Now your blood sugar levels start to rise, and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease, cancer, even Alzheimer's disease, and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier.
You treat the obesity.
And because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells, it's probably the safest place to store it.
So what if we're fighting the wrong war, fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance?
When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago, I did it simply by restricting those things, which admittedly suggests I have a bias based on my personal experience.
Others think it's too much dietary fat.
Just because you know what to do doesn't mean you're always going to do it.
I'd like to tell her how sorry I am.
My life is guided by two great passions, and the first is automobiles.
My dad finished dinner early that evening.
Because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress.
Of course, I had no intention of doing that, and I kept speaking out about the environment, and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability.
And that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened, just as the environment is.
Today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams, and that's a huge waste of time and resources.
Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge, and they're really very, very inconvenient, but that's all they are.
We don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic, sitting at tollbooths or looking for parking spots.
So parking garages, buses, trains, they all operate within the same system.
So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic, it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way.
The solution is not going to be more cars, more roads or a new rail system; it can only be found, I believe, in a global network of interconnected solutions.
Because, if you can envision, as I do, a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today, that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow.
And that's what I want to talk about today.
This is 59 seconds into the film.
He just lay in the hospital bed, and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time.
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley, so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor, you could actually have a conversation with them.
So you went from public space to private space.
And he invented the shipping container.
This was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.
We don't know why, but we do.
We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.
Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh.
So, what came out of this?
Last section: green armband. We've all got them.
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.
We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.
Inspiration is contagious.
And in two hours, after their backs were broke, they were changed.
So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.
Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children, in the future the children will give back to the city.
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.
It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me that they had so much inside them.
So, how can we still stay immune?
We reached a tipping point this year where living, acting, designing, investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens, entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic, capitalistic, geo-political and competitive thing they could do.
He was a design scientist, if you like, a poet, but he foresaw all the things that are happening now.
People who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams, and the objects that he would create for the company called Braun.
Buildings are important, but they're only a component of a much bigger picture.
For example, if you take, and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city, what I'll call, simplistically, a North American city -- and Detroit is not a bad example, it is very car dependent.
And now, out of typically 46 cities, 33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.
And particularly, how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy, create less pollution and are more socially responsible?
In 2001, this building received an award.
And a combination of devices here, the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks, and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin, which enables the building to be ventilated, to consume dramatically less energy, and where it's really working with the forces of nature.
And on the left are the cutting machines, which then, in the factory, enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very, very few millimeters, to be slotted together on site.
For wind tunnels, we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air, and the many kilometers of cable and so on.
It's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.
But here, not having to model it for real.
There is an evolution here between the projects, and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further -- the project in the city in London.
And unlike conventional buildings, the top of the building is celebratory.
What if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are, of the Grand Canal, in terms of tourists, habitation, desalination, agriculture?
The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say, "We put a man on the moon."
And here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings -- the chapel Notre Dame du Haut, Ronchamp -- where he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark.
And he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky, and where you can experience the sun, that give us a better life in the built environment, just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows.
As you can see here, there's some direct light on the floor, but they could easily figure out where that comes from.
It has only on one side this big, big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range.
And you enter that space, and you feel like, "Wow! This is so impressive," just because of this focal point, this huge light source in the middle.
These three distinct elements, together, make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better.
But our circadian rhythms, which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on, they are much more triggered by blue light.
I took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou, and I realized that 10 years ago, there was nothing like this, of these buildings.
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity because this tiny, tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it.
Now, every LED that is made these days gives blue light.
We have to think again about light as a default solution.
And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult.
What just happened? What will be happening in the next five minutes?
But I also think of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals, where light and dark, in very gentle combinations, alter each other to define the space.
In other words, the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds.
I was talking about social justice, and here I was, a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act -- of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous, getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and publishing them in the papers, getting invited to the conferences, getting consultancies and whatever have you.
They must not remain anonymous.
You cannot discriminate.
You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand, because this man knows how insensitive our government is.
You must have taken tea in the morning.
This is not what our parliament would do. You know, we have a program for employment: One hundred, 250 million people have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country.
And it all begins with curiosity.
Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment, only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something.
So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.
But to be able to give them high-quality output you need to adapt technology to their needs.
But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?
So it is better, it is safer; it is affordable, it is energy-efficient.
Higher the local fit, greater is the chance of scaling up.
One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question -- "What is a scalable model?" -- as if the need of a community, which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places, has no legitimate right to get them for free because it's not part of a larger scale.
Even love needs help from technology.
A very powerful message Appachan: I watch the world wake up every day.
But this innovation emerged in Brazil.
This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus.
This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.
If you have an idea, send it back to us."
They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire, to get rid of all that mechanical stuff.
What I don't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied.
And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies, I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry -- who's been very supportive of us -- that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.
And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years, have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.
And every one of those industries, by the way -- just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.
What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean, environmentally friendly?
We've been so concerned about that, we went to the Postmaster General of the United States, as the first person we ever showed on the outside, and said, "Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.
A few weeks ago, after we launched it, we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back, and he's marveling at the technology, and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by, and skateboarders are zipping by, and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary, a little old lady -- came by me -- and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now -- and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me and says, "Can I try that?"
I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things."
They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.
If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes, you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car, re-park your car and go somewhere; you can't get to a cab or a subway.
But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say, you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.
The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions and burning trucks used as barricades across the city, so truly like a battlefield.
If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico by, say, just researching online, the first thing you would find out is that while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal, there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others, because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people have lost their lives in drug-related violence.
However, while it's easier to think of us, the citizens, the police, the army, as the good guys, and them, the narcos, the carteles, as the bad guys, if you think about it, the latter are only providing a service to the former.
If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence, you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north.
This leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.
And so because they didn't have access to the more profitable drug markets, this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime.
The Knights Templar realized very quickly that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone, and so they developed a strategy as a social enterprise.
They started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the U.S.
The third thing I want you to remember is that even though we're more comfortable with this idea of "them," a set of bad guys separated from us, we are actually accomplices to them, either through our direct consumption or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption.
We also, like a lot of companies, create a product that's based on technology trends.
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important; we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.
The first is the critical price.
And it started to take off. And you can see that the units started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.
Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.
They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods.
Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price.
At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.
You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards. This is a tipping point -- if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics, and the speed, and the players in the industry.
You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there, but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element, the physical element, of songs off the table.
It's seven cents a minute, in many cases.
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.
They use Mobutu as metaphor.
And so we need both the market and we need aid.
And so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time, takes a lot of patience.
As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization, has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average, but this didn't happen overnight.
We're starting to see these happening all around the world.
And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important.
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund, we could use this time to invest not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing, nor in international experts, but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country.
On one of my last visits to Pakistan, I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.
Because he was building these crops.
Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental, and that power without love is reckless and abusive.
Rather than what we think that they might need.
You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha, where a blogger talked about how you hack, or break into, a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen, and it spread all over. Kryptonite had to adjust the lock, and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns.
And then you have something like this, which is Interplast.
They sent a search party, and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself, jumped off Bible Peak.
I like music, and I like banjos, and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing, and I said, "I could do that."
But I got emails from people that said, "Oh my God, your husband is such an asshole.
I don't want to write for this public audience.
Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms, and this is not something to be considered high art."
So Odin was documented every single day.
Millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people.
I would spend hours looking at just the connections, saying, "Oh, the little kid up at the top has red hair; so does that first generation up there."
This is the only picture I have. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs; to think about the people who are on those $100 computers talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing.
About four people probably read it, and they tell me, you know, "You haven't updated" -- I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated -- but this is something that's amazing, because I can go back to a day -- I can go back to April 2005, and say, what was I doing this day? I look at it, I know exactly.
She was writing and writing and writing, and we all started reading it, because we had so few blogs on the service, we could keep track of everyone.
So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action to all of you is: you know, think about blogs, think about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something that is really going to change our lives.
This is what one of nature's finest machines.
Now bluefin, in general, goes to one place: Japan.
Most of us from the ship -- even I -- look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.
We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts, or the same parts that are in your computer, chips.
Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
We're taking this data and building better models.
We bring the tuna out, we measure it.
In this case, what we're going to do is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.
We're going to do something that in recent years we've started: take a mucus sample.
Three tunas tagged.
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message.
And we'll place an acoustic tag that says, "OMSHARK 10165," or something like that, acoustically with a ping.
These elephant seals cover half an ocean, take data down to 1,800 feet -- amazing data.
So this is just three years of data right here -- and there's a decade of this data.
We did this with the Great Turtle Race -- tagged turtles, brought in four million hits.
And then finally -- to basically get the message home -- maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks.
Thank you.
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas.
I was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives.
So to the folks from Google, thank you.
I work at a university.
And I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo, and here we go all over again."
"I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee.
Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool.
These are the airports that I hang out in, because I like airports.
And after piecing together this, this and this, this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this, and it actually became this project.
I spend a lot of time on the road.
So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations, empty gas stations.
Every few moments I shoot the image.
So by me putting all this information out there, what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything.
And I understand that, on an individual level, it's purely symbolic.
This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis, whether we're aware of it or not.
And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there.
So thank you very much. I appreciate it.
I'd like to start by introducing you to someone whose life has been changed by a marketplace fueled by reputation.
Now let me show you these heat maps of Paris to see how insanely fast it's growing.
But the real magic and the secret source behind collaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb isn't the inventory or the money.
They're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant for the Facebook age.
And then he happened to stumble across a post about TaskRabbit.
Yes, there's actually a four-stage, rigorous interview process that's designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits.
Virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another face to face.
Now — -- I love that word, SuperRabbit.
I also want to be clear that this isn't about adding up tweets and likes and friends in a clout-like fashion.
Now, I realize that this concept may sound a little Big Brother to some of you, and yes, there are some enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve, but ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation, we can actually control it more, and extract the immense value that will flow from it.
Let me give you one example from the world of recruiting, where reputation data will make the résumé seem like an archaic relic of the past.
You know, it's very interesting.
In the 21st century, new trust networks, and the reputation capital they generate, will reinvent the way we think about wealth, markets, power and personal identity, in ways we can't yet even imagine.
And so what I'd like to do today is change your views, change your ideas and your thoughts about sleep.
This is from Thomas Edison, from the beginning of the 20th century.
Well, it's because you don't do anything much while you're asleep, it seems.
So why do we sleep?
Again, perhaps intuitive.
So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important.
It's not even an upgrade from economy to first class.
If we think about other sectors of society, the aged, if you are aged, then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted, and many sleep, again, less than five hours a night.
Now, micro-sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing, but they can also be deadly.
And of course, you're fueling the waking state with these stimulants, and then of course it gets to 11 o'clock at night, and the brain says to itself, "Ah, well actually, I need to be asleep fairly shortly.
What's the connection here?
So most of us, of course, ask the question, "Well, how do I know whether I'm getting enough sleep?"
We stand in a massively lit bathroom looking into the mirror cleaning our teeth.
Teenagers are lazy. No. Poor things.
And the fourth myth is, early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
Lots of groups, several groups are studying conditions like depression, schizophrenia and bipolar, and what's going on in terms of sleep disruption.
And what's the evidence for that?
In terms of the neuroscience, by understanding the neuroscience of these two systems, we're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain.
This is a pragmatic response to good health.
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.
But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big.
It's an extraordinarily close correlation.
What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing.
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital, very similar relationships closely related to inequality.
This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year.
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime.
And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA.
It has a smaller welfare state.
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.
I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality.
Now we have been criticized.
Why don't we control for other factors?
We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top.
And that was the very first time that I found an opportunity to feel that I was able to express my own voice, and that's what's fueled me, then, to become a choreographer.
And we all know what that body is like in the real world, so one of the aspects of physical thinking that we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception, the sense of my own body in the space in the real world.
I can absolutely walk around it when I see it, yeah?
So I have to get myself in the zone. Right.
You can see the speed is extremely quick, yeah?
So they're solving this problem for me, having a little -- They're constructing that phrase.
Yeah, down to the floor. Can you go underneath?
Kick, replace, change a leg. Kick, replace, change the leg.
Imagine that there's a circle in front of you, yeah?
So yeah, okay, good. Okay, nice, very nice.
So just keep working on them for a little second.
Here it comes, Cat.
B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future.
You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.
There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.
So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years.
This is neat.
The acid will ruin the gold plating.
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out.
So I type "design emotion" and my website wasn't first again.
So that's my new life; it's all about fun.
And I couldn't force myself across that.
Still can't reach it.
But in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done because you'd be working along and say, "Oh, I got a new way of doing it."
We dislike bitter tastes, we dislike loud sounds, we dislike hot temperatures, cold temperatures.
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.
There's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that.
And the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?"
If you want a more positive model -- this is the GM car.
So, it's pitting one against the other.
In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas -- it's like four pieces of a puzzle.
If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.
So the principal looks at it and says, 3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.
And this is what we saw.
So it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there; he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.
So we thought that this is what was happening: that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet -- and came back three months later.
Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.
I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.
But we got a clean learning curve, almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.
If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.
Can technology alter the acquisition of values?
And learning is most likely a self-organizing system.
So I want to leave that as a thought with you.
Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship.
You can get on your Kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone.
And those startups are focused on what they are, not what they're not, until one day Athletepath, which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes, found this video.
It turned into a 24-hour contest.
Because back to the whole relationship issue, what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not, or it can remind me of why I should love you.
I was fascinated by the Cold War, by the INF negotiations over intermediate-range nuclear missiles, the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.
Being a diplomat, then and now, is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it -- I enjoyed the status of it.
It was really interesting.
I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the 12th of September 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before, which were, of course, deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time.
And I decided to take some time out from work.
And indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear that Iraq's WMD did not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us.
And it was like that for me. I love that movie.
A second thing happened in Kosovo, which kind of delivered the answer, which I couldn't really answer, which is, "What do I do with my life?"
And funnily enough, they were frustrated about that.
They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process, which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo.
Independent Diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world, and we're advising seven or eight different countries, or political groups, depending on how you wish to define them -- and I'm not big on definitions.
And one thing led to another, and I ended up having a desk in ?What If! in New York, when I started Independent Diplomat.
The personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing, and I recommend it.
Us.
There aren't neat examples, but one example is this: the way the world is changing is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work -- the U.N. Security Council.
This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected.
And my politics has changed fundamentally from when I was a diplomat to what I am today, and I think that outputs is what matters, not process, not technology, frankly, so much either.
The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day.
Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV.
That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom.
We went back 50 years to the 1959/1960 television season.
So I really hope our global audiences can relate.
Right at the end of the 60s, moral ambiguity is going up, inspiration is kind of on the wane.
Take a look at this.
Comfort is no longer why we watch television.
Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago.
Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts: unemployment.
We had the bursting of the tech bubble.
I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing.
Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood.
I'm so excited, I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans.
I'm totally clueless.
Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make.
So now we have a whole extended bacteria family, filled with virus sleeper cells.
So when my students were first learning this, why did they hate it so much?
Now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible.
And after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation, they'd find fault with almost every word I've used, and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough, and they'd have to change everything that wasn't 100 percent perfect.
And you're like, "Actually, shut up!
If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA, that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science.
There's still so much work left to be done, though, and if you're involved with science in any way I urge you to join me.
Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms, most of which we're very familiar with.
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die.
Others use dancing, spinning and circling to promote self-transcendence.
Here's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase.
Now profane is the opposite of sacred.
Durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum, of making a group out of individuals.
Is it a product of natural selection, like our hands?
He said, "If the one tribe included a great number of courageous, sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other, this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other."
Let me illustrate this for you.
And in short order, the cooperators are done for.
And now let's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters and look what happens.
These early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere.
Do you think they're there pursuing their self-interest?
If it is an adaptation, then we evolved to be religious.
We're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment.
One great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top.
As I was building this space, I thought to myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own."
And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.
There were definitely hang-out spots.
All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.
Museum quality.

You come into this major airport, and they simply have a B.
You know, it's pretty clear.
And I said, well, that's fine; I just would love to have your input on this film and this book, and he finally agreed to it.
This is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says, "The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.
So, what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material?
So, a couple spreads from the book: here McLuhan says, "The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature."
There was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the '60s Cuban missile crisis.
I've taken one shot; I cropped it a few different ways.
And it was purposely done to look fairly serious.
It was a worldwide branding campaign.
This is some work from Ray Gun.
Having done a lot of magazines, I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories, and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9/11.
And this continued through the entire magazine.
This is my desktop.
What's next? What's next is going to be people.
I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles, and you get charged by this thing and you go, oh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.
Why not experiment? Why not have some fun?
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.
And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.
So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.
Every single thing that we can think of -- and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits, you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life, because every single one of them is hacking something about it.
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.
And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.
There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.
Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non-technology, or even life.
This is his chart, which is not quite published yet.
It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along.
So what's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks, are increasing. And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.
There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang, what it expanded was the potential for difference.
And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented -- what a loss to society there would be.
It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields, but it's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.
And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved, so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.
Now, lethally autonomous killer robots would take many forms -- flying, driving, or just lying in wait.
Power was focused at the very top.
Now we saw an example of this in 2011 when an American RQ-170 Sentinel drone got a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack, but any remotely-piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack, and that means drones will have to shoulder more decision-making.
It could make military action a viable option not just for small nations, but criminal organizations, private enterprise, even powerful individuals.
Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals.
And ideas achieving critical mass is what political activism in popular government is all about.
And we need it now, before there's a devastating attack or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world to rush to adopt these weapons before thinking through the consequences.
And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones, and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down, they should notify humans to their presence.
Thank you.
It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.
So I literally came back from that job, quit school, hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.
And not uniquely but certainly, the octopus in Australia are masters at camouflage.
And they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging, but this particular one used vision.
And I can't say octopus are responsible for my really strong interest in getting in subs and going deep, but whatever the case, I like that.
And now you've entered the realm of the mid-water community.
In fact, this whole area is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings.
And it completely threw science on its head.
You think, "Well, what happened?"
Five years later, come back, and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.
I've been to a lot of lectures where, at the end of it, inevitably, one of the first questions that comes up is, "But, but what can I do?
And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map, little dots on a map.
And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment, like those people changed the health of that bay.
Interpreter: By making myself invisible, I try to explore and question the contradictory and often inter-canceling relationship between our civilization and its development.
It refers to those people who lost their jobs during China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy.
I found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions.
This one is called Instant Noodles.
There is no Photoshop involved.
I was afraid of womanhood.
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.
Not only that -- we always have this vague notion that something's expected of us.
Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos.
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking, "Well, why don't I do something?
And not only that, it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect, but through the heart.
However, cities, despite having this negative aspect to them, are also the solution.
I must say, many of the indicators look like this is what it's going to look like, but let's talk about it.
Is Microsoft a great big anthill?
That is, you ask any generic question about this -- how many trees of a given size, how many branches of a given size does a tree have, how many leaves, what is the energy flowing through each branch, what is the size of the canopy, what is its growth, what is its mortality?
Here's how you grew.
Very, very bad for economies and companies and cities in our present paradigm.
Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe, there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this.
The bigger you are systematically, according to very well-defined rules, less energy per capita.
This shows that in this very simple example, which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size -- plotted in the same way as the biology -- you see exactly the same kind of thing.
It's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on.
And you can see, they all follow the same line.
Something universal is going on.
This is what we had in biology, just to repeat.
So there's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse.
We could use sales, anything you like.
But you notice, I've cheated, because I've only gone up to '94.
I could get access to it.
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.
And they will step up.
The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful, and they know what to do with it.
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy, which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia.
So we did this project, and this is one of the artifacts of the project.
And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."
I want to start with this slide, because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.
Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty, and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.
This is from "The Untied States of America."
And you can actually -- -- we won't get into that.
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
I'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment.
How can we do that?
Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh -- about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers, we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment, which is amputation, if you can't heal it.
This is a horse. The horse is not in pain.
This is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.
Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early, and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.
So you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.
The good news is that this is happening today.
So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.
And I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot, at the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.
And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.
Well my characters, like the ones in my shows, allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.
Oh my! There's so many of you.
Frankly, I'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.
Oh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.
But anyway, you know, I just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people -- literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.
Thank you for all that you do.
But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here, but I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.
Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.
And the organization is called DA BOMB, A\and DA BOMB -- not like what you guys can build and everything -- it's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican -- it's an acronym -- Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.
So, I think all people, we need that, but especially, I look at people like me, you know like, I mean, Latinos -- we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.
It's a long story, believe me.
Although, you know, it was wonderful.
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED, I said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know -- before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people, much less like this because I did not like to give speeches because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.
My son, he says he is not ready to get married.
So I said, "What's wrong in this picture?"
But at first I did not know what to do.
It is not Harvard.
I want to hold your hand.
Thank you all very much. It was lovely.
And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.
But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.
I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living, so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent, so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.
And while I was there, I made friends with a fellow named Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize for this. This is a photo from the old days.
And around that time, I met John Gardner, who is a remarkable man.
But there's also a lot of people that you don't know.
And celebrate them: tell their stories, because not only are there good people doing good work, but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.
"The surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business."
And we had an online component of that, our community sect called Participate.net.
It was also a pretty good year for this guy.
We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.
And I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."
And by the time I was an intern house officer, I could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car -- and I was a paid doctor.
And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos, that's a taxi, and you have police on them.
I'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?
You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty.
All right, this is a slide from a talk I gave about intensive care units in Nigeria, and jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare."
I got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K.
The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray, it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.
Her condition, open-heart surgery that as she required, would have been treated when she was a child.
No? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked.
That's exactly how the outlets are designed.
If you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much.
African people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope.
The next day, all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island, where he was going to give a conference to the world's press, standing in front of his former prison cell.
They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus.
In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart, the whole nature, of this terrible tragedy that is taking place, that people are tending to avoid, because they are fatigued, and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.
The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015.
Avelile's mother had HIV virus -- she died from AIDS-related illness.
And I'm getting -- the hairs on my -- I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.
So I begin with an advertisement inspired by George Orwell that Apple ran in 1984.
His app wasn't reinstated until he won the Pulitzer Prize.
And their decisions about software coding, engineering, design, terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.
The reality is that even in democratic societies today, we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks.
And that's done in part with the help from Western technology.
So we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the Internet, which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services.
But then he goes and champions laws like the infamous "three-strikes" law that would disconnect citizens from the Internet for file sharing, which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens' right to communications, and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.
This set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation, which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed -- which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in America across the pond.
And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity.
This event meant a great deal to me personally.
They used to get great apartments in the center of town, casual sex on tap, and they could travel to the West very freely, which was a great luxury at the time.
And what I noticed at the beginning of my research that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world.
Take Mexico, for example.
Now, let me show you some of my friends in action, caught conveniently on film by the Italian police, and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes.
And this is very important, because the only way you can catch these guys is if they run out of gas.
In the 1990s, we saw financial centers around the world competing for their business, and there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering.
Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now.
The United Nations recognized earlier this -- it was last month actually -- that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs.
What they've done is they've shifted their operations.
One thing that we do know that the Internet is doing is the Internet is assisting these guys.
They affect our communications, our pension funds.
And all over the world, eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this.
They, that one, is hairy and walking on four legs.
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass, or to chase after animals, or to free our hands for weapons.
Some of it even came from lianas, those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.
You've got this beautiful paradigm.
And the only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions.
You must never do that again."
I mean, look at the elephant.
As an absolute connection, it only works one way.
Look at the fat layer.
We can speak.
And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own, which they've all agreed on, and they love.
Everybody likes the aquatic theory.
Some of them have come over.
Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas will be blended together.
The professional journals won't touch it with a barge pole.
He says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence it's been trained to receive."
And luckily he agreed. And the theme, in two years, is going to be "Cute Pictures Of Puppies."
The fund was deposited as a family reassure, in a safe, reliable security company in Dakar, Senegal, where I was only given temporary asylum.
Mark Serfaas. It's pretty cool, huh? Pursuing happiness.
Really cool, we were getting wasted.
Ze Frank: Oh. Amazing.
I hear a lot of you whispering.
ZF: You get off the stage.
This is called "Atheist."
So, I made this for TED. It's "Christian."
We're in a culture of guru-ship. It's so hard to use some software because, you know, it's unapproachable, people feel like they have to read the manual.
And eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it, or draw, you know, they draw penises and things like that.
So this is called the "Fiction Project." This is an online space, which is -- it's basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank.
Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone, "Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."
Even the top dog himself takes time every day to read 10 letters that are picked out by staff.
Now, when you approach these animals, you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them, and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.
Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.
Because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature: that you have influence in a large sphere, and that my preservation depends on you.
I got this letter when I was first elected, and I still carry it to every council meeting I go to.
Anna Deavere Smith famously said that there's a literature inside of each of us, and three generations later, I was part of a project called StoryCorps, which set out to capture the stories of ordinary Americans by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces.
[Michael Wolmetz with his girlfriend Debora Brakarz] Michael Wolmetz: So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother, and we can leave it there.
Or this individual piece here, you can see the actual bedroom. It really changes the way you think about this type of a tempera painting.
So more and more we're trying to find ways for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves, to be creative even as they're looking at other people's creativity and understanding them.
But that was coupled together with this oral histories booth, really the simplest we've ever made, where you locate yourself on a map.
And so we started imagining the museum, along with the creative team at the museum and the curators, thinking about how the first voice that you would hear inside the museum would actually be of other visitors.
Voice 11: When I heard it over the radio -- Voice 12: Heard it on the radio.
And we tell the stories of being inside the towers through that same audio collage, so you're hearing people literally talking about seeing the planes as they make their way into the building, or making their way down the stairwells.
So I'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices, but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event.
And so when you go to the memorial, you can actually see the overarching organization inside of the individual pools themselves.
Everybody's got one -- all of you.
And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else.
What kind of an experience do they have?
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.
And so jumping off of that, thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world, I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls -- which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols.
They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier.
This very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier.
So if you've been following the news, you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids headed for the United States, all scheduled to strike within the next 50 years.
Now then we get the Great Depression and World War II.
What's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party?
Large-scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet.
As you see, temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations.
We begin separating everything into good versus evil.
It used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in Congress.
Well, in the last 12 years it's become much more apparent that it is.
It plummets. Something is going on here.
So there are a lot of reforms we could do that will counteract this.
Should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up and descends into paralysis and polarization?
This is where we are as a country.
Well, one of the largest causes, after globalization, is actually this fourth asteroid, rising non-marital births.
Now let me be clear. I'm not blaming the women here.
But if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders, we'd see that these two problems actually are best addressed together.
In the Asteroids Club, we don't start by looking for common ground.
Now this is a social disaster, and liberals are very concerned about this.
And this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way.
This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living.
And that's the shell around that globular fat.
It looks beautiful.
Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea, and is built upon wooden piles.
We've observed this in the laboratory.
So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way.
I've spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals.
'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,' I moan.
I hasten to add that it's my experience, because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way.
Often, speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence.
But we didn't get far before I was talking in ways that made no sense.
Come to the Florida sunshine bush, where there are lemons, where they make demons.' 'You're frightening me,' one of them said, and Rebel and Val headed back into the library.
Continuing with the writings: "The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment, and I began gibbering unintelligably as I had the night before, and he eventually brought me to the emergency room.
At times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints, arms tied, arms and legs tied down, arms and legs tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest.
They're different from me and you.
He was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness.
Hospitals are bad, they're mad, they're sad.
These relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth, and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of symptoms.
Also, we must stop criminalizing mental illness.
My psychosis, on the other hand, is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying that all my angels have already fled.
Like this.
Since, our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves -- any street in California.
Oh, my God.
The reasons vary state to state, but mostly in the details.
Well, it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like Montana.
And the senior water rights holders, if they don't use their water right, they risk losing their water right, along with the economic value that goes with it.
They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water, they're trying to be really efficient with their water use, and they're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand.
So how can they address this remaining water footprint?
So, working with local water trusts, we created an incentive to do so.
Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate, and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems.
We've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in Montana, with hotels and tea companies in Oregon and with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest.
I was ending middle school, starting high school -- I'm a sophomore now — and I was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you're told you can't be when you're growing up as a girl.
So I'm not saying, "Be like us," and "We're perfect role models," because we're not, but we just want to help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimensions.
So what does the happiest man in the world look like?
Perhaps something very naughty.
Because if compassion was a chore, nobody's going to do it, except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.
Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes -- in Google, my company.
So in other words, it almost always starts from the bottom up.
There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts.
And they, according to the research, make the best business leaders.
So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration, initiative and creativity.
So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.
So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work?
What does that mean?
And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace.
He was not a political prisoner.
So in the year 2000, I began to wonder, what if we came together?
But it is in so many countries.
For example, in Cambodia, it was that [inaudible name] did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together. And in the same way, in China, they always tell me, "It's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together."
I said, "I'm gonna copy this."
It's not only Innocent, who I told you about in Zimbabwe, but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces.
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel.
Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province. But because he was born in the prison, everybody loved him, including the guards, so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars.
Thank you.
And I basically live my life in sort of a trance, and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story.
I'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal.
It's really interesting: what many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of this kind of overdesigned -- in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but -- decoration, interior decoration.
But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929, which is to try and see what's going on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make things better.
And you see IDEO there.
There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime, but I don't want to focus on my shows.
And then when 9/11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition until, slowly but surely, it came back -- as a half-full glass instead of half-empty -- and it was about protection and safety.
Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia, like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away; or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States -- I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA; or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations.
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury, and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality.
But it surely is a very important moment for design, because not only is the technology proceeding, not only is computing technology making open-source possible also in the world of design, but also the idea of sustainability -- which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint, but also sustainability of human interrelationships -- is very much part of the work of so many designers.
And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.
I mean, we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.
I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire, but I know what it is to grow up without having money, or being able to support family.
You know, someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees, and when they started getting pretty strict, you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.
And my father said, "OK, listen.
Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.
And when I went online and looked at the infectious -- read about the disease, I pretty much realized what was going on.
You don't see the other side of me.
He was like, I try and I make.
So we need to start getting better.
Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers?
And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be, should I move back, should I stay?
But there is such a need, you know?
We have a comment function, where people can ask their MPs questions.
We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars, you know?
I was paying her school fees.
He called me to his office and said, "What do you want to do when you grow up?"
Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard for applying to law school.
A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential.
I come from Lebanon, and I believe that running can change the world.
I nearly died, was in a coma, stayed at the hospital for two years, and underwent 36 surgeries to be able to walk again.
So we had to start from scratch.
So did our political problems.
Thank you.
After all, peacemaking is not a sprint.
I was, in fact, busy trying to finish off my Ph.D., which was in a completely unrelated area of how people interact, contributors interact, how articles are formed in Wikipedia -- trying to figure out how quality emerges from the system.
I was waiting, and when he did emerge, he was ashen-faced.
Five minutes away from there, I had the center, the medical center, which was distributing subsidized iron tablets.
Now this struck me as -- I love to fix things. I wanted to fix this.
We knew it had to be these three things that the machine had to have.
And I have it here in my purse.
And by the time I'm done, in 2020, when the WHO publishes the data again, this is going to be the map of anemia.
Now obviously, as Maddie's chemistry teacher, I love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class.
This led to open-heart surgery. This is the actual real email from my doctor right there.
Questions can be windows to great instruction, but not the other way around.
All right. Sorry.
But the challenge is really for Riley's future teachers, the ones she has yet to meet.
And of course, most of you have had three meals today, and probably will continue to have after this event.
Most people died around the age of 50.
It's 1.7 million people.
Now that is historic. It's never happened before in history.
How could we survive that?
Do you worry much?
On the other hand, there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors.
Indeed there is.
And we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water.
Thank you very much.
So what's new in it? What seems to be very new, which is the idea I would like to share with you today, that there is a set of rules and skills which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle.
The same Generation Epsilon with their rules, with their tools, with their games and with their language, which sounds a little bit strange to me. I am 38 now.
Well, the news here is that your skills [that you] bring in the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions, namely skills of unity, planning, and maintaining nonviolent discipline.
So unity is a big thing, and this can be achieved.
There are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow.
The world has just changed the picture, but somebody was thinking about this previously.
And you know, we were just a small group of crazy students in Serbia when we made this big skit.
There is also one big thing about the humor: It really hurts, because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously.
This is the difference between two towns.
The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch.
It was not really you.
And she said, "Yeah."
And I said, "I'm just thinking about it a little bit."
And that myth is profoundly dangerous.
And so many of the calls went like this, "Hey, Dr. Brown. We loved your TEDTalk.
The second thing, in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage, the second thing I learned is this: We have to talk about shame.
And I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic, no one wants to talk about it.
And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there.
And all-powerful folks don't need checklists.
You know what the big secret about TED is?
There's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt.
You never finished that MBA. Your wife left you.
Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.
And here's what you even need to know more.
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study.
And don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads, because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else."
If we're going to find our way back to each other, we have to understand and know empathy, because empathy's the antidote to shame.
We want you to go in.
There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics in the field of building gliders.
So here is one without a skin.
We have to turn it, go up and go down.
Markus, I think that we should fly it once more.
And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals, predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers as a hub-and-spoke model.
An implicit faith in you and then you respond to it.
He wanted to create a franchise, a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of McDonald's.
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice, and that's very important because I think glasses, in addition to helping people see, is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera, and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating, and then you see on the other side, another patient is getting ready.
So the final part of the puzzle is, how do you make all this work financially, especially when the people can't pay for it?
We created competition for ourselves, and then we made eye care affordable by making low-cost consumables.
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.
Thank you very much.
Now, I have three options that I would like to show you.
It can tell you by its weight, "Okay, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here."
If you change the grasp, it can adjust to that.
Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive?
So, what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us.
But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom, people's reaction completely changed towards me.
And the incredibly unexpected thing is that other people seem to see and feel that too.
When I was a small boy, I took my pledge as an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste the natural resources of my country, its air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.
By mid-century we'll be about 80 percent urban, and that's mostly in the developing world, where that's happening.
Well, what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.
The aggregate numbers now are that basically squatters, all one billion of them, are building the urban world, which means they're building the world -- personally, one by one, family by family, clan by clan, neighborhood by neighborhood.
And that's how they work.
You look at that lane on the right.
The informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics: it's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.
And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops to send food to the new growing markets in town.
The immediately have fewer children.
The climate news, I'm sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse than we think, faster than we think.
Of those, only nuclear and hydro are green.
And it puts 18 thousand tons of carbon dioxide in the air.
But frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on, might serve even better.
And the innovation is moving very rapidly.
They're good for the environment because they enable no-till farming, which leaves the soil in place, getting healthier from year to year -- slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere.
So this is very interesting diplomacy coming along.
Nobel Prize-winning climatologist Paul Crutzen calls our geological era the Anthropocene, the human-dominated era. We are stuck with its obligations.
They're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.
I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico, because I'm Canadian, and I can draw no ancestral ties.
As with BP, the hole does get plugged, at least temporarily, but not before exacting a tremendous price.
Or we ask, "How much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive?
For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker taking home 100 times more than a brain surgeon, then you need a narrative, you need a story that makes that disparity okay.
So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides -- for society at least.
A new bubble will replace the old one.
How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin?
The truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era, the era of extreme energy.
So to get at it, you first have to get rid of the trees.
Vast, vivid landscapes are being gutted, left monochromatic gray.
Now, you may have noticed more and more headlines like these.
Most importantly, we don't have to change our lifestyles after all.
Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.
BF: Oh, Daniel.
BF: First try? Once on purpose?
BF: I think that's the next session.
RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them, the things that have happened to me -- I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.
Have him hold your wrist so I can ...
BF: I think we were just outside.
BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool.
DH: True. Barry ...
DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage?
DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ...
DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.
DH: Whenever you're ready.
BF: Well, you know ...
DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.
BF: Nice.
Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do?
Because now, to make this twice as difficult, we'll juggle the seven clubs back ...
The first computer was really designed in the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.
Every time he had a good idea, he'd think, "That's brilliant, I'm going to start building that one.
It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal.
It could do the "if then" for basic programmers, and that fundamentally made it into a computer.
Babbage, of course, wanted to use proven technology, so steam and things.
It's completely mechanical, again, a printer.
Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training, and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother, and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.
It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical, like Babbage's was, or electronic, like computers are today, or perhaps in the future, cells, or, again, mechanical again, once we get into nanotechnology.
So, where does that bring us today?
But in between that we're going to do a simulation.
I came here to speak about ecology, and I emitted as much CO2 as a Frenchman in one year.
Oil sand is not a long-term solution.
The thickness of the Arctic decreased more than 40 percent since 1960.
According to FAO, if we don't change our system of fishing the main sea resources will be gone in 2050.
Today we have 20 million refugees in the world.
Eighth I had a big laugh today.
You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work.
And I think that comes from connecting with nature, connecting with the energy of life, because we're all disabled in some way on the planet -- spiritually, mentally or physically.
Now I am going to speak to you about my movie.
For generations, we've been raising our children, not unlike millions of other species living beside us.
Half of the world's forests have vanished.
We all have the power to change this trend for the better.
We have to believe what we know.
In 2003, the final version was published, and they keep working on it.
That's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in 1998, waiting until 2011, and now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice.
So a woman is age 37.
And it's because of people like my colleague, Rick Wilson, at the Genome Institute at Washington University, who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem.
Significant problems remained.
That's how fast this is moving.
And after nine months of grueling recovery, he's now eating steak with A1 sauce.
And in fact, the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing.
Now think of it, it's 2016 and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back tax returns, but also her personal genome.
And they all moved to different parts of the planet.
Okay, so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child.
I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here, who is a volunteer donor.
So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years.
No robots required.
This was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.
It may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier, to use in the future should you need it.
And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities, just like a coral.
It's as if each of us, like Schrödinger here, are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities.
This energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles, with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties.
There's a whole zoo of subatomic particles.
The strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge, called color charge, and come in three different varieties: red, green and blue.
That's a lot of particles to keep track of.
This is called the Unified Electroweak Model, and it was put together back in 1967.
At this point, anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero.
We want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone, and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada.
A physicist looks for larger, more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset.
It's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group, E8.
From their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle, but have color charge and interact with the strong force.
But it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure, beautiful geometry.
This theory and others like it are long shots.
And I try to live in beautiful places.
Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times, but it's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with.
Is it bigger? Is it smaller?
But thank you so much for coming. That was absolutely fascinating.
It's kind of commonplace now, but his argument was -- because he'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.
Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more, although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.
They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.
And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild, have helped -- more than anything else -- to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from, the amazing animals with whom we share the planet.
It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.
And as a result of this program, something's happening for conservation.
Today, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here, but the developed world -- major decisions involving millions of dollars, and millions of people, are often based on, "How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?"
We've talked about the soil erosion.
And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.
Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.
So one of their projects will be to help their own human community.
It's being used in Uganda to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.
Do you really have hope?" Well, yes.
Do we care about their future?
Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies, and although people around the world tried their best, was executed.
And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people, when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action, to make the world a better place, truly are our hope for tomorrow.
And so I was always asking this question: "Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn?"
You make me go to this. You make me listen.
It simply means that they believe it's important to do it.
And so it is especially significant that the university I now lead, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC, was founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King, in 1963.
It's great work.
That's a big deal. Give me a hand for that. That's a big deal.
And so doing things to help students prepare to be in that position, very important.
Every foundation makes the difference in the next level.
There was fire in that belly.
As you know, it's one thing to earn an A yourself, it's another thing to help someone else do well.
They were looking at this amazing protein design.
Give him a big hand for that.
And it's working so well that throughout our university system in Maryland, more and more courses are being redesigned.
Aristotle said, "Excellence is never an accident.
And my intention was to go out to the gyre, raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic, chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities.
So I came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue, and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
So this is a big issue for us.
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so, save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.
I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time.
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab, he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken, sort through them and organize them, and re-size them, etc., again using all natural gestures.
He can ask for additional information.
As you interact with someone at TED, maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages.
Through that and through human rights groups, we were brought together with several other victims' families.
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.
So the story with Zacarias was too much really.
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together.
"Why did we want to meet her?"
I never had met someone with such a hard life, from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other.
I talked a lot in the past about statistics, and the provision of safe drinking water for all.
However, after a few failed prototypes, I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.
Would you like to see that?
We're just going to pour that in there.
You just scoop the water up.
There we go. Mind the electrics.
And when it's expired, using failsafe technology, the system will shut off, protecting the user.
The problem just becomes self-perpetuating.
All we've go to do is make it sterile. How do we do that?
But what Housman understood, and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too, was that the long, hot, silvan summers of stability of the 19th century were coming to a close, and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes.
And the first of these, the first two of these, is about a shift in power.
The international stage and the global stage where power now resides: the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters, the power of the money changers -- this vast money-go-round that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance -- the money changers, if you like, the financial speculators that have brought us all to our knees quite recently, the power of the multinational corporations now developing budgets often bigger than medium-sized countries.
Now notice, I'm not talking about government.
Kyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty-based organization.
Now that begins with economic power, but that's the way it always begins.
And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up -- in China, of course, though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth.
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances.
How many Chinese troops are serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag, serving under the U.N. command in the world today?
Today in our modern world, because of the Internet, because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here, everything is connected to everything.
And what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone, not connected with others, not working with others, is no longer a viable proposition.
It tells you that, in fact, our governments, vertically constructed, constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution -- vertical hierarchy, specialization of tasks, command structures -- have got the wrong structures completely.
Suddenly and for the very first time, collective defense, the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations, is no longer enough.
I started with a poem, I'll end with one.
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.
When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?
So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won the genetic lottery.
And every time they turn themselves over there is some damage. And that damage builds up.
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease, heart disease, cancer and diabetes.
Their diet is mostly plant-based, accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.
That's called the grandmother effect.
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer, big killers here in America.
They also have a 3,000-year-old adage, which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.
If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa, you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life.
And she put her head back and she said, "It feels like leaping into heaven."
And they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity, comparatively speaking.
Genesis: Chapter one, Verse [29], where God talks about legumes and seeds, and on one more stanza about green plants, ostensibly missing is meat.
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old.
Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here.
And we managed to boil it down to nine.
That's physical activity.
You know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born, because of infant mortality, and the year you retire.
I have a friend in Portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family.
Conductive ink has been used by artists, but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens.
So I'm a social scientist by training, so why am I here today talking about smart materials?
First of all, because we can't shape what we don't understand, and what we don't understand and use ends up shaping us.
Jordan then published his results online, including all the things he had tried and didn't work, so others could study and reproduce it.
Just like Jordan and so many other makers, Hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them.
Thank you.
This guy is stopping, dead stop, dead stop on the highway.
Occasionally we sense something wrong or too late.
How can you predict the future? That's really hard.
You'll know, because your car will know, because that other car will have whispered something in his ear, like, "By the way, five minutes, motorcyclist, watch out."
What happens if two cars share that data, if they talk to each other?
You prioritize the one guy who seems to be going a little off course.
And now, using a series of three cameras, we can detect if a driver is looking forward, looking away, looking down, on the phone, or having a cup of coffee.
By sharing our data willingly, we can do what's best for everyone.
We have something called the Genome 100 -- 100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.
And what he said, for me, was very moving.
We had everything all set in case of an emergency; God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.
They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible.
So we have an opportunity to really open up education.
So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.
They cause different things to happen inside the cell.
Once we figure out all that's going on -- and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on -- once we figure out what's going on, we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health, with what we do with future generations, and how long we're going to live.
But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.
Food rotted in the heat.
And I don't know when or how it happened, but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman, living in a van, took my breath away.
Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless, but I did.
So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.
I was no longer homeless.
Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot, and today I'm speaking at TED.
In my country, that was the case in 1974.
We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?"
Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom, I for IUD, V for vasectomy.
And before long, the condom was know as the girl's best friend.
And then we thought we'd help America, because America's been helping everyone, whether they want help or not.
Obviously, he's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.
Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand, and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS.
And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?"
And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys, and they were terrific.
We found -- you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction, but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.
And then finally, in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God, so instead, we say, "In rubber we trust."
So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.
They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund, which we call the Village Development Bank.
Make these better, because we can afford them."
We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development.
And we also ask the next Olympics to be involved in saving lives.
So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use, whether you're eight or 80.
So I can see everything that Romo sees, and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world.
And finally, because Romo is an extension of me, I can express myself through his emotions.
So you can log in through the browser, and it's kind of like Skype on wheels.
This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want.
To be honest, I have no idea.
All stories interest me, and some haunt me until I end up writing them.
This would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag.
However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.
But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren, the universal symbol of beauty and passion.
At some point around midnight, we were summoned to the wings of the stadium, and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started -- by the way, the same music that starts here, the Aida March.
So here's a tale of passion.
She names the twins after the camp's commanders to gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them.
No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist -- although the term had not reached Chile yet, so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.
Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting, and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.
The first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars.
The woman's face looks like a watermelon.
Empowering them will change everything -- more than technology and design and entertainment.
They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power, in the voluminous Botero style.
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization.
Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves and get to work, passionately, in creating an almost perfect world.
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either.
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land.
As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.
And if we look at what those settlements were like, we see they were compact.
And if you look at the name of one of those streets, Bread Street, you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago.
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.
So this was obviously an organic city, part of an organic cycle.
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.
We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.
It's not a new question.
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.
So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.
Thank you very much.
You don't want to sell too early, because you miss out on profits, but you don't want to wait too late to when everyone else sells, triggering a crash.
Just like in language and other domains, we know that it's hard for people to parse very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure.
This is a beautiful data set of 9,000 people who wrote in to three newspapers and magazines that had a contest.
But they lose, right?
And these are all areas which are fairly reliably known to be part of what's called a "theory of mind" circuit, or "mentalizing circuit."
The twist is that one player, on the left, is informed about how much on each trial there is.
We have some other data where they play across computers.
This turns out to be something that's predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at CalTech and learn about.
This is from the first two seconds.
They're hairy, smelly, fast and strong.
So this is an amazing memory test from Nagoya, Japan, Primate Research Institute, where they've done a lot of this research.
Right? Who thinks you could beat the chimps?
They're going to press left or right.
What about humans? You think you're smarter than a chimpanzee?
For years I've been feeling frustrated, because as a religious historian, I've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths.
Because with a few wonderful exceptions, very often when religious people come together, religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.
In Singapore, we have a group going to use the Charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society, and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically.
But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it.
I was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement.
We don't have to fall in love with each other, but we can become friends.
So, whenever given an opportunity, I try to do something in it or with it or for it.
Rome is a city full of surprises.
Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways.
Quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter, and very slow walking through Rome, you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across.
Unfortunately, just across the road from it or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius, and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression, as you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close, nudges it.
They keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori, which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace, which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon, and then is completely removed and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning.
Marcello, on the other hand, is sort of a lazy guy, but he's not due at work until about noon.
Marcello, as it turns out, is the driver of the number 64 bus, and if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter.
And then I thought, that's too complicated. No, I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale, so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space.
You can see that in 1635, it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever.
Here's a book completely wide open.
But it was the journey of the ...
But unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story.
So, these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon -- she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city.
We swoop down over the Campo de' Fiori.
And then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying, we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time, so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.
And if we can translate that into our built environment, then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.
So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into your parts.
On the right-hand side, [0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.
So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.
There's new programmability in these parts.
During his time at the American Museum of Natural History, Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions, like here in the Gobi Desert.
Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on Earth?
And if we started looking into that genetic information, we'd see a number of usual suspects out there -- of course, a lot of human genetic information, but also bacterial and viral information, mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose.
These deep sequencing tools are relatively new.
And I think if we phrase that lesson, it's something like this: Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story.
And the idea there is that outside the spaceship, the universe is implacably hostile, and inside is all we have, all we depend on.
And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe, is nowhere near any galaxies.
It's so dark that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you, and that star were to explode as a supernova, and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you, you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.
Well, what does that mean? Well, look out even further than we've just been -- I mean from here, with a telescope -- and you'll see things that look like stars.
Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well, but an explanatory model, embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure.
And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station, on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on.
But I have to tell you -- and sorry, Richard -- but I never did like biology field trips much, and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years.
Now I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in.
And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem, merely to postpone it by a little. So it's already too late to avoid it, and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger.
It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature, and with plans to live at the higher temperature -- and not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply. And some such plans exist, things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away, and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide.
These African students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they don't have any electricity at home.
The electric company in this nation operates under a rule, which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low, subsidized price -- in fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.
Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules?
It's not just that the rules are bad because the government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.
This next chart looks at more recent data.
Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Deng Xiaoping could copy, when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model.
Two: operate on the right scale.
And you'll need to attract families, the residents who will come and live there permanently, raise their children, get an education for their children, and get their first job.
People can come live under the new charter, but no one is forced to live under it.
This model is all about choices, both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.
Build -- run a special administrative zone.
Turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on Earth.
It would help to have a manual.
You could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police, the courts, but the school system and the health care system too, which make this a more attractive place to live, makes this a place where people have higher incomes -- which, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.
When we think about ideas in that way, we usually think about technologies.
We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours.
We started in Bermuda for our test project, then moved up to Halifax, working down the U.S. East Coast, the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal, through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific, and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean.
We filter through some simple apparatuses; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City.
Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes.
But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment.
This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.
I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.
Here's an actual picture of what happens: the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million rads of radiation.
Also, there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane.
I think future engineered species could be the source of food, hopefully a source of energy, environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry.
All right, start the clock please. 30 seconds studio.
"Okay. One bite. What the hell?"
And you do it automatically and non-consciously.
And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was.
You can be present-hedonistic, namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist -- it doesn't matter, your life is controlled.
What you get from the present hedonism is the energy, the energy to explore yourself, places, people, sensuality.
Told me don't eat that marshmallow, because if you wait you're going to get two of them, until I learned to balance out.
That's the idea behind The Long News.
But the top story of this past year was the economy, and I'm just betting that, sooner or later, this particular recession is going to be old news.
Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research.
And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula, which is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.
And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon, and, until Cassini had arrived there, was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system.
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people -- it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.
And there are features that look tectonic.
It was a moving demonstration of what the words "united nations" are supposed to mean: a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.
And you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge.
And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface, and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen, the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like, and having Earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity, and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the Earth itself.
And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels, we see that these jets feed a plume that, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles into the space above Enceladus.
It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space, and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe, and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.
For the last 8 years, I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means.
About seven years ago, they faced extinction, because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier, and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village.
We saw the men trying to push the soldiers, but none of them could do that.
It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.
The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance, convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line, which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
So they kept on going.
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus.
But help was coming.
And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere.
Here's the problem facing Homer.
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here.
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active, start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town.
And the cell on the right there fires whenever there's a boundary to the south, whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry, the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here, it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between.
Maybe it's been towed.
How do you explain when things don't go as we assume?
Why him?
I call it the golden circle.
What's your cause? What's your belief?
They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.
We believe in thinking differently.
Why would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company?
The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language.
And the best we can muster up is, "I don't know. It just doesn't feel right."
And back in the early 20th century, the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.
The New York Times followed him around everywhere, and everyone was rooting for Langley.
And lo and behold, look what happened.
And if you talk about what you believe, you will attract those who believe what you believe.
Well, you can trip over 10 percent of the customers.
Look at TiVo.
Because you see, when TiVo launched their product they told us all what they had.
They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to check the date.
And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people.
We followed, not for him, but for ourselves.
So my freshman year of college I signed up for an internship in the housing unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.
But over the course of these nine months, I grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients -- that by the time they came to us, they were already in crisis.
But the real issue is there's no food at home.
But the truth is I was devastated.
That if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly, that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare: that it keep us healthy.
So that's where Health Leads began.
And we gave it a shot.
Same thing in the clinic waiting room.
But what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously, the waiting room became the place where Health Leads turned your heat back on?
Now we may think that's good or bad, but in either case it's real.
