And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.
We made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy, and we made them unhealthy.
Because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn't be there, some very frightening things happen.
What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here, and they will accumulate in the drunkest, stingiest people.
They get into the food chain.
Those females, they're not trying to.
In fact, what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were.
It turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world.
But at least it's labeled correctly, and you're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead.
There's other ways of breaking the pyramid.
Often what jams us up is sewage.
Surfers, for example, know this incredibly.
Copepods are small crustaceans.
But in fact, if you look around the world, not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems, there have been places where problems have been fixed, where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around.
It didn't happen accidentally.
And it's only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves.
So it needed a very articulate front paw.
It's their kind of ur-story onstage, that desperation to live.
BJ: And it has these bulkheads made out of plywood, covered with fabric -- curiously similar, in fact, to the plywood canoes that Adrian's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop.
It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe.
The horse is sold to the First World War, and he joins up to find his horse.
The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head.
And we had a crate built for it.
Here I have an 18-second clip of the very first walk of the prototype.
You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there.
Joey.
Here, Craig is working the head.
Over here, Tommy's got what you call the heart position.
BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.
And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice, that I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space.
And it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in.
AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.
And it's incredible to watch, but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on; it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it.
It's a huge driver for culture and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.
They go to bed around 8:00 p.m.
I want you to, for a moment, think about playing a game of Monopoly, except in this game, that combination of skill, talent and luck that help earn you success in games, as in life, has been rendered irrelevant, because this game's been rigged, and you've got the upper hand.
You're going to have to pardon the sound quality, in some cases, because again, these were hidden cameras.
The rich player started to move around the board louder, literally smacking the board with their piece as he went around.
They wonder what that bowl of pretzels is doing there in the first place.
I'll buy it. I have so much money.
They have a lot less wealth and a lot less status and a lot less access to valued resources.
They'll never meet that stranger and the stranger will never meet them.
They're in studies. This is for them.
In typical California fashion, it's overtaken by the bus who almost runs our pedestrian over.
And that's understandable because the American dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper, as long as we apply ourselves and work hard, and a piece of that means that sometimes, you need to put your own interests above the interests and well-being of other people around you.
And if it's the case, as we've been finding, that the wealthier you are, the more entitled you feel to that wealth, and the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests above the interests of other people, and be willing to do things to serve that self-interest, well then there's no reason to think that those patterns will change.
This cascade of self-perpetuating, pernicious, negative effects could seem like something that's spun out of control, and there's nothing we can do about it, certainly nothing we as individuals could do.
Thank you.
The thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about -- and that's exactly what is happening -- is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions, for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected, in service of the long term.
This is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time.
Watch, this spring, for Paul Hawken's new book -- Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about.
Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.
It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer.
It's not about foundations necessarily; it's about the rest of us.
It lists already 1,000 entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise.
And everywhere I go, including here at TED, I feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing.
And as we've heard here, it is no exaggeration to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before.
This is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great-grandfather.
And I want you to imagine that it's 100 years from now, and your grandchild, or great-grandchild, or niece or nephew or god-child, is looking at this photograph of you.
And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.
Academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists, but fundamentally people chat with two, three, four -- anyway, less than five.
And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning.
But once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table, pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it.
And this is exactly what we've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table, and texting under the table to their friends.
Maybe you had a direct line.
And then the school enacts perfectly well.
They were living on top of the workshops where they were working.
I really think that the number is conservative.
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook.
Now, in those situations, wouldn't it be great if there was a button on your dashboard that you could push, and the car would get you home safely?
Now, if you're like me, and the other 70 percent of the population who know that we are above-average drivers, you understand that's a very high bar.
It's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition.
Now, we can take a map of a race track, we can take a mathematical model of a car, and with some iteration, we can actually find the fastest way around that track.
We decided to instrument not only the car, but also the race car driver, to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this.
Now, we can measure this, and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves.
So, here you see John on the track, he's going up the hill -- Oh! Somebody liked that -- and you can see, actually, his mental workload -- measuring here in the red bar -- you can see his actions as he approaches.
He's going to have to correct for that with steering.
And their actions are fantastic.
Can, in fact, the technology not simply replace humans, but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition that we're all capable of?
We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.
So these young men and women learned job-readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process.
Because, come to think about it, do you really want air-conditioning, or is it a cooler room that you want?
But the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.
Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs, or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills, and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region's wind.
I mean, they are not -- they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that.
But rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something, she's leaving behind a business plan to make it happen.
In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens, and they include generationally impoverished, traumatized vets returning from the Middle East, people coming out of jail.
And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models -- there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park, where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another, or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell.
And so we know "urban ag" is a big buzz topic this time of the year, but it's mostly gardening, which has some value in community building -- lots of it -- but it's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production.
Our municipalities, rural and urban, play the operational course of infrastructure -- things like waste disposal, energy demand, as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs.
It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.
Tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings, wealth generation and national security.
But, like all of us, he had some problems.
And I'm a grown woman now, and I have learned a few things along the way.
And I tell you, being on the TED stage and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that I had arrived.
And we love this, because I love construction now, because we're watching these things actually happen.
Most people don't know that when I went to high school in this country -- I applied for university at a time when I was convinced I was going to be an artist and be a sculptor.
I went and told my headmaster that, at prep school.
Something that would be important, but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had."
If you look at the picture, you'll see they're stacked up.
But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here.
It's really important. Using applications is OK, but programming is absolutely fundamental.
And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold.
It allows you to team up with people. The U.N.'s not going to be our partner if we're profit making. So announcing this with Kofi Annan was very important, and the U.N. allowed us to basically reach all the countries. And this was the machine we were showing before I met Yves Behar.
And then, I could tell you lots about the laptop, but I decided on just four things.
And by the way, when I graduated from MIT, I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years.
It wasn't just to kind of make it cute, because somebody -- you know, good design is very important.
And that's very important, the user interface.
So we went to Ethiopia, and we helped them make a keyboard.
In each case, got the ministers, went through a lot of the stuff.
And guess what? We won it hands down.
Launched it on the 12 of November.
Use your mailing lists. People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists.
The first kids got their laptops. They got them by ship, and I'm talking now about 7,000, 8,000 at a time went out this week.
I, like many of you, am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities.
And you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants' root systems.
The first few systems that we created, they kind of worked.
But what we call it is R&amp;D-I-Y, or research and develop it yourself.
So for do-it-yourselfers, we provide free, very well-tested instructions so that anyone, anywhere around the world, can build one of these systems for free.
Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own.
Are they going to be around in 50 years?
On the right there is another robot doll, who you could get a couple of years ago.
Another one from Karcher.
See, the three-year-old kids, they don't worry about it.
Here's another robot, the PackBot, that we've been building for a bunch of years.
And the big breakthrough for these robots, really, was September 11th.
So, this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously.
And over the next couple of months, we're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground.
Now notice, he nodded there, he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication.
Now see if you can put it back together.
The most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system.
And over here on the right, this is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module.
It sees her, pays attention to her.
You're such a cute little robot.
Voice: Kismet, do you like the toy? Oh.
So we put this in the robot.
Robot: Oh, cool.
But then the big questions, two big questions that people ask me are: if we make these robots more and more human-like, will we accept them, will we -- will they need rights eventually?
It's all mechanistic. We are mechanism.
And the second question is, will the machines want to take over?
We'll -- you know, they're not going to have a super bad robot.
And it made me think. I love studying these moments in American history when there was this frenzy of partisan anger, that the economy was on the verge of total collapse.
And this is what the inevitable problem looks like.
And as you can see, for most of recent history, except for a brief period, we have consistently spent more than we take in. Thus the national debt.
And behind this powerful disagreement between how to close that gap, there's the worst kind of cynical party politics, the worst kind of insider baseball, lobbying, all of that stuff, but there's also this powerfully interesting, respectful disagreement between two fundamentally different economic philosophies.
That's not going to create an equitable, fair society.
So when we're talking about cutting government spending, this is the pie we're talking about, and Americans overwhelmingly, and it doesn't matter what party they're in, overwhelmingly like that big 55 percent chunk.
People generally are comfortable with it, Democrats and Republicans.
That's 20 percent of the budget, and that presents a more difficult issue.
But that is not the case at all.
I talk to a lot of economists, and back in the '70s and '80s it was ugly being an economist.
The 20th century, the last hundred years, is riddled with disastrous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful, awful job, so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty.
If you ask people vague questions, like, "Do you think there should be more government or less government?"
They don't represent what our views are.
Throughout it all, the dollar has been one of the most long-standing, stable, reasonable currencies, and we all use it every single day, no matter what the people screaming about tell us, no matter how scared we're supposed to be.
When I was little -- and by the way, I was little once -- my father told me a story about an 18th century watchmaker.
But I felt something.
Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off, click click, when you closed the door in a car?
And the first was, I'd ask other people: "Do you like it?" "Yes."
And would you do me a favor?
I don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex.
They arrive first.
Would you mind taking the brain out, and I just want you to feel something.
Look at that picture.
I watch what people do.
There's something else in that.
And also triumph, this sense of transcendence, this "I never knew that. Ah, this is something new."
Or the information's added on at the back, like that little girl's drawing that I showed you.
And as a designer, I can't help meddling with this, so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this, and tried to understand what the individual elements were, but feeling it as I go.
Ahhhh.
And I feel that here.
I'm really getting into this now.
Massimo Tamburini.
No one's noticed, have they yet?
It's that easy to lose beauty, because beauty's incredibly difficult to do.
It's stupefyingly difficult to make something that refracts light like that, that comes out of the tool correctly, that goes down the line without falling over.
Anybody seen a ballet dancer's toes when they come out of the points?
It's not.
We are slaves to the first few fractions of a second -- and that's where much of my work has to win or lose, on a shelf in a shop.
No time. It says I have two minutes left, so we can't do this.
Form is function. Form is function.
One of the most common ways of dividing the world is into those who believe and those who don't -- into the religious and the atheists.
Well it starts from a very basic premise: of course, there's no God.
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament."
And for me, atheism 2.0 is about both, as I say, a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying, "What here could we use?"
You know the kind of thing a commencement address is, and graduation ceremonies, those lyrical claims that education, the process of education -- particularly higher education -- will make us into nobler and better human beings.
Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare, the dialogues of Plato, the novels of Jane Austen.
They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.
But anyway, we're only just holding it together.
I'm an independent, individual person."
So get on your knees and repeat it."
We're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they're so true.
Now we don't think that way.
We should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't.
What you're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it.
The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains, we are also bodies.
We don't tend to do that.
And the reason we've let ourselves down is that we're not properly studying how religions handle art.
Art is about two things in all the major faiths.
We think of Hitler, we think of Stalin. Don't, necessarily.
Art should be didactic.
What do organized religions do?
And corporations are very like religions in many ways, except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs.
They are multinational, as I say, they are branded, they have a clear identity, so they don't get lost in a busy world.
And if you're an educator in any way, again, look at how religions are spreading ideas.
But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from, which is this sense -- that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious -- of spiritual experience, of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are.
How many people here would say that religion is important to them?
It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community who are atheists.
And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored.
So it's a wiki project.
That feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career -- from being a software engineer to become a science writer -- so that I could partake in the joy of science, and also the joy of communicating it to others.
And most of the experiments, telescopes that I went to see are in some way addressing this question, these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy.
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world.
Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard.
The reason why they have to work in winter is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring, which, if they did that, they would need ships and submersibles to do their work.
And just to give you an idea, they have spent 20 million over 20 years.
But nonetheless, it's an extraordinary piece of engineering.
The reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the Atacama Desert is because of the high altitude desert.
That's an American C-17 cargo plane that flew us from New Zealand to McMurdo in Antarctica.
This is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer, and about 200 in winter when it's completely dark for six months.
And that process takes about two hours.
Here, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing, so they have to take their shoes off, get barefoot into the boxes, in this cold, and do that kind of work.
Anil Ananthaswamy: And I'll finally like to leave you with two images.
And it was very obvious that, if we destroy these silent places on Earth, we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards, because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space.
Carved above their door is, "Free to All."
And I'm going to try to argue only one point today: that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp.
Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.
Do you actually want it online?
But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.
You can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this.
So the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro, but I think it still has its place.
There are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well.
And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it, and it turns out that 200 dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good.
So we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India.
How do we go and do this, and how do we get it down so that it's a cost point that we could afford?
This is not a fax, this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job as you're going through these libraries.
The Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing -- 26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars, right?
Now we're scanning about 15,000 books a month, and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.
We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online.
Well, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks having been published -- so 78s, long-playing records and CDs -- or at least that's the largest archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at.
So we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free, to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library.
As best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many.
Television comes quite a bit larger.
So anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp.
We take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months.
So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria.
What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward?
It's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball.
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.
Peace, health, serenity, happiness, nirvana.
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty.
We all know the Earth is in trouble.
We have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer of nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium -- so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs.
Day 21, day 23, day 25.
They give rise to the trees, they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium.
It inhales oxygen, just like we do.
And if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly, because of the nodes of crossing -- Internet engineers maybe call them hot points -- there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.
Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land.
This is a photograph by Franz Hueber.
And these existed for tens of millions of years.
The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick.
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.
Birds then came, bringing in seeds, and our pile became an oasis of life.
There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram, and 10 to the third power is around 1,000.
May not seem that large -- let's get closer.
Dr. Earl Kern, who's a smallpox expert of the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active.
And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical.
These are spores -- this is in their spores.
So, the house is no longer suitable for invasion.
This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.
I took several containers -- my wife said, if I could do this, anybody could -- and I ended up growing a seed garden.
And we came up with Econol.
Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1.
So Biosphere 2 was essentially a three-acre, entirely sealed, miniature world that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes.
Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one.
Can you take this biosphere, that has evolved on a planetary scale, and jam it into a little bottle, and will it survive?
And this is the world that we lived in.
When I breathed out, my CO2 fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing.
Good lord -- we know that term now.
And we had no clue where it was.
We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine."
But on the other hand, it was the scientific gold of the project, because we could really crank this baby up, as a scientific tool, and see if we could, in fact, find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone.
And nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that.
People stink!
People must have thought I was nuts.
And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing: an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars.
In this case it was oilseed.
They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people.
And put your project in that context.
They go, "But how can I possibly find my way in that?
We're very uncomfortable with untidiness.
And all of Tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake.
Take a breath now.
So the natural question you ask then at that point is, how do I get good at what I'm trying to do?
The cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us.
What they were trying to do was figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses for which they could do something.
You set the fracture, you drew the blood, you spun the blood, looked at it under the microscope, you plated the culture, you injected the antiserum.
But what does it take?
By the end of the 20th century, it had become more than 15 clinicians for the same typical hospital patient -- specialists, physical therapists, the nurses.
Our experience as people who get sick, need help from other people, is that we have amazing clinicians that we can turn to -- hardworking, incredibly well-trained and very smart -- that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope, but little sense that it consistently all comes together for you from start to finish in a successful way.
And vice versa, the best care often turns out to be the least expensive -- has fewer complications, the people get more efficient at what they do.
There's a famous thought experiment that touches exactly on this that said, what if you built a car from the very best car parts?
You have to become really interested in data, unsexy as that sounds.
They had found a problem.
And so we looked at what other high-risk industries do.
You need to identify the moments in a process when you can actually catch a problem before it's a danger and do something about it.
And we had items like making sure everyone in the room had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day, because you get half a dozen people or more who are sometimes coming together as a team for the very first time that day that you're coming in.
There's a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we're not a system, forces us to behave with a different set of values.
And it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves.
Now, that's an awful lot of bees.
And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu.
And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health.
And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out.
They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world.
And he has a history of these trucks, and he's moved these bees up and down the coast.
And if you look at Florida, in Dade City, Florida, that's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go.
Of course, the real importance for bees is not the honey.
And there are flowers that are self-infertile. That means they can't -- the pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves.
In Pennsylvania alone, we have been surveying bees for 150 years, and very intensely in the last three years.
Dennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks.
And I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man, because there's no money to research the bat problems.
And that is, make meadows and not lawns.
In fact, you know, the White House used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in World War I, which probably is not a bad idea; it wouldn't be a bad idea.
Now, not all of us have meadows, or lawns that we can convert, and so you can always, of course, grow a meadow in a pot.
And I hope that you experience it and I hope you tell me about it one day.
So I whistled along with him.
But during a Christmas party -- at dinner actually -- it's very annoying.
She didn't expect me to go there.
That was great fun, of course.
You say, "Huh, what do you mean?"
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling.
Oh, hah.
Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you.
So now we have God that is going to submerge Earth permanently or at least for a very long period, and no one is taking care of plants.
We have the animals that are able to live and to sense, and on the top of the pyramid, there is the man.
And they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence.
And this is a living organism that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons.
No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal, because it was against the order of nature.
They are training themselves, as many young animals do, to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day.
Plants are even able to communicate -- they are extraordinary communicators.
But some plants are manipulating animals, like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen.
This is not a metaphor.
Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature, but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye.
They work in the same way.
But why have we not any plantoid?
And these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids, driven by algae or by the leaves at the end, by the most, most powerful parts of the plants, by the roots.
She doesn't know she's being filmed.
And as you'll see now, I'm not wearing pants.
So at this point, she decides to put the rape book away.
This goes on for another four stops.
It's a prank, but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell.
And it was very peculiar, because it was dark out, but she was back-lit with florescent lighting, and she was very much onstage, and I couldn't figure out why she was doing it.
The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out "Look Up More," the name of the project.
And because it was in Union Square Park, right by a subway station, there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing.
This is the Best Buy in New York City.
Everybody else is one of our actors.
And you can see the cops in this footage right here.
I think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason.
And they're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs.
And I've never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game, saying, "All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands."
It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.
Right now, if you want to test water in the field, you need a trained technician, expensive equipment like this, and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results.
It's a fast, cheap device that answers an important question: Is this water contaminated?
And then, instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most, it can happen automatically.
No, no.
This is the ancestor of cattle.
They're just as natural as cows.
I want to say, no, religions are an important natural phenomenon.
Here's my proposal.
Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship.
You can't own your children.
No values, just facts about all the world's religions.
That's the steward.
They could outsource all their problems -- protection from predators, food finding, health maintenance.
Whose clever move was it?
But the process itself is without purpose, without foresight, without design.
The lesson we learn from this is you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary.
That was just 10,000 years ago.
"Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life: complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile.
They would be puzzled by many things.
The ant isn't alone.
It means "surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah."
"The heart of worship is surrender.
And you heard just now what the goal is.
30 million copies of this book.
Excellent insights into human psychology, wise advice on every page.
With me, everybody -- every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
My problem is, some of the bits in it I don't think are true.
Yes, there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong.
And here I think, "Wait a minute."
Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way.
"Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge, hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being, an inbuilt need to connect with God."
And that's a problem.
Don't listen, don't listen!
And here's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions.
So, I wish we could drop this meme.
Your ears can't hear that chord; they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear 10 octaves.
For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions, places you can listen from?
It's got no destination in mind -- it's just enjoying the journey.
Now, when you were little, if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it, you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum.
We squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this.
Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another, but really worryingly, 16 percent -- roughly one in six -- of American teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse.
Protect your ears in that way.
If you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you.
And music, of course. Just listening to music is good for you, if it's music that's made with good intention, made with love, generally.
Musicians have bigger brains -- it's true.
So I urge you to take that path.
And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent.
We can see them indirectly, because black holes wreak havoc on their environment.
Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space.
And he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary: curves so strong that space would rain down into them, space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole.
He did not believe they existed in nature.
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.
If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience.
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe.
You would literally hear the sound.
We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.
Want to get away from the sound.
And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core.
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.
We weren't even here.
But it's around us everywhere, presumably, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe.
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us?
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.
And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees, to consider other entities that are also static and stuck, but which cry for change and dynamicism, and one of those entities is our prisons.
Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists, sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons.
They're kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day.
The story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist, as an Iranian woman artist, as an Iranian woman artist living in exile.
Also, people like myself, we're fighting two battles on different grounds.
We are there to inspire, to provoke, to mobilize, to bring hope to our people.
My journey as an artist started from a very, very personal place.
So in a way, by studying a woman, you can read the structure and the ideology of the country.
I am a nomadic artist.
This book is banned, and she spent five years in prison.
And we made this film in Casablanca, recreating all the shots.
The green movement significantly inspired the world.
They have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way.
It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.
As the child grows to become an adult: so far, it has been a consumer, but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute, to be a contributor.
You can be compassionate occasionally, more moved by empathy than by compassion.
The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground, throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.
And that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people, you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life -- even words, even time.
You can't say, "Please love me."
All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself.
Maybe the swami is right.
You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless, either you are or you are not. Period.
To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.
My predecessor meant that.
You fake it and make it.
Salman Khan: So the hypotenuse is now going to be five.
If this does not blow your mind, then you have no emotion.
They told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person.
And that's what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before, and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room.
I actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day.
We could not believe it.
The other thing that happened -- and even at this point, I said, "Okay, maybe it's a good supplement.
They can pause, repeat at their own pace, at their own time.
This is a more competent version of it.
Maybe they didn't know what happens when you raise something to the zero power.
So our model is learn math the way you'd learn anything, like the way you would learn a bicycle.
And they all fit together.
Further down, you start getting into algebra one, algebra two, a little bit of precalculus.
And I want to make it clear, we don't view this as the complete math education.
And what the teacher does is literally just say, "Let me intervene on the red kids."
Red is wrong, blue is right.
And in a traditional model, if you did a snapshot assessment, you say, "These are the gifted kids, these are the slow kids.
A lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student-to-teacher ratios.
Now imagine what happens where -- we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom.
SK: Oh yeah. No, we have an awesome team working on it.
Someone from their board came and said, "What would you do if you had carte blanche in a classroom?"
It's not an only-in-school thing.
And they're literally saying, "Hey, this is nice, but ... " Like that focus graph, a lot of the teachers said, "I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic."
And the vision of the tutoring thing.
We see with the eyes, but we see with the brain as well.
They told me that one of their residents, an old lady in her 90s, was seeing things, and they wondered if she'd gone bonkers or, because she was an old lady, whether she'd had a stroke, or whether she had Alzheimer's.
But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth.
They wear bright colors, rose and blue, like Eastern dress."
She knew it was a hallucination.
She was a bright old lady, perfectly sane. She had no medical problems.
And she was very relieved at this, that there was nothing seriously the matter, and also rather curious.
About 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations.
The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair.
It's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash.
With him and with Rosalie, what seems to be going on -- and Rosalie said, "What's going on?" -- and I said that as you lose vision, as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input, they become hyperactive and excitable, and they start to fire spontaneously.
A lot of them had to do with a car.
Now, I don't watch Sesame Street, but she made a point of saying, "Why Kermit?" She said, "Kermit the Frog means nothing to me.
Something like 10 percent, as I said, of visually impaired people get these.
There is a film. You're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you, or that's how people think about it.
So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations, you have all sorts of levels, from the geometrical hallucinations -- the pink and blue squares the woman had -- up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces.
When images are formed, a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe.
Around 1970, it was found that there were not only parts of the brain, but particular cells.
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome, you don't go to those higher levels.
But in fact people say, "I don't recognize the people. I can't form any associations."
Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago -- he wondered how, thinking these hallucinations, how, as he put it, the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain.
I'm blind in one eye, and not terribly good in the other.
That was an utterly, utterly fascinating talk.
But mostly I'm entranced by it.
This is the first time it has ever been recorded.
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate, a single-celled alga.
So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime, because the top speed of this fish is one knot, which was the top speed of the submersible.
There's other ways you can defend yourself with light.
They use it for finding food, for attracting mates, for defending against predators.
And you see things like this.
This looks like a plant, but it's actually an animal.
And like the one you just saw, it can produce these as bands of light.
And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals, so it's unobtrusive.
We're talking to something.
And then finally, I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep-sea webcam, which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year.
Okay, so this next one is from the webcam, and it's going to be this pinwheel display.
There's supposed to be something else there."
This is something that should be on everybody's bucket list, because we live on an ocean planet.
They're smaller than a wavelength of light, so we have no way to directly observe them.
And he transformed our understanding of the Moon.
In the top left-hand corner, you've got this yellow-green area.
This is DNA in its classic double helix form.
So DNA's entering the production line from the left-hand side, and it hits this collection, these miniature biochemical machines, that are pulling apart the DNA strand and making an exact copy.
Thank you.
This huge package of DNA is called a chromosome.
These sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes, and we'll focus on them.
And if we isolate just one chromosome, we're going to pull it out and have a look at its structure.
It is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes.
It's able to feel when the cell is ready, when the chromosome is correctly positioned.
They're little molecular courier molecules walking one way.
What I'm going to do is to just give a few notes, and this is from a book I'm preparing called "Letters to a Young Scientist."
Technology is increasing at a comparable rate.
Keep your eyes lifted and your head turning.
If you are a bit short in mathematical skills, don't worry.
I speak as an authority on that subject, because I'm an extreme case.
They are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work, during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant.
In selecting a subject in which to conduct original research, or to develop world-class expertise, take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited.
So Wilson's Principle Number Three: March away from the sound of the guns.
Well, if that's the case, good. Why hard instead of easy?
The second strategy of research is to study a subject broadly searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena like a hunter in what we call "the naturalist's trance," the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting, any quarry worth taking.
And I thank you for having me here tonight.
I started thinking about the relationship between communication, media and collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs," and I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it.
Did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families?
We saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant Reformation, constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before.
And there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas.
Twenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question: if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors, how does cooperation exist at all?
Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness, that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions, whether we know that or not.
And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be.
Which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together.
Now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism; they're doing it because they're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest.
BitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader, making the system more efficient the more it is used.
A transdisciplinary study of cooperation?
Thank you.
If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched.
And so, when you fly down -- Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, is a function of all of that geometry, all of that 3D understanding behind this model.
But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment.
All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play.
OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner.
I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside.
This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time. If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date.
At the same time, if you think about it, there's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us.
And if you think about mountain climbing as an example, it suggests all kinds of things.
This was in preparation for a merger and acquisition.
And to start with, we created a little experiment in which we gave people Legos, and we asked them to build with Legos.
After they finished every one of them, we put them under the table.
There's something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating.
Now what happens when you compare these two conditions?
In this other version of the experiment, we didn't put people in this situation, we just described to them the situation, much as I am describing to you now, and we asked them to predict what the result would be.
And that's actually what we found in the meaningful condition.
And they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company.
And they didn't really raise their hands, but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports.
And he would tell them, "At the moment I directed you in this way, and now that I am directing you in this way, everything will be okay."
The experimenter would look at it, scan it from top to bottom, say "uh huh" and put it on the pile next to them.
At 15 cents per page, they basically stopped these efforts.
Would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder, or somewhere in the middle?
The next part I want to show you is something about the positive motivation.
So when they started cake mixes in the '40s, they would take this powder and they would put it in a box, and they would ask housewives to basically pour it in, stir some water in it, mix it, put it in the oven, and -- voila! -- you had cake.
It was as if you bought it in the store.
We asked people to build some origami.
And what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami, and they were willing to pay for them five times more than the people who just evaluated them externally.
For some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions.
And evaluators? They loved it even less.
And you played with them for a few hours.
Let me say one last comment.
And I think that in the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx, but the reality is that we've switched and now we're in the knowledge economy.
But today I've got a personal story to share with you.
The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world.
I mean, from 1965 to 1973 there were more munitions that fell on Cambodia than in all of World War II Japan, including the two nuclear bombs of August 1945.
And in fact they were forced to work the fields.
And it made it possible, in fact, for us to take on this plan.
And then onwards to Chau Doc.
And she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom, but also fear, because we had just come out of Cambodia.
You may know this from the media, but what you may not know is that the average age of the Afghan people is 17 years old, which means they grow up in such an environment and -- I repeat myself -- in 30 years of war.
And donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads.
No one can survive alone.
So everybody needs a sense for the future, and the Afghan sense of the future is shattered.
And I want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children, and I will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter," -- what happens too often in Afghanistan.
This was our sign -- it's hand-painted, and we had 45 all over Kabul.
This means, certainly, to retrain all health staff.
So this makes us very happy, because now we also have some evidence that this is working.
And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation.
Shouldn't we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels?"
Transport, we don't need oil anymore."
And let's imagine the cars are spaced 80 meters apart from each other, and they're just perpetually going along this road.
So let's start in the United Kingdom, since that's where we are today.
I should emphasize, both of these axes are logarithmic. As you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar you're going up a factor of 10.
Here's another message from this diagram.
The United Kingdom is consuming 1.25 watts per square meter.
Wind power produces a bit more, 2.5 watts per square meter, but that's only twice as big as 1.25 watts per square meter, so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind farms, you need wind farms half the area of the U.K.
And I'm not saying that's a bad idea.
All renewables, much as I love them, are diffuse.
Here's a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing in the little town of Penicuik just outside Edinburgh, and you can see the children of Penicuik celebrating the burning of the effigy of the windmill.
In addition to the supply levers that we can push, and remember, we need large amounts, because at the moment, we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels.
And there are other options in between, because maybe the lady in the tank would say, "No, no, no, that's a lifestyle change. Don't change my lifestyle, please."
Well, the laws of physics are written up there, which describe what -- how the power consumption for heating is driven by the things you can control.
And people talk a lot about smart meters, but you can do it yourself.
So, if you wanted to get 16 light bulbs, remember, today our total energy consumption is 125 light bulbs' worth.
Let's now see the extraordinary speech that we captured a couple weeks ago.
When I arrived at the rehearsal, only 11 kids had shown up, and I said to myself, "Do I close the program or multiply these kids?"
In its essence, the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures.
He is a boy from a parish in Caracas who passionately attended to his double bass lessons at the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra.
It's a program of social rescue and deep cultural transformation designed for the whole Venezuelan society with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever, but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups.
Within the family, the parents' support is unconditional.
It's what makes a child play a violin at home, while his father works in his carpentry.
I believe that to confront such a crisis, only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity, to mankind's deepest aspirations, and to the historic demands of our times.
In this rather long sort of marathon presentation, I've tried to break it up into three parts: the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer and really address the qualities of the human interface.
Where you are now, all of a sudden, sitting in front of personal computers and video text -- teletext systems, and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen?
High-tech, high-touch. Isn't that what some of you said?
And then when you finally see where it is, then you've got to move it to get the cursor over there, and then -- "Bang" -- you've got to hit a button or do whatever.
maybe a mouse is a new kind of bug.
The person's just, if you will, pushing on the screen to make a curve.
So again, they don't have to be weight; they could be a general trying to move troops, and he's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat.
And you then say, "There's an opportunity for making conversational movies." Well, what does that mean?
And I think I use the example all too often, but it's a great one because there is a classic ending in that little encyclopedia-style cookbook that tells you how to do something like penguin, and you get to the end of the recipe and it says, "Cook until done."
So, what I will show you is ... it's a rather boring book, but I'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books because your sponsors aren't necessarily interested in fiction and entertainment. And this is a book on how to repair a transmission.
I can get a definition of these words just by touching them, and the definition will appear in the illustration corner.
NN: I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language.
They were delighted, and by the time it was time to go see the principal, whom they'd actually come to see -- not the computer room -- they went upstairs and they said, "This is absolutely remarkable!
It's absolutely irrelevant, and I get nothing for it.
What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child; the child can get a great deal by talking to you.
This student was one of our first students, and it's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard, and she came ... within two days -- I want to show you the program she wrote, and remember her hairstyle. And that is the program she made.
And the fact that we knew the people -- we had to take a page out of the history of Walt Disney -- we actually went so far as to build CRTs in the shapes of the people's faces.
And I'll show you one more slide, where this is actually made from something called a solid photograph and is the screen.
And they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly, that sits on their kitchen table and says, "I'm old. I'm frail."
Oh, hey."
So, sensors are looking at that kind of voice.
And it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on for the last 10 years at Intel.
We go live with them in the winter because what they do in the winter, and their access to healthcare, and how much they socialize, is very different than in the summer.
And that switchover, when we had the larger number of older people on the planet, for the first time than younger people.
And in fact, it's upon us.
So, one of the reasons it's so challenging to prepare for this Y2K problem is, I want to argue, we have what I would call mainframe poisoning.
And it's a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divided the body, and divided care into departments and compartments.
When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say, "Quick response: healthcare."
It's population-based.
How do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you?
Many people in this generation won't press the button, even if they have an alert call system, because they don't want to bother anybody, even though they've been paying 30 dollars a month.
I can't stop this from happening.
That's sort of the state of the art.
These are two different subjects in our study.
The problem is, Intel is still one of the largest funders in the world of independent living technology research.
No matter who pays for it, we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams and using disruptive technologies that are already here to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways.
So, I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward.
This is what someone that specializes in malware and hacking looks like.
People normally write that down, by the way.
Well you, my friend, you've came to the right place.
For a small fee, they can upload it and make sure everything is good.
Now, there are many ways you can get infected.
Awww.
So this is writing out the malicious code, and a few seconds later, on the left-hand side, you'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text.
It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.
That website address at the top there, which you can just about see, microshaft.com, the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs, and up pops fake antivirus.
Chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day is a massive challenge, and those numbers are only growing directly in proportion to the length of my stress line, you'll note here.
That's a username, kind of like you might have on Twitter.
We used Google.
It turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation.
That's right, cybercriminals do have Christmas parties, as it turns out.
I was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals, who wouldn't be so concerned by law, and here you can see my mobile device.
So let's make this a little bit more interesting.
And I should mention as well that some of you do use your names, "James Lyne's iPhone," for example.
We also need to think about the legal issues in this area.
Make sure you use a different password on each of your sites and services online.
I was fortunate in finding things.
And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles that people had thought for so many years.
The adults can recognize the juveniles; the juveniles can recognize the adults.
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."
And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around.
And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone.
So a few years went by, and then we started the Hell Creek Project.
But this one died at the age of 16.
There were flexible, clear blood vessels.
The cells looked better.
Birds are living dinosaurs.
"The chicken is not."
Because evolution works, we actually have some evolutionary tools.
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.
There's what we call atavism activation.
We can save that one.
And I said, "Well, if you can find those, I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."
And so what we're looking for is that gene.
It's a cooler-looking chicken.
Anyway -- When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design.
But I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption, and that I was only scratching the surface, and that right the way up the food supply chain, in supermarkets, greengrocers, bakers, in our homes, in factories and farms, we were hemorrhaging out food.
Unfortunately, empirical data, good, hard stats, don't exist, and therefore to prove my point, I first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted.
But the thing that really struck me, when I plotted all this data, and it was a lot of numbers, was that you can see how it levels off.
In many ways, this is a great success story of human civilization, of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago.
That's a problem primarily associated with developing work agriculture, whether it's a lack of infrastructure, refrigeration, pasteurization, grain stores, even basic fruit crates, which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields.
This is the result of my hobby, which is unofficial bin inspections.
So I kept on thinking, where do those crusts go?
If we do that to fruit and vegetables, you bet we can do it to animals too.
How have I insulted my host?"
Most people. The one on the left was kept in a fridge for 10 days.
If you cook food for pigs, just as if you cook food for humans, it is rendered safe.
We fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted.
And when you use these things you don't have to go like that.
And maps are important devices for transferring information, especially if you have human cognitive ability.
I'll meet you at Frigoris. No. I don't think so.
"Oh look! Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy!
And that's the Tonga underworld.
Yeah, I'm at the Depressio, and I want to get over to Amazonis so I plug it into the Mars map, and click the button and there's my directions.
This is from their rule book, the International Astronomical Union.
"Now, Frank is this clear to you, Djabran Fluctus?"
I did some more investigation.
There are some mapping people who do use their names.
That seems a little silly to me.
So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet, and the day Saturday, named after it, wonderfully.
The dodecahedron, it's dual.
So, the whole concept of branes in the universe, if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be.
So, I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger.
So, maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge.
I don't get that at all.
It's a different kind of course. And they've got five apples?
Once again, that's Sierra Leone.
But I'd say he'd been to Hellespointica Depressio recently.
That's Jude Law and some of his films recently didn't work.
"Ten milligram, 20 milligram."
So, then I thought a calculator is a metaphor.
Every top adds up to 37.
This is beyond anything anybody could just make up.
And I'm presenting it here at TED. Why?
Am I the only one that sees this?
They start looking like planets.
Hey, you can't make this up.
There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then.
That attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days, and in fact, it wasn't just the people on the network, but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the Internet itself.
But, of course, you couldn't do it, because we don't know the names of all the people with Internet or email addresses, and even if we did know their names, I'm pretty sure that they would not want their name, address and telephone number published to everyone.
And so, there are many of those things that start to happen.
Nobody has claimed credit for that.
And the way the Internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places, and this one processor, because of a broken card, decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time.
When you pump gas, you really don't think you're using the Internet.
And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet and saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that, you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather, or something like that.
There's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept to be independent of the Internet, made out of completely different sets of building blocks.
It could definitely be done by people in this room.
However, this episode reveals the growing anxiety in the Western world regarding these emerging cyber weapons.
As a result, the Americans take the threat very seriously.
However, if we'd had this talk 60 years ago, we would have seen how the emergence of new aircraft and tank technologies, which give the advantage to the attacker, make the Blitzkrieg doctrine very credible and thus create the possibility of war in Europe.
Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature: they can be used without leaving traces.
On the other hand, we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking.
So nations may live under the threat of what Nobel Prize winner Thomas Schelling called the "reciprocal fear of surprise attack," as I don't know if my neighbor is about to attack me or not -- I may never know -- so I might take the upper hand and attack first.
I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words.
But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently, and it's become the foundation of my work because, I feel like, if in a day, I can see the ocean differently, then I can evoke that same kind of change in others, especially kids.
But that day I flew low over the islands -- it was a family trip to the Caribbean, and I flew in a small plane low over the islands.
These were the ones I'd like to draw -- all variations of four legs and fur.
It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that.
Maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here -- give him a headlight, maybe a brake light, turn signals.
It's not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all.
And then I'm going to attempt onscreen animation here.
It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page, right?
And he does manage to find them, but great navigation skills, lousy pick-up lines.
I've taken them to the Sea of Japan, where they met giant jellyfish.
I was speaking to a lot of my friends in the conservation business, and they -- I asked them, "So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about?"
What I'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn't really go away; it just continues to wash downstream.
Now, finning is the act of taking a shark, cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water.
So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one.
There was a real website based in China that actually sold shark fins, so I kind of exposed that.
You've been given one tool, a hammer.
And you hear other people doing the same thing.
And that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way.
It's such a beautiful place. It's the most stunningly wild place I've ever been.
There was no one to relate publicly to.
On Todagin Mountain, revered by the Tahltan people as a wildlife sanctuary in the sky, home to the largest population of stone sheep on the planet, Imperial Metals -- but the 75th-biggest mining company in all of Canada -- has secured permits to establish an open-pit copper and gold mine which will process 30,000 tons of rock a day for 30 years, generating hundreds of millions of tons of toxic waste that, by the project's design, will simply be dumped into the lakes of the Sacred Headwaters.
The Tahltan have called for the creation of a tribal heritage reserve which will set aside the largest protected area in British Columbia.
By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator?
Would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number please?
OK, great.
What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you -- one, two, three, four -- to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second, the third and the fourth, I will try and race you to the answer. OK?
93 squared. Would you call out your answers, please?
I'm going to try to square some three-digit numbers this time.
Another, another three-digit -- -- another three-digit number, sir?
Audience: Oh, 722.
I'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time.
9,758, this will take me a little bit of time, so bear with me.
I can probably do it.
Seven? Seven?
Did you leave out the number 6?
OK, any six of them.
Let's see, starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first, OK sir, what year was it, first of all? That's why I start with a gentleman first.
Audience: 1949. 1949, and the month?
Sixth -- was that a Friday? Audience: Yes.
We can do it that way.
'66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966 -- and what month?
June what? Sixth.
OK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator.
Audience: Seven. Seven.
Now, let me recap.
If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then. All right -- by the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- OK, you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here.
That seems right, I'll go on. Cookie fission, OK.
First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.
The second time, it's engineering.
So don't go back and read my dissertation.
They know.
I'd love to talk about it, it'd be fun, but I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now?
It has zero volume. And it's non-orientable.
That was a month of my life.
And it sent me back.
Mentoring me. He'd come up and spend hours and hours with me.
Oh, cool. I can get to this place over here, right?
And I said, "Well, I've taught graduate -- I've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes."
Not just show up to class every now and then.
Oh, before I even turn that on, one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class -- this is through the lens, and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light.
But meanwhile, let's measure the speed of sound!
So, in order to measure the speed of sound, all I've got to do is know its frequency. Well, that's easy.
Those of you who are physicists, I hear you rolling your eyes, but bear with me.
Let's figure out what this is.
There's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off.
I go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall.
I go to a place where a dowel splits off.
Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said.
Whatever it is must be pretty important, because I've traveled with it, moved it, from apartment to apartment to apartment.
Lots of credit card debt, huge environmental footprints, and perhaps not coincidentally, our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years.
I wanted it all -- home office, sit down dinner for 10, room for guests, and all my kite surfing gear.
We've got to clear the arteries of our lives.
We want space efficiency.
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers.
Maybe a little more time?"
It's got to be serious if the New York Times puts a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play.
And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then.
And something very unusual happens.
They are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals.
And it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it.
We're going to look at body play, which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity.
The human hand, in manipulation of objects, is the hand in search of a brain; the brain is in search of a hand; and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way.
Now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration.
And rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us.
We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story.
I think that -- that's a few years back -- I think that wave is past, and the play wave is cresting, because there is some good science.
The animal world has objectified it.
And, and, and -- there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about.
Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago.
You know, you can tell -- and I think when we're getting into collective play, its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals.
Kevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances: alcoholic mother, absent father, inner-city Philadelphia, black, had to take care of a younger brother.
He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington, D.C.
We're about two and a half, three months into it, and it's really been fun.
Attendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the task that they left at their desk.
And I think you'll have a better and more empowered life.
And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically, animals sleep and dream, and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams.
So people know that it's there.
BR: And we're chefs. So when Moto opened in 2004, people didn't really know what to expect. A lot of people thought that it was a Japanese restaurant, and maybe it was the name, maybe it was the logo, which was like a Japanese character, but anyway, we had all these requests for Japanese food, which is really not what we did. And after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll, we decided to give the people what they wanted. So this picture is an example of printed food, and this was the first foray into what we like to call flavor transformation. So this is all the ingredients, all the flavor of, you know, a standard maki roll, printed onto a little piece of paper.
HC: Delicious.
So we put this in the basement, and we got really serious about food, like serious experimentation.
They're hard to just get automatically.
Let's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that.
But where is this going?
This disruptive mentality of what food is would essentially open up the encyclopedia of what raw ingredients are, even if we just swapped out, say, one of these for flour, that would eliminate so much energy and so much waste.
This map -- -- this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories, by country, in February of 2007 -- just one year ago.
This story eclipsed every country except Iraq, and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report.
The most popular news sites don't do much better.
And can we afford not to? Thank you.
So, from both directions, there is kind of, I think, a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day, or her own day, which I think artists are obliged to do, is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have.
How can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences, not necessarily utilitarian ones.
And their own personalities come out in totally unique ways.
So what we're really seeing here is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia, which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have.
And as you do, you see the shadows of your own speech.
And in this project we've developed a form of intelligent real-time subtitles.
You know? They don't imagine the person in the booth, typing it all.
And so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects.
Hello? And I can ... hello ... okay.
So I'll just add a couple more. Blink. Blink.
So it blinks one second after you do.
I'm at Carnegie Mellon; we've got a great Robotics Institute there.
It's got a computer vision system, and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most.
When most people think about the beginnings of AIDS, they're gonna think back to the 1980s.
And you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses from animals into human populations.
This was absolutely key for us. This is a very intimate form of connection.
We give them these little pieces of filter paper.
We stop for a drink of water.
NW: So this is from this animal right here, Greater Spot-Nosed Guenon.
They're going to say, in regions of profound instability throughout the world, where you have intense poverty, where populations are growing and you don't have sustainable resources like this, this is going to lead to food insecurity.
There's no easy solutions, but what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem at our own peril.
One of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field.
Often we run into obstacles. This is us coming back from one of these very rural sites, with specimens from 200 individuals that we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours.
Now we have our own liquid nitrogen.
And let's face it, any new retrovirus in the human population -- it's something we should be aware of.
It's also working in live animal markets -- these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where SARS emerged in Asia.
The dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about.
So I learned to follow hunches even though you can't necessarily justify them or know where they're going to go.
This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning, and what got us excited.
In fact, there are 47 members of Congress who currently have Twitter accounts.
Another is via the API.
We liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product.
I've learned to follow the hunch, but never assume where it will go.
"Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED."
You have build something very fascinating, and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it.
Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria.
Things changed when I discovered African books.
I come from a conventional, middle-class Nigerian family.
So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.
She asked where I had learned to speak English so well, and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language.
Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia.
Now, I've laughed every time I've read this.
Therefore they were not authentically African.
I realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind, the abject immigrant.
Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans, and not with the arrival of the British, and you have an entirely different story.
When I learned, some years ago, that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful, I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me.
But to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me.
So what if before my Mexican trip I had followed the immigration debate from both sides, the U.S. and the Mexican?
And she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel.
What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider, who has just started her own business selling hair extensions?
The American writer Alice Walker wrote this about her Southern relatives who had moved to the North.
We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives, and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions.
We've surrendered our power, trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide.
Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself, you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you?
And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift, that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks -- because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects, or studies funded by food companies of their new products, massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market.
But how can we do this?
What has your investigation focused on?
Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts, which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true.
Best Buy, the consumer electronics company, gets all its employees -- the cleaners, the shop assistants, the people in the back office, not just its forecasting team -- to place bets, yes bets, on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas, on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company, on whether a project will come in on time.
I'd like to talk about my dad.
Or, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia, and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us.
If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.
With my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms.
I am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box.
I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it, I'll still be able to be mobile.
And what I need now is to learn to be like that.
And I started playing with it more like a puzzle.
So one, it has to be more convenient than a car.
And not from the power of an edict down.
If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater, when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work.
You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine.
Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive.
But the crude oil is replaced with a battery.
And the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number.
And these prices are actually with clean electrons.
That's how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments.
He said hybrids are like mermaids.
We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark.
If your car is driving outside Israel it's been stolen.
He decided that he's going to take over the state, unofficially, and then officially, and then created this beautiful Region One policy.
And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground.
By 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we're going at right now.
And the downs are going to be much longer and the ups are going to be much shorter.
That is the most pessimistic number you can have.
China solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city, and that will be it.
No infrastructure, no problem.
In Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills, not from oil.
Think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years.
That's, in the additive, about 25 percent of our problem.
200 years ago, in Parliament, in Great Britain, there was a long argument over economy versus morality.
We have to make the right moral decision.
Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others -- the beauty of the things they showed.
Contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly new version of creationism, called "Intelligent Design," or ID.
This book, "Finding Darwin's God," by Kenneth Miller, is one of the most effective attacks on Intelligent Design that I know, and it's all the more effective because it's written by a devout Christian.
Now, it may sound as though I'm about to preach atheism, and I want to reassure you that that's not what I'm going to do.
This argument of course, shoots itself in the foot.
So, returning to tactics and the evolution lobby, I want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do.
Why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate to support the Republicans or Democrats, this model of economics versus that, Macintosh instead of Windows, but to have an opinion about how the universe began, about who created the universe -- no, that's holy.
And the first paper is a standard scientific paper presenting evidence, "Iridium Layer at the K-T Boundary, Potassium-Argon Dated Crater in Yucatan, Indicate That an Asteroid Killed the Dinosaurs."
Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous.
Incidentally, I'm not usually very proud of being British, but you can't help making the comparison.
The latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading.
Is there any correlation, positive or negative, between intelligence and tendency to be religious?
In 1998, Larson and Witham polled the cream of American scientists, those who'd been honored by election to the National Academy of Sciences, and among this select group, belief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent.
I'm not a citizen of this country, so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming if I suggest that something needs to be done.
There could be non-linearities, threshold effects.
What happened was that Aveling's mistress was Marx's daughter, and when both Darwin and Marx were dead, Marx's papers became muddled up with Aveling's papers and a letter from Darwin saying, "My dear sir, thank you very much but I don't want you to dedicate your book to me," was mistakenly supposed to be addressed to Marx, and that gave rise to this whole myth, which you've probably heard.
You think we might have grown up since then.
The onus is not on the rest of us to say why not.
Such people might be those belonging to the British lynch mob which last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile.
Now, I said that if I were religious, I'd be very afraid of evolution. I'd go further.
The religious lobby in this country is massively financed by foundations -- to say nothing of all the tax benefits -- by foundations such as the Templeton Foundation and the Discovery Institute.
And so, to start helping that, I want to take us back to 1835.
It's just been industrial, which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars, and later, more for the telegraph, and the radio transmitter, and the television, and eventually the mainframe.
What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution, the most important means, the most important components of the core economic activities -- remember, we are in an information economy -- of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else, are in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we've seen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population, and we've got human creativity, human wisdom, human experience -- the other major experience, the other major input -- which unlike simple labor -- stand here turning this lever all day long -- is not something that's the same or fungible among people.
Think of it in minivans. A group of automobile engineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota. Right?
The claim to fame of Yahoo! was, we hire people to look -- originally, not anymore -- we hire people to look at websites and tell you -- if they're in the index, they're good. This, on the other hand, is what 60,000 passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project, each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about, to say, this is good. So, this is the Open Directory Project, with 60,000 volunteers, each one spending a little bit of time, as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees. No one owns it, no one owns the output, it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social and psychological motivations to do something interesting.
If in 1999 I told you, let's build a data storage and retrieval system.
That was, in fact, economic.
If you leave a $50 check after dinner with friends, you don't increase the probability of being invited back.
Just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning, or, in places that are more involved, like Wikipedia, gives me a certain set of social relations.
And you see surfers, people who see this happening, and in some sense build it into a supply chain, which is a very curious one. Right?
So next time you open the paper, and you see an intellectual property decision, a telecoms decision, it's not about something small and technical.
While it is true that those things are going on, there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.
This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria -- led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.
And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.
That's the image: African countries. But let me say this: if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London -- if the other people who had taken money, estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this, what is that? Is that not corruption?
We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.
No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.
When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector, we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.
So privatization is one of the things we've done.
When they crashed, we crashed.
And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.
So, huge things in construction, real estate, mortgage markets. Financial services: we had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.
In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.
Conflicts are down on the continent; from about 12 conflicts a decade ago, we are down to three or four conflicts -- one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet, isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?
Mixing African materials, such as we have, with materials from elsewhere.
So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.
But what really threatens humanity?
In 1918, a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people.
But first, I have to explain why they're important because vaccines, the power of them, is really like a whisper.
Until recently, we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked.
Now, let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at TED, for the first time, on how an effective HIV vaccine might work.
Without a vaccine, these responses would have taken more than a week.
When these mutate, they change their shape, and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore.
And so, in a sense, our luck is holding out, but you know, another wild bird could fly over at anytime.
Now, in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS, we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together.
Now, what does this mean?
So think of it this way.
In the longer term, what they can do is use these tools of retro-vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine.
So if this works in humans, what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine, one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death.
So what happened?
The system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow.
So are we better prepared than we were in 1918?
And, aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings -- for example, the E. coli method I just talked about -- look at the time saved: this would be lives saved.
I say, "luckily" in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated.
Thank you.
So I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation, but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends.
Seth, most of us do work where every month, we produce something; we get that kind of gratification.
So what's really going on? Well, villages of the world are emptying out.
Education is the main event that can happen in cities.
Now we're shining right back up.
The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans who brook no nonsense about corruption.
Now, there are a lot of Africans who are very angry, angry at the condition of Africa.
Helping Africa is noble.
It leaks horribly.
Just add that up, all these leakages.
Now, the previous speaker before me, Idris Mohammed, indicated that we've had abysmal leadership in Africa.
Even if they had been able to name me 20, what does that tell you?
Government is the problem in Africa.
Take any African economy.
Now the modern sector, of course, is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into.
These two sectors, let me describe to you, have their own indigenous institutions.
If not, the people will abandon the chief, go somewhere else and set up a new settlement.
The American will say, "I am because I am, and I can damn well do anything I want, anytime."
When they make a profit it is theirs to keep, not for the chief to sequester it from them.
Nonsense.
The men are going fishing in these small boats.
Now, it is not just this informal sector.
Thank you very much.
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society.
They disappeared.
So here's my friend Scott's screen shot.
This is something that's sweeping the Web.
And what's in your filter bubble depends on who you are, and it depends on what you do.
So the best editing gives us a bit of both.
What we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones.
And so now, we're kind of back in 1915 on the Web.
And it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one.
It's a true story -- every bit of this is true.
We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper.
I fell asleep on the plane, until during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling.
I was going to talk about information ecology.
This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for January is 31 degrees. Last month was 39.5 degrees.
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks!
Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis.
Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community.
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow, re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and -- it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together.
Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring.
Again, the Republicans here, this shouldn't be partisan.
I'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since I was a little kid, and because I did, I wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved.
So the blowout in the Gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization.
And they can handle water.
You see a lot of oil on the shoreline.
They're not allowed to put more than 10 pounds of sand in a 50-gallon plastic bag.
They are very hardworking people.
Some people say there are not oil plumes.
But as many people have said, there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on.
These guys have to swim around through it.
And he moved away because it was his last fishing trip, and he knew that the dolphins scare fish.
The other thing about the Gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the Gulf at certain parts of the year.
I don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills.
So for instance, most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds.
Even when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, at least they shot back.
The dispersants make the oil go right under the booms.
Also, for all the shoreline that has booms -- hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline -- all of the shoreline that has booms, there's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms.
I think that's the most important thing that people have, is compassion.
It turns out that -- you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the United States -- you know, if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil, you would be in big trouble.
So I think that the oil blowout, the bank bailout, the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause.
I think there are signs of hope.
The first offshore wells were called whales.
We've been here before with energy, and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch, because the cheapest energy was slavery.
And the second point, making the case that kids can really change the world.
It doesn't produce more energy out than I put in, but it still does some pretty cool stuff.
And I've developed a system to produce medical isotopes.
So thank you very much.
And yet, I would like to think that I am more than my genes.
Sebastian Seung: What am I?
Its modest nervous system consists of just 300 neurons.
We don't know for sure, but there are theories.
Now you've probably seen pictures of neurons before.
If we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up, we get a three-dimensional image.
They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.
And so I think we're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience: how are the brains of men and women different?
One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons, because there can be synapses at these points of contact.
Neuroscience is hopeless."
And yet, I persist in this quixotic endeavor.
As you grow during childhood and age during adulthood, your personal identity changes slowly.
But that's not the whole story, because there are signals, electrical signals, that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch.
A cool and refreshing stream of water, you say.
And as I told you just now, neural activity can change the connectome.
Consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements, like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata.
And if that were successful, that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome.
And indeed, the popular press loves headlines like, "Anorexic brains are wired differently," or "Autistic brains are wired differently."
Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality, calling them fools?
I've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small, and propels us to the world of the far future.
Zach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team.
ZK: Now, it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are.
But we've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference.
Do you have a need for speed?
Now this is important for two reasons.
So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.
KS: Now, the interesting thing about this is, you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting.
You sir, come on up.
KS: Little bit -- that's perfect, just perfect.
All right, well thanks for coming up.
But today it's most widely used in office buildings -- in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid.
Shape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil, and it holds its place. Contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back.
This could totally change the way that you interface with paper.
Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off.
And he kind of comically explained that time after time, what the firemen would say is: they would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around; if there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go.
Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this, we would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket; something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent; every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more.
I went to Spain a few months ago and I had the best foie gras of my life.
It's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu, you risk being attacked.
I mean, I love the stuff.
Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras.
That is until last year, when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur, the coveted French gastronomic prize.
"Spanish chef accused of cheating."
He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras.
He repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him.
And finally, by the end of the day I was like, Ed-uar-do, you know like this?
Right along the fence line.
Why?
It really is the Garden of Eden.
He doesn't care.
You want to look and see what good foie gras is, it's got to be bright yellow.
And when they eat the seeds, their foie gras turns yellow.
But he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape.
And then they circle around.
They've come to stay?
They stop. They mate with his domesticated geese, and his flock continues.
And I'd like to make a metaphor, but I don't have one really.
It had all the qualities of foie gras, but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty.
But no.
How come no one's really heard of you?"
I flew home, I'm on the flight with my little black book and I took, you know, pages and pages of notes about it.
Insult to history.
They were looking for an alternative.
And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone.
Mega-farms, feed lots, chemical amendments, long-distance travel, food processing.
Jonas Salk has a great quote.
Farmers that rely on nature for solutions, for answers, rather than imposing solutions on nature.
Oh, I missed one: or E) none of the above?
Those fossil fuels have built our civilization.
Three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation.
Yet this cheaper energy system could support 158 percent bigger U.S. economy all without needing oil or coal, or for that matter nuclear energy.
Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day, plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs, raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP.
So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today, while the driving cost, even from the start, is very much lower.
Last year, Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon.
They can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos.
Also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R&amp;D has given us the Internet, the Global Positioning System and the jet engine and microchip industries.
So to get mobility without oil, to phase out the oil, we can get efficient and then switch fuels.
In fact, three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil, not in supply, but in demand.
Most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we're installing them.
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third.
For example, pumps, the biggest use of motors, move liquid through pipes.
Typically our retrofit designs save about 30 to 60 percent of the energy and pay back in a few years, while the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percent with generally lower capital cost.
For each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable, mainly lately in developing countries.
Actually no generator is 24/7. They all break.
In America, our aging, dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050.
At about the same cost as business as usual, this would maximize national security, customer choice, entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation.
It's fallen by half.
Now our team at RMI helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives, with some more hatching.
And our new book "Reinventing Fire" describes how you can capture it.
His was a lonely struggle, because Bihar was also India's most corrupt state, where public officials were enriching themselves, [rather] than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling.
It was Bihar all over again.
You know, developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S., Europe or the World Bank.
So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children, provoking new questions. Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help?
And as you can see, it's not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources.
And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working, aggregated in the red bubbles that you see, which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor.
He fought till the end, increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty, not only did government officials need to be honest, but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard.
You will understand nothing with my type of English.
When somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known, I mean, yes, lemon squeezer, toilet brush, toothpick, beautiful toilet seats, and why not -- a toothbrush?
After, there is people like me, who try to deserve to exist, and who are so ashamed to make this useless job, who try to do it in another way, and they try, I try, to not make the object for the object but for the result, for the profit for the human being, the person who will use it.
But when I come back, I can understand why I shall not do it, because today to not do it, it's more positive than do it, or how I shall do it.
Yes, point five, OK, OK, OK! I'm a designer, that's all, of Christmas gifts.
And we know, and especially Carolyn knows, that when the sun will implode, the earth will burn, explode, I don't know what, and this is scheduled for four, four billion years?
And if we don't deeply understand, if we don't integrate that we are mutants, we completely miss the story.
And to participate, for a mutant, there is a minimum of exercise, a minimum of sport.
You, you survive. It's OK.
Ptolemy, Eratosthenes, Einstein, things like that.
Come back. Because, after, there is another trap.
This line of evolution is clearly positive.
We can say, "It's luxurious time."
Forget all that. There is priority; there is urgency.
Because the scenario of this civilization -- about love, progress, and things like that -- it's OK, but there is so many different, other scenarios of other civilizations.
Because we have almost finished, I'll repeat this story.
What I want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what's scheduled.
And there are about 300 kids in this school, and the school's been going now for four years, and they're about to graduate their first class.
And this young man, his name is -- his last name Cruz -- he loved it. That's all over his Facebook page and it's gone viral.
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.""Let's practice. Everybody start chatting."
We teach them how to go right face, left face, so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions.
Yeah, and then when I ask you a question, there are only three possible answers: yes, sir; no, sir; and no excuse, sir.
They come to respect him.
No, no, it begins the first time a child in a mother's arms looks up at the mother and says, "Oh, this must be my mother.
And we're going to read to you."
And we are having difficulties in so many of our communities and so many of our schools where kids are coming to first grade and their eyes are blazing, they've got their little knapsack on and they're ready to go, and then they realize they're not like the other first graders who know books, have been read to, can do their alphabet.
I was a public school kid in New York City, and I didn't do well at all.
And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military.
Yep.
My gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family, a good family, but having a family that said to me, "Now listen, we came to this country in banana boats in 1920 and 1924.
Children need a network. Children need to be part of a tribe, a family, a community.
And they didn't care whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general, and they never expected any generals in the family, as long as you got an education and then you got a job.
We're investing in our future.
That's why we need sound immigration policy.
And I would order the hot dog from the guy, and he'd start to fix it, and then he'd look around at the bodyguards and the police cars -- "I've got a green card! I've got a green card!"
"Yes, yes.""Oh ... " I hand him the money.
What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube.
Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies to be in that room now, 24/7.
It asked customers to purchase chocolate with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones.
It may have jeopardized short-term sales, but it builds lasting, long-term loyalty based on shared values.
It does not tell the traveler where she's going until the very last minute, and information is provided just in time. Similarly, Dutch airline KLM launched a surprise campaign, seemingly randomly handing out small gifts to travelers en route to their destination.
At the end of the day, as hyperconnectivity and transparency expose companies' behavior in broad daylight, staying true to their true selves is the only sustainable value proposition.
Because everyone was a hero.
Everything was going wrong.
But in fact, the majority were scared.
There are lots of people who actually share the same dream.
Khaled Saeed was killed in June 2010.
People did not believe this.
Get those who killed this guy.
And next time it's going to be vibration."
In fact, the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas, help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing.
The revolution is happening.
And I went out.
Extremism became tolerance.
We're going to win because we don't have an agenda.
I feel that I have dignity that I have lost for so many years."
What we see here is a mother in India, and she's speaking Koro, which is a newly discovered language.
Babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven, and then there's a systematic decline.
What have we learned?
Two months later something incredible occurs.
And those distributions grow.
We're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize.
What we did was expose American babies during this period to Mandarin.
What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language.
Thankfully, we have a new machine, magnetoencephalography, that allows us to do this.
We're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap, so she's free to move completely unconstrained.
In investigating the child's brain, we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human, and in the process, we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives.
If you look at science on one hand, science is a very rational approach to its surroundings, whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings.
Now this happens very fast, in the blink of an eye, so, together with LG, we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than 3,000 frames per second.
Let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances.
Now I've got a live demonstration over here to show this to you.
So what happened now is, when the watercolor was flowing into the structure, the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid.
I can assure you I was fully conscious while I was taking those pictures.
And now I'm going to fill it with oxygen and whiskey.
So the images that you saw at the beginning, they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle, and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees.

Two weeks ago, I was in Bangalore in India.
I looked up.
And he walked in, and somebody said something to him, we realized he was deaf, and we looked into the rags, and there was this pair of eyes.
And that woman did not have sentimental compassion.
And if we're so blessed, we engage in activities that transform suffering.
But the conditions for compassion to be activated, to be aroused, are particular conditions.
Now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities.
Most of us are shrinking in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons, of the toxins of our world.
And that is the mental quality of equanimity.
Jody Williams called it: It's good to meditate.
He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg.
So why do we learn mathematics?
From the standpoint of calculation, they're as easy to understand as one plus one, which is two.
So one squared is one, two squared is four, three squared is nine, five squared is 25, and so on.
Let's see what we get there.
Fibonacci! Of course.
Well, on the one hand, it's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it, right?
If you divide 13 by eight, you get 1.625.
Then there was Aron Kader, who was the Palestinian-American.
So anyone who's gotten their passport in America will tell you, when you get your passport, it still says what country you were born in.
"Ah ha! American, great."
And I started freaking out, because I don't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into.
I want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank.
But the fact is, there's good people everywhere.
But what was interesting was, the Pakistani Muslim guy -- see he gives a bad name to Muslims and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world.
That's not one of us."
I encourage people always to go visit these places.
And what's crazy -- there's a recession going on, even in Dubai, but you wouldn't know by the prices.
The other thing you learn sometimes when you travel to these countries in the Middle East, sometimes in Latin American countries, South American countries -- a lot of times when they build stuff, there's no rules and regulations.
"Try the yogurt. It's very good. Little expensive."
I go, "He's got to be my driver."
Til then, I'll keep telling jokes. I hope you keep laughing.
He had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes.
Hold on.
We deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses.
MT: This one?
They forget the times they lose.
And when you give yourself over to that deception, it becomes magic.
And we have two main tools available at our disposal.
They teach us about what happens in the complex organism.
They're under constant mechanical forces.
It can do a tremendous amount of things.
We have three fluidic channels.
then we can add human white blood cells.
It's pretty exciting.
Cilia and the clearance of mucus are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis.
Now we have a whole pipeline of different organ chips that we are currently working on in our labs.
Does it get cleared by the liver?
Organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials in the future.
And this is the team and the people that are doing this.
This is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab, and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we're going to require in order to link 10 or more organ chips together.
I took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later, I was on my way to the emergency room with a full-blown asthma attack.
Here we have a story.
Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring, "Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"
Seven different salts.
I'm a monkey -- -- blowing kisses at a butterfly.
She just says, "No thank you."
They sat in silence through their trails, waving occasionally at family and friends.
In fact, I read it in the newspaper.
Because she believed that the only way to unblock what, at the time, was known as a blocked democracy, Italy, a country run by the same party for 35 years was the arms struggle.
But this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades, and then, later on, other arms organizations, including members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East, everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology, or politics.
So, because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms, all of the sudden I thought, maybe there is something here.
You know, that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism.
So, state sponsor of terrorism, feature of the Cold War.
And the IRA, which control the private transportation system in Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing.
Now, deregulation also brought back rogue economics.
Now, I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime, terror, and illegal economy, before 9-11.
These were money taken out in suitcases or in containers, in cash of course.
All the other countries, for example the United Kingdom, can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders.
What the Patriot Act did was to prohibit U.S. bank, and U.S.-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.
People simply moved their money-laundering activities away from the United States into Europe.
You got to question everything that is told to you, including what I just told you today.
This has given me a very special relationship with the ocean.
And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean, I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard, and I hope that it remains that way.
But that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years, until I reached my mid-30s and I thought, "You know, I'm not getting any younger.
I made a few changes, let go of some loose trappings of my old life, and through a bit of a leap of logic, decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean.
Oars are your only means of propulsion.
There were so many times when I thought I'd hit that limit, but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy.
Number one that I get asked: What do you eat?
On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles in the right direction.
Well, I leave that one up to you to judge.
It is really big -- 65 million square miles -- and to row in a straight line across it would be about 8,000 miles.
The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead.
So, the following year, I set out and, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.
Partly, they'd had a bit of a delay.
Fortunately, the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.
This is big trouble for these guys.
If the Atlantic was about my inner journey, discovering my own capabilities, maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey, figuring out how I can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world, and to take some of those things that I've learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in.
But what about if we just change that story?
Anything that we do spreads ripples.
I couldn't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me.
We just want to try and create that awareness because, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world, but that attitude, that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug, that is what could change the world.
So the bad news is that we all get sick.
And as long as we've looked for explanations, we've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science, which is hypotheses as to why we get sick, and as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick, we've tried to treat it as well.
But it wasn't until we tested it in people that we actually knew.
Clinical studies form the basis of how we investigate, so if we're going to look at a new drug, right, we test it in people, we draw blood, we do experiments, and we gain consent for that study, to make sure that we're not screwing people over as part of it.
The technology between these two pictures cannot be more different, but the methodology for clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period.
And this is an accident. These are tools that we created to protect us from harm, but what they're doing is protecting us from innovation now.
My sister is a cancer survivor.
And it's getting worse.
But more nontrivially, we can get our genotypes done, and although our genotypes aren't dispositive, they give us clues.
As you can see, I have high cholesterol.
So not that many programmers write free software, but we have the Apache web server.
If we have a lot of shared genotypes, and a lot of shared outcomes, and a lot of shared lifestyle choices, and a lot of shared environmental information, we can start to tease out the correlations between subtle variations in people, the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices, and there's open-source infrastructure to do all of this.
And open doesn't mean that there's no money.
I don't like being patient when systems are broken, and health care is broken.
You just have to be willing to be unreasonable, and the risk we're running is not the risk those 14 men who got yellow fever ran. Right?
You're like the Raspyni Brothers, where you've got your balls in cold water. And -- -- you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited.
But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.
And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way, we're going to think about it like this.
And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.
I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.
Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one the moment they saw one.
One very young, one a little more mature.
A brand-new way to put buildings together, something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.
It's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe, so the parts can all be cut at the same time.
And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.
And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard, and there it is fully built.
They were able to create that.
The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work in a very different fashion.
This is happening by itself.
It's about stimulation.
It's a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan, actually, for me.
Stand up for yourself.
I wanted a registered retirement savings plan that would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet.
I said, "I'd like to be a writer."
Granted, my dreams are shy, because they're Canadian.
My saying was going to be, "I'm taking out the trash!"
Standing up for yourself doesn't have to mean embracing violence.
When I was a kid, I used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing.
As far as I was concerned, life was pretty good.
She was eight years old, our first day of grade three when she got called ugly.
And they'll never understand that she's raising two kids whose definition of beauty begins with the word "Mom," because they see her heart before they see her skin, because she's only ever always been amazing.
Seems like every school has an arsenal of names getting updated every year, and if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear, do they make a sound?
Maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything.
We are graduating members from the class of We Made It, not the faded echoes of voices crying out, "Names will never hurt me."
I was constantly experimenting with these noises.
So there's things you can't do, and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me, because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world, but they're sketches at best, which is what's annoyed me.
How do I get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time.
You don't have to. It's fine. Check it out.
Impossible, you say. No.
I've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine.
Common knowledge, but important nonetheless.
That's French science.
It's believable, it's tactile.
This is my final piece.
Okay, that still works. Okay, good.
They're absolutely critical ecosystems, they clean air, they clean water, they sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases, and they're home to a huge diversity of species.
Well, the wintering ground is also critical and it also is not protected, and is potentially, could be potentially, exploited for gas and mineral rights.
I want to try to convey some sort of a sense of the size of this.
Now, you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well.
And here, massive amounts of water are super-heated and pumped through the ground, through these vasts networks of pipelines, seismic lines, drill paths, compressor stations.
So they decided to call it oil sands.
This might be, what? I don't know, half the size of Manhattan.
And he said, "When you go out on the river, do not under any circumstances eat the fish.
And what we're doing is we're destroying this carbon sink, turning it into a carbon bomb.
And also the last refuge for the largest herd of wild bison, and also, of course, critical habitat for another whole range of other species.
So the Great Bear Rainforest is just over the hill there, within a few miles we go from these dry boreal forests of 100-year-old trees, maybe 10 inches across, and soon we're in the coastal temperate rainforest, rain-drenched, 1,000-year-old trees, 20 feet across, a completely different ecosystem.
And the world certainly does not need the largest toxic impoundments to grow and multiply and further threaten the downstream communities.
We have an incredible gift in the boreal, an incredible opportunity to preserve our best defense against global warming, but we could let that slip away.
Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world like never before.
Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED I won't spend too much time on him here today, except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible visible.
He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin.
Raqib Shaw is Kolkata-born, Kashmir-raised, and London-trained.
He was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases, paintings of everyday objects, the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every Indian.
Thank you very much for looking and listening.
How many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand if you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised their hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience, go talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the best example of priming by experience that I know.
Right. Now, when -- it's interesting that when we look at an image we see, you know, color, depth, texture. And you can look at this whole scene and analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil.
Well, there's analog and digital. Thought that was appropriate here.
They're looking out two directions at once. You have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And that's something for you to think about, all right? So you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Which is impossible. You can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once. Now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape? They are.
So here's a food web, or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California.
The next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another, if you focus only on that link, and then you black box the rest, it's actually less predictable than if you step back, consider the entire system -- all the species, all the links -- and from that place, hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most.
Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times, I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to.
I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved.
Okay, some of you are looking a little bit skeptical.
For example, in my first TEDTalk, I did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games.
When we're on our deathbeds, will we regret the time we spent playing games?
Now, as far as I know, no one ever told one of the hospice workers, I wish I'd spent more time playing video games, but when I hear these top five regrets of the dying, I can't help but hear five deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill.
I wish I'd let myself be happier.
And we're going to come back to this one.
So I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms.
Now, why a game?
Things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes, or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once.
And soon I started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity, recruiting their own allies, and they were getting "super better" facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain, depression and Crohn's disease.
Well, it turns out there's some science here too.
I understand myself better. I know who I really am now.
Or better yet, is there a way to get all the benefits of post-traumatic growth without the trauma, without having to hit your head in the first place?
All you have to do is successfully complete the first four SuperBetter quests.
Every single second that you are not sitting still, you are actively improving the health of your heart, and your lungs and brains.
We know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle.
Sloth, giraffe, elephant, snake. Okay, let's see what we got.
And this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio.
Here's one more secret for you: Shaking someone's hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream, now that's the trust hormone.
So every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience, you're actually earning .128 more years of life or 46 more days of life, or 67,298 more minutes of life, which means every single day, you are earning 184 minutes of life, or every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience, like we just did together, you are earning 7.68245837 more minutes of life.
Pretty clever, right?
And it's a project that we've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world, who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project, in many of its different aspects.
The work involves hundreds of different crochet models.
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef.
Now I say "naively" because actually my profession is as a science writer.
And to cut a long story short, eight months later we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center's 3,000 square foot gallery.
And more and more people get involved in this, most of whom we've never met.
And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet. It happens to be a fact.
But what she was doing was actually making a model of a mathematical structure, that many mathematicians had thought it was actually impossible to model.
And what they do is, they do it through the concept of parallel lines.
Think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball, the surface of the Earth.
Does someone want to guess?
This is what it looks like.
It's a bit like this: imagine that we'd only ever encountered Euclidean space.
And the lines look curved.
Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate -- didn't know it was impossible to violate, and they're simply getting on with it.
It turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders.
And their individual visions, and their engagement with this mathematical mode.
And kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education, established by a man named Friedrich Froebel, who was a crystallographer in the 19th century.
But what we want to propose, is that the highest levels of abstraction, things like mathematics, computing, logic, etc. -- all of this can be engaged with, not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods, but by literally, physically playing with ideas.
How does this happen?
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.
This is called the Capgras delusion, and that is a patient, who's otherwise completely normal, has had a head injury, comes out of coma, otherwise completely normal, he looks at his mother and says, "This looks exactly like my mother, this woman, but she's an impostor.
Thank God, or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother.
You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans, or some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course.
But from that area, the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system, the emotional core of the brain, and that structure, called the amygdala, gauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at.
And I'll get to that in a minute.
It's some strange woman pretending to be my mother."
There's no emotional reaction to his mother, because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut.
When he sees her in person, he says it's an impostor.
And in fact, one student asked me the other day, "Do they get phantom PMS?"
The phantom limb -- they'll say, "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.
Patients become depressed.
The brain learns, because of this Hebbian, associative link, that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm.
OK? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box.
"Now," I said, "now, look, wiggle your phantom -- your real fingers, or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror."
He said, "Oh, I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful."
"Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again!"
So, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me, and he said, "Doctor, you're not going to believe this."
He said, "No, last three days, I've not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain, no clenching, no phantom forearm pain, all those pains are gone away.
It goes into a sort of denial -- negates the signals.
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin.
These people muddle up their senses.
Well, there are many theories.
Now remember -- why does this happen?
If it's between tone and color, you get tone-color synesthesia.
And, hence, the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets, artists and novelists.
How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Buba? Raise your hands.
The patient says, "Well, if it's metallic and shiny, it doesn't mean it's gold.
I work with a species called "Bonobo."
And it's used for communication.
Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.
So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo.
This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.
Slim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.
We have eight Bonobos.
I hope I have a lighter.
You're very happy about this part.
Goodbye.
Here Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands, to groom Nyota.
Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.
SS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do.
Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again.
This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.
The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world.
Is he looking for where the sound came from?
Take the cherries too.
SS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a "panhomoculture."
The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.
This artist's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.
On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.
I'm going to show you a movie simulation 16 powers of 10 faster than real time, which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out.
Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together.
One idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space, just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper.
And the most complex things are ourselves, midway between atoms and stars.
And it's this science, which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world, but also transforming our world faster than ever.
And the human impact on the global environment -- greenhouse warming, mass extinctions and so forth -- is unprecedented, too.
It was what he called "fine-grained relinquishment."
And perhaps the greatest living person is someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture -- outside the American Bible Belt, anyway -- but most people, even those who are familiar with evolution, aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead.
As I should have shown this earlier, it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun; it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.
Apart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly.
The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves -- the total output from all TV and cell phones and radar transmissions. And something else happened.
Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth spawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?
So that's wrong, and, in fact, if you think that, you're actually just not spending it right.
So they have more debt and worse friendships than they had before they won the lottery.
And so many of the comments were exactly of this type, where people got money and, in fact, it made them antisocial.
On one Vancouver morning, we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia and we approached people and said, "Do you want to be in an experiment?"
Some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars.
So if you give undergraduates five dollars, it looks like coffee to them and they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can.
In fact, it doesn't matter how much money you spent.
Or in Uganda, "Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people and describe that."
We went to a movie, we left early, and then went back to her room for ... " only cake -- just a piece of cake.
Perfectly nice thing to do.
Above, it's just kind of, I bought a gift for my mother.
And we can see what the relationship is between those two things.
Just below that to the right is Rwanda though, which is amazingly green.
Spend it on one of your teammates this week.
But when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates, they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money.
The teams that spend money on themselves are just the same winning percentages as they were before.
You and I can go on and buy it for them.
Last year here at TED I asked you to give me your data, to put your data on the web, on the basis that if people put data onto the web -- government data, scientific data, community data, whatever it is -- it will be used by other people to do wonderful things, in ways that they never could have imagined.
Look at Zanesville, Ohio.
You can burrow down by a particular type of spending, or you can go through all the different regions and compare them.
On a larger scale, this is a mash-up of the data which was released about the Afghan elections.
Each flash on this visualization -- put together by ITO World -- shows an edit in 2009 made to the Open Street Map.
After the earthquake, immediately, people all over the world, mappers who wanted to help, and could, looked at that imagery, built the map, quickly building it up.
Once upon a time, there was a place called Lesterland.
And in the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote, but in the Lester election, it's the Lesters who get to vote.
Okay. That's Lesterland.
And here's the key: There are just as few relevant funders in USA-land as there are Lesters in Lesterland.
Candidates for Congress and members of Congress spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time raising money to get back to Congress or to get their party back into power, and the question we need to ask is, what does it do to them, these humans, as they spend their time behind the telephone, calling people they've never met, but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent?
You know, there are Lesters from every part of social society.
I don't mean any criminal act.
One bit of good news is that it's bipartisan, equal-opportunity corruption.
But here's the bad news.
This is the root.
So I want you to take hold, to grab the issue you care the most about.
Turns out, the analytics here are easy, simple.
Those numbers have only gone up, and as United Republic calculated last April, the average increase in salary for those who they tracked was 1,452 percent.
But this is a problem of just incentives, just incentives.
There's nothing we can do."
I'm going off to build Google Glass.
Franklin said, "A republic, madam, if you can keep it."
The rocket was huge.
For days after the launch, Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity.
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases.
"Sputnik" will soon be released.
Maybe you thought that was scary, but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you're Jesus Christ.
Some of you are in the field, I can see.
You're driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible.
Your call. Your call.
Thank you.
It's interesting.
Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves.
When you're small and vulnerable, like these starlings, or like the fish, it helps to swarm to avoid predators, to confuse predators.
First, all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors.
Here on the model you see the predator attacking.
There are many eyes to spot danger.
We don't, however, really understand at a mathematical level.
But in Southeast Asia -- places like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo -- there's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies.
The combined light from these beetles -- these are actually tiny beetles -- is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers. It's stunning.
You can even be just a single cell.
You don't have to be alive. You don't have to be even a single cell.
I have some metronomes here.
They were in sync for a while, but then they drifted apart.
My wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over.
He said, "That's the vision I want to give to London.
It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down, rather like being on the boat.
Interviewer: Right, so, at least this much? Oh, yes.
That's right. And it seemed obvious to me that it was probably the number of people on it.
And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge.
Interviewer: You didn't expect. Engineer: Exactly.
AM: It captures a lot of the physics, yes.
Interviewer: No. If you try and put one foot in front of another, it's moving your feet away from under you. AM: Yes.
But then, of course, everyone is driving the bridge.
He was the most respected scientist in the field.
And when you go into the supermarket, you certainly don't see a lot of choices there.
We have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat, and we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice, but it's being lost.
And I never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand.
It's called "The Apples of New York" and this is the second volume.
I get this question all the time. Why don't we just save the best one?
Think of diversity as giving us options.
So I've picked two examples here, and I want to show you.
By 2030, if the maize, or corn, varieties, which is the dominant crop -- 50 percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field -- in 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in 2030.
If you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers, you dry it and then you freeze it.
So we needed a really safe place, and we went quite far north to find it.
The idea of Svalbard was that it's cold, so we get natural freezing temperatures.
I think of it as sort of a cathedral.
We're going up to over a million, and someday we'll basically have samples -- about 500 seeds -- of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility.
I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solution for climate change, for the water crisis.
It is, I agree, a nice thing to do.
30 million dollars in an endowment would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever.
Important health message: blogging may be hazardous to your health, especially if you are a male.
This is a very serious research, that you should read the underline.
Can you extract from Chris another minute and a half for me, because I have a video I have to show you.
And only last year I recognized that I'm a proud scrotum owner.
And I just want to show you that I'm not just preaching, but I also practice.
And that is, instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places, and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.
I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's -- the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though, is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later.
The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition.
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there; we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.
Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow, have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.
The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space, and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned space flights in the world -- the very first year.
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company.
And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.
But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry, big development, big improvement and capability and so on, and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; why do you need something better?
But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.
I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.
And that is because it's us. It's private industry.
Yesterday's Internet was a platform for the presentation of content.
I call them the Net Generation.
Our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age, everything from old models of the corporation, government, media, Wall Street, are in various stages of being stalled or frozen or in atrophy or even failing, and this is now creating a burning platform in the world.
The first is collaboration.
And he says, "Well I used to be a banker and now I'm a gold miner."
He gets submissions from all around the world.
They came from computer scientists, engineers.
And everywhere, our institutions are becoming naked.
But you also need to have values.
And there are all kinds of famous stories about this.
Do you know about this?
The open world is bringing freedom.
So the students would take their mobile devices, take a picture, triangulate the location, send that picture to friendly military units, who'd come in and take out the snipers.
Well, these wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum, and politics abhors a vacuum, and unsavory forces can fill that, typically the old regime, or extremists, or fundamentalist forces.
If you go back a few hundred years, all around the world it was a very closed society.
Martin Luther called the printing press "God's highest act of grace."
It's an age of vast promise, an age of collaboration, where the boundaries of our organizations are changing, of transparency, where sunlight is disinfecting civilization, an age of sharing and understanding the new power of the commons, and it's an age of empowerment and of freedom.
You can see on the right here, there's a predator being chased away by the collective power of the birds, and apparently this is a frightening thing if you're a predator of starlings.
Think about the kids today in the Arab Spring, and you see something like this that's underway.
There's a medical revolution happening all around us, and it's one that's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions, including cancer.
We get most of these blood vessels when we're actually still in the womb, And what that means is that as adults, blood vessels don't normally grow.
And in these situations, angiogenesis is out of balance.
And under the microscope, you can see hundreds of these brown staining blood vessels, capillaries that are feeding cancer cells, bringing oxygen and nutrients.
So the body's ability to balance angiogenesis, when it's working properly, prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers.
So, if angiogenesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one, then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply.
It invaded into his lungs.
We had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week.
There's 12 different drugs, 11 different cancer types.
And as a doctor, I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage, achieving a cure can be difficult, if not impossible.
Our search for this has taken us to the market, the farm and to the spice cabinet, because what we've discovered is that mother nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis.
And here is a growing list of our antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying.
Now, in the lab, we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar.
And that's what we're doing right now.
And, in fact, some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines.
If you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor, it loses weight.
Albert Szent-Gyorgi once said that, "Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen, and thinking what no one has thought."
The Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost 300 companies, and there are about 100 more drugs in that pipeline.
Okay. Well, thank you so much.
I did puzzles for "Bejeweled."
It could be an "L," of course.
Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play, toys and games -- by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.
The progression of my career that you'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.
Here we have "figure" in white.
I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have the numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.
So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.
Now, if you could pick up the black vase, it would look like the figure on top.
So, here is -- here is a couple pieces. Move them together, and now this is an active piece.
It's done very well. I love this puzzle.
The first move is going to be what?
Created a whole bunch of levels for it.
Cut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces, and then you look for overlaps, and you basically match them at the edges. And I said, "This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap."
So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content, rather than the other way around.
Finally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com, website you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim.
Then recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit.
So, we got games like "Brain Age" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.
I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media.
You get more -- Down, okay, yeah where is that?
And we have people all over the world doing that now.
And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell, the oppression of these cells, the reinterpretation of these cells, the undermining of these cells, getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing, eradicating, destroying, reducing these cells, basically began the process of killing off the girl cell, which was, by the way, patriarchy.
To be a man means not to be a girl.
I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo.
It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women have been raped there.
Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth, and excavating the Earth, and destroying things.
I actually realized once in Kosovo, when I watched a man break down, that bullets are actually hardened tears, that when we don't allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability, and have their compassion, and have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful and violent.
But I just want to say that I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns, who are literally being treated like ashtrays.
And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows.
I want the verb to be "educate," or "activate," or "engage," or "confront," or "defy," or "create."
I want to talk about Rachel Corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank to say, "End the occupation."
Dorcas is 15 years old, and she was trained in self-defense.
And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her we asked her what we could do for her, and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster."
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing.
She knew she would have to marry that old man, and she was 14.
In that hut, we walked in, and her father and his four wives were sitting there, and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled, and her primary mother, who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders.
And that is the power of transformation.
It's all bad. My brothers get everything."
I know when a storm is coming.
These feelings make me better.
I know that lipstick means more than show, and boys are super insecure, and so-called terrorists are made, not born.
Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off?
I love, I love, love, love being a girl!
That's the shooter I saw that killed the father."
Oh yes, no gun was ever found.
The other comes from an interesting aspect of human memory that's related to various brain functions but I can sum up for the sake of brevity here in a simple line: The brain abhors a vacuum.
But also because I have expertise and testify about the nature of human night vision.
And then take photographs, and this is what the scene looked like at the time of the shooting from the position of the teenagers looking at the car going by and shooting.
A good forensic expert also has to be a good educator, a good communicator, and that's part of the reason why we take the pictures, to show not only where the light sources are, and what we call the spill, the distribution, but also so that it's easier for the trier of fact to understand the circumstances.
It had a driver and a passenger, and after the car had passed the judge by, the passenger extended his hand, pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on, just as the teenagers had described it, right?
This judge is someone you'd never want to play poker with.
Why did I take the risk?
He -- His girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial, right? And she had a little baby boy.
The other one that I want to suggest, the caution that all of us have to have, I constantly have to remind myself, about just how accurate are the memories that we know are true, that we believe in?
I want to start my story in Germany, in 1877, with a mathematician named Georg Cantor.
And other mathematicians did the same sort of thing.
This made no sense at all, so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books.
It's very ironic. And I'll show you a little natural recursion here.
And so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold -- but when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief, and my French is not very good; I said something like, "I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof."
The rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back, and then you have the chief's ring here towards the back and then the chief's immediate family in that ring.
So I tried to come up with a seed shape, which, upon iteration, would unfold into this thing.
And the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales.
And that was actually my original hypothesis.
Second, you might ask, "Well, Dr. Eglash, aren't you ignoring the diversity of African cultures?"
It wasn't invented until the 1970s.
But they do it recursively, and they do it with an age-grade system, so the little kids learn this one, and then the older kids learn this one, then the next age-grade initiation, you learn this one.
Anywhere you go in the Sahel, you'll see this windscreen.
But it takes a lot of time, and it takes a lot of straw because they're really tight."
And they wouldn't tell me.
But I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed, buried in sand, and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on.
They're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this.
George Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra, and John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer.
So it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics, that it's not just about singing and dancing.
Actually, the reason that Google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web.
So if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work, we need look only no farther than Africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms.
Every parent I know, myself included, feels like we're constantly playing defense.
So how can we change this dynamic?
One has lacrosse on the near side of town.
You have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing.
They were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done.
So instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network," you say, "You go off and come up with one element, then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt."
So the Starrs, in adapting this to their home, created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores.
He said, "In the workplace, adults love it.
What didn't work well? Our math sheets, or greeting visitors at the door.
Kick someone, lose desserts for a month.
I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.
Parents can learn a lot from that.
I'm not home, can't make family dinner?
If you're sitting on a cushioned chair, you'll be more open."
Plank number two: Empower your children.
So we kind of liked that.
But we're giving them practice becoming independent, which of course is our ultimate goal.
And I said, "But what if they drive into a ditch?"
So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.
We don't like dilemmas. We like solutions.
Suddenly we had a way into the conversation.
So my final plank is, tell your story.
I've mentioned just three here today: Adapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story.
Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion.
I'm here to show you how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.
The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is, and if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic.
So very small, but very useful.
And it has billions of interstitial spaces, and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles, reach up and grab the air molecules, and cover the surface with air.
It could be anti-corrosion.
[Two minutes later...] He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.
Dorothy Parker, mean, drunk and depressed. Sweeney: I know.
Sobule: Hillary supported the war. Sweeney: Even Thomas Friedman supported the war. Sobule: Colin Powell turned out to be ... Together: ... such a pussy. Sobule: William Faulkner, drunk and depressed, Tennessee Williams, drunk and depressed. Sweeney: Yeah.
And the basic idea is that there's this law of attraction, and your thoughts have this vibrating energy that goes out into the universe and then you attract good things to happen to you.
So let the story begin.
When a word was mentioned, an image of it instantly appeared in his mind.
I could picture them as real in my mind, and there I run it, test it and improve it.
He even photographed the bones of the human body.
NT: Yes, that was a big mistake.
Tesla's insight was profound.
The challenge of looking at nature's designs -- and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it, and the way we've used it.
And you can absolutely never, absolutely never, because of history and the inherited plan, start with a clean slate.
How can you make sense of this? Well, we believed -- and we hypothesized -- that one way animals could work simply, is if the control of their movements tended to be built into their bodies themselves.
And they asked us this question. They say, "Why model just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane, when you're telling us these animals are moving in the horizontal plane?" This is a good question.
That's enough!
This is a collaboration we have with Stanford.
Here's what some of you did this morning, although you did it outside, not on a treadmill.
Well, we wanted to see if they allowed the animals to have greater stability and maneuverability.
It's this technique of building the properties into the form.
I presented this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA, and they said that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice, and life, ultimately, on Mars. And he said -- especially with legged-robots, because they're way too complicated.
It's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill.
And here's some video at 1,000 frames per second.
Here are the robots that they inspire, the Mecho-Geckos from iRobot.
And if you look at the toes, they have these little leaves there, and if you blow them up and zoom in, you'll see that's there's little striations in these leaves.
They were so large that a patch of hairs about this size -- the gecko's foot could support the weight of a small child, about 40 pounds, easily. Now, how do they do it?
If you put their foot under water, they grab on.
Clearly, the Internet is already having eyes and ears, you have web cams and so forth. But it's going to also have legs and hands.
And the problem is this: Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world.
showed that, of married senior managers, two-thirds of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children.
So the question is, how are we going to fix this?
What are the messages we tell the women who work with and for us?
So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone.
When I was in college my senior year, I took a course called European Intellectual History.
The three of us go to the exam together, and we sit down.
If you test men and women, and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs, men get it wrong slightly high, and women get it wrong slightly low.
I wish the answer were easy.
And she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley, and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist.
But Heidi? Not so sure.
And she said, "I learned something today.
I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home.
I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers, and it's hard.
"How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing?"
But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back?
My generation really, sadly, is not going to change the numbers at the top.
I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home, and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments.
Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do.
So the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making -- giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them, but actually leads them to make better decisions, better choices in their lives.
So this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one, because it was very simple, so it's an easy story to tell.
They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth.
This was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth.
It was a notion that really came out of Albert Bandura's work, who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment.
This is still the way we're communicating messages about health.
You need to connect it to their lives, hopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand.
Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion for behavior change.
The choice in this case is pretty simple.
But by and large, this is a feedback loop that's so nifty and too rare.
So it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information, and it just sounds perfect.
And they created this thing called the "drug facts box."
You can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects.
They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients.
It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know.
All those other values, all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing, we summarize.
They have this huge amount of space, and they don't use it for anything, so we do.
The last one I'll show you is a PSA test.
So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right.
It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change.
And then, what's next?
And this information is out there.
It's very powerful for, I think, changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend.
How was our role in this garden similar and different?
And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right?
And suddenly everything looked different.
That a certain kind of potato, a certain kind of drug, a sativa-indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us.
Ugh. Mini-Me.
Well, consciousness."
So who's the more sophisticated species?
And you will see, the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us.
It's permaculture, those of you who know a little bit about this, such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ...
They graze everything down, intensive grazing.
And third, while they're in this paddock they are, of course, defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field.
again, give each species what it wants, let it realize its desires, its physiological distinctiveness.
It's created from the bottom up.
This is a way to reanimate the world, and that's what's so exciting about this perspective.
And he kind of nodded, you know?
That was the computer we knew.
So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory, to the CPU, the VRAM, etc., and it's an actual working computer. That's a bus, really.
Remember when images were first possible with a computer, those gorgeous, full-color images?
We're kind of stuck in a loop, perhaps, and this sense of possibility from computing is something I've been questioning for the last 10 or so years, and have looked to design, as we understand most things, and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine.
Like, aww, that's not fearful. That's actually funny.
I can never get in there.
So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.
We'd go to a computer store, and they'd do the same thing.
There's a shift.
Thank you.
You know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road, they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it.
"Tell us more." "Oh, it's really old."
So art makes questions, and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions.
And what is that, structurally?
And this frame is important today, in this complex, ambiguous space, and artists and designers have a lot to teach us, I believe.
Whether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy, it's a wonderful design challenge.
How many coffees do you have?
My name's Seth Priebatsch. I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR.
And it looks like this right now.
And so, sort of, the crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game dynamics, really interesting things, that, if you use consciously, you can use to influence behavior, both for good, for bad, for in-between.
I like it quite a lot.
The game layer is all about influence.
The resources are mindshare and the tools, the raw materials are these game dynamics.
So the first one -- the most famous appointment dynamic in the world -- is something called happy hour.
If you haven't, I recommend playing it.
This is a local company called Vitality, and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time.
We're going to jump onto the next one, maybe. Yes.
I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am, and I need that.
If we called valedictorian a "white knight paladin level 20," I think people would probably work a lot harder.
This is used all over the place, including LinkedIn, where I am an un-whole individual.
The average player spends something like six, six-and-a-half hours a day on it.
And this is powerful enough that we can see that it hooks people into these dynamics, pulls them back to the same local businesses, creates huge loyalty, creates engagement, and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses.
But it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal, a group of people, the top seven on the leader board, who would work together to make sure they maintained that position.
And the winner was actually a group out of MIT, where they created sort of a pyramid scheme, a network, where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $2,000 and anyone else to push that recommendation up also got a cut of it.
Sergey Brin: I want to discuss a question I know that's been pressing on many of your minds.
SB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it.
You can see that Japan is busy at night, right there.
And this is something that we should really work on, which is Africa, which is just a few trickles, basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.
And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.
And it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce, or in this case, ketchup.
Anyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves -- hopefully that search will work.
One of the earlier results that we got -- we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of 25 Vietnamese girls for their education, and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been many, many stories that have come in, because we do have hundreds of charities in there, and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.
This is one of our engineers.
You can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there.
And -- well, I'll leave you in suspense.
And News, which I just mentioned, was started by a researcher.
And this is how we keep our innovation running.
We would never do such a crazy thing, but -- in any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them, that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.
All right, see? You guys should try it out.
We also like to innovate in our physical space, and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off, and they're noisy, so people shut them off.
I just wanted to show quickly.
And we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.
I just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month.
And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.
And so we'd say, you know, "Did you mean 'search for'" -- what is this, in this case, "Saddam Hussein," because this blog is about Iraq -- and you know, in addition to the ads, and we thought this would be a great idea.
And finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass."
And that's unlike many of our competitors.
I put an attractive shell around some new technology.
But this wasn't always the way.
Now, this was back in the 19th century.
In the case of design, that means balancing desirability, what humans need, with technical feasibility, and economic viability.
And that's happening through the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems -- to global warming, to education, healthcare, security, clean water, whatever.
So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India, they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening their parents.
And the faster we do that, the faster our ideas evolve.
Because they brought the cost down from $200 a pair, down to just $4 a pair.
Hilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater, and Hugo Manassei of Participle have taken this idea of participation, and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0, they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state.
When you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system, it resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.
And that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society -- how we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves, how we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.
But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?
And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new social marketing campaigns, community outreach strategies, business models, new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water.
And if you've got any ideas then feel free, you can post them to Twitter.
Today, I'm going to take you around the world in 18 minutes.
"I understand," I said, "that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea, but I'd like to put some sugar in my green tea."
But from the Japanese perspective, it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better -- in this case, the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice.
This is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for.
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do, and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with.
One girl named Mary said, "You asked my mother?"
When, in contrast, two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected, then they may amplify one another's success by turning choosing into a collective act.
You will surely find the perfect match.
Again and again, they perceived these seven different sodas, not as seven choices, but as one choice: soda or no soda.
When asked, "What words and images do you associate with choice?"
I don't mean to say that I want no choice, but many of these choices are quite artificial."
It's not a marker of liberation, but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae.
and then hop across the pond to France.
What do any parent do?
French parents were more likely to say things like, "Noah was here for so little time, but he taught us so much.
These parents could not contemplate giving up the choice, because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught and everything they had come to believe about the power and purpose of choice.
Americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice, believing that they will be, or ought to be, welcomed with open hearts and minds.
Instead of replacing one story with another, we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written.
But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind.
And so I asked these two ladies, and the one lady told me, "Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'" "Well, what does it look like?"
Okay, we got that.
Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena.
And I had a chance to go in the Gulf of Mexico and meet some fishermen and see the terrible conditions in which they were working.
These are enormous forces.
Then I started publishing online, and some friends from Korea, they started being interested in this, and we made a boat which has a front rudder and a back rudder, so we started interacting with this, and it was slightly better, although it was very small and a bit off balance, but then we thought, what if we have more than two points of control?
And this is exactly what we're looking [for] if we want to pull something long and heavy.
So what we are doing is an accelerated evolution of sailing technology.
Now, if you're taking the same system, and you're putting vertical, you're bending, and if you're moving this way forward, your instinct will tell you that you might go this way, but if you're moving fast enough, you might create what we call lateral lift, so we could get further or closer to the wind.
You want everybody, like we're doing now, to work at the same time, and that can only happen if these people all together decide to share the information, and that's exactly what open hardware is about.
With this money, I hired a team of young engineers from all over the world, and we rented a factory in Rotterdam in the Netherlands.
And what puts us together is that we have a common, at least, global understanding of what the word "business" is, or what it should be.
So, this small machine that you've seen, we're hoping to make small toys like one-meter remote control Protei that you can upgrade -- so replace the remote control parts by Androids, so the mobile phone, and Arduino micro-controller, so you could be controlling this from your mobile phone, your tablet.
Thank you very much.
And I said, just arrange these, from what's important to you and what's not, and then tell me why.
Girl 2: That would be so stressful.
The next year they march forward and they introduce Qube, the first interactive cable TV system, and the New York Times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home, convergence, great things are happening.
Four hundred million dollars, which was real money back in the '70s.
But it's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing.
Would you like if I used the machine?
And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory, the velocity, you will notice, has dropped off to a minimum.
We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever, and knowing a good thing when it sees it, the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us.
This new computer, built to become the nerve center of a defense network, is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid.
If we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know, say, Century City, it would fit beautifully.
All of this stuff starts moving into industry.
In fact, despair is in the air.
Put out your Magic Window and your erasing glove, and rub it like this.
I assure you, that's not the case.
He actually understood something about a theme that we've been discussing all week. It's the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications.
You have extreme concern with everybody else's business and much involvement in everybody else's life.
And when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations, it's not just a joke about messianism, it's actually what we do.
There was the Vietnam War. There was black liberation.
The title of the book is, "What the Dormouse Said: How the '60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry."
Heck, it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure.
PH: I hope you realize how subversive that is.
We were plenty aware that we were messing with media, and on the surface, it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things, but we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look.
Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.
Computers, once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks, escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas.
PH: We missed a lot. You know, you missed, we missed the Internet, the long tail, the role of the audience, open systems, social networks.
It's a customer, it's an audience, it's a person who's participating.
"Websites attract striking writers: operators of sites like MyDamnChannel.com could benefit from labor disputes."
Here is a clip from a video, from a piece of animation that was written by a writer in Hollywood, animation worked out in Israel, farmed out to Croatia and India, and it's now an international series.
What the entertainment business is struggling with, the world of brands is figuring out.
Or, as Geoffrey Moore once told me, it's intellectual curiosity that's the trade that brands need in the age of the blogosphere.
They think of the old medium, because the old medium is always the content of the new medium, as movies tend to be the content of TV, and as books used to be the content, novels used to be the content of movies.
I take about 5,000 photographs a year, and I thought that I would edit from these, and try to come up with some images that might be appropriate and interesting to you.
This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach, a company dealing with simple forms, making good designers available to us, and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well, and it seems to have worked.
And so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike, but being a very good example of design.
And going a little closer, you get a different perspective.
Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture, and the way that the trees form vertical elements.
Simple menus put on a board, achieving, kind of, the sort of balance.
Sometimes a trash can -- this is just in the street in San Francisco -- a trash can that's been left there for 18 months creates a nice 45-degree angle against these other relationships, and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture.
And I came across this little street in Venice, where the communist headquarters were sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine.
And I came down one day, and all the bikes were red.
I don't have very many shots of people, because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form.
But they're real examples in urbanization and the change that's occurred in the last number of years, and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers.
There are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago, and then there are your big-D design statements: the Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry.
Thank you very much.
Everything about flying in those years, which was -- you have to stop and think for a moment -- was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time.
You know, from a romance language.
You had to learn about aeronautics.
I had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing.
Went through design, some architecture.
I wanted to get back where the romance was.
So the discipline was -- as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air, for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body, and what the body needs, wants, indicates it needs.
Design nowadays, if you mean it, you don't start with styling sketches.
I'll tell you right up front, this is a trade off.
She said, "Oh I love it."
I had one for a wristwatch once. 20 pages.
And they go up easily.
Would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone?
When you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end, and transfer it to your back.
I've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place.
You cant hit your elbow on bottom.
And you would think, would you not, that with all our science, with all our advances in society, with better towns, better civilizations, better sanitation, wealth, that we would get better at controlling mosquitos, and hence reduce this disease.
Now let's assume you go on holiday.
It's called breakbone fever, because that's how you can feel.
Now, in fact, a single mosquito will only travel about 200 yards in its entire life. They don't travel very far.
Once you've got the mosquito in your area, anyone coming into that area with dengue, mosquito will bite them, mosquito will bite somewhere else, somewhere else, somewhere else, and you'll get an epidemic.
The second way you can do it is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around.
There's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there.
We want something that's relatively cheap, or cost-effective, because there's an awful lot of countries involved, and some of them are emerging markets, some of them emerging countries, low-income.
Now there are two features of mosquito biology that really help us in this project, and that is, firstly, males don't bite.
Now if that male is carrying a gene which causes the death of the offspring, then the offspring don't survive, and instead of having 500 mosquitos running around, you have none.
So about 10 years of internal evaluation, testing, to get this to a state where we think it's actually ready.
And we've got a production unit in Oxford, or just south of Oxford, where we actually produce these mosquitos.
The males have been put in little pots and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go.
I'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies don't work well or have become unacceptable.
I found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward, recuperating from emergency surgery.
And you know why I understand that?
We all have these.
And I don't wander far from that place for a majority of my time, even though I'm an extensive global trekker.
They manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene.
If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about.
Now, I've circled the places where I've been.
But none of that's in my medical record.
And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA.
I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill, because of this report."
I could have made the decision, if I had this information, not to move to the ozone capital of the United States, couldn't I? I could make that decision.
And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy. Thank you.
You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection.
Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy."
He forms an attachment to kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom, who downloads the boy in the orchard, the emperor of oranges, who grows up to be me -- the guy who usually goes too far.
We can interfere with the interface.
Okay, so most of you are.
Now, the problem is that if I ask, why do we find ourselves in this situation with blue algae?
Several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements: phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium.
Experts in the field will know that cellular communication is phosphorus-based -- phosphorylation, dephosphorylation.
So, we humans get it from the things we eat: plants, vegetables, fruits, and also from eggs, meat and milk.
So, in order to understand these issues, where do we find our phosphorus?
Nobody wants to throw their money out the window, but unfortunately that's what is happening here.
What you are seeing here is an open-pit mine in the U.S., and to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine, if you look in the top right-hand corner, the little crane you can see, that is a giant crane.
In 2030, we'll reach the peak.
So, we will have less phosphorus, but we'll need to produce more food.
By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association which is also called mycorrhiza.
It can go beyond the root's one-millimeter scope to seek out phosphorus.
Now let's add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram I used earlier.
The mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form and making it available for the plant to use.
Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other.
We have a technology that works, and one that, if used correctly, will alleviate some of the pressure we are putting on the world's phosphorus reserves.
In the 15th century, the decimal point was invented; architects stopped using fractions, and they had a new model of nature.
Frei Otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams and foam bubble models to generate his Mannheim Concert Hall.
Beautiful, because it has symmetry.
So, in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components, so there might be up to, say, 50,000 pieces of material in this room you're sitting in right now that all need to get organized.
The intricacies of scale that come out of that -- you know, in the example of the nose to the face, there's a fractional part-to-whole idea.
And you also get a sense of visual movement in the space, because every one of the elements is changing in a pattern, so that pattern leads your eye towards the altar.
So, every one of them is a little bit different-shaped as you move down the length of the building.
So, the 300 series, or whatever their newest car is, the 100 series that's coming out, has to look like the 700 series, at the other end of their product line, so they need a distinct, coherent identity, which is BMW.
The titanium's several thousand dollars, but the forms are very cheap.
I got interested in them because they're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the -- let's call it the decoration -- I know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration, but that's how it works -- are all intricately connected to one another.
We were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design.
About six years ago, I bought one of these CNC mills, to just replace, kind of, young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models.
Let's first visit our planet, but at night, and from space.
And these cows are eaten basically in South America, in Brazil and Argentina. They're not being shipped up here.
So one of the questions we've been asking is, how much of the world is used to grow food, and where is it exactly, and how can we change that into the future, and what does it mean?
We're using a planet's worth of land already.
But if we come back today, during a normal condition to the exact same location, this is what's left.
The reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side, you see two little rivers kind of coming down through the sand, feeding this basin with water.
Imagine that was Lake Huron.
You can walk there today.
Well, that's the future we have to look forward to.
It's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any human activity in the world.
It's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity.
This is an analysis we've done, where on the left is where the crops are today, on the right is where they could be based on soils and climate, assuming climate change doesn't disrupt too much of this, which is not a good assumption.
It's going to either be organic or conventional or some mix of the two to deliver that.
Now, when I talk about this, people often tell me, "Well, isn't blank the answer?" -- organic food, local food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills -- and yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here, but not any one of these is a silver bullet.
At this rate, we'll reach 9 billion people by 2040.
Global croplands cover 16 million km².
Some dry up altogether.
Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation, methane from animals and rice fields, and nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing.
Advocates of commercial agriculture, environmental conservation, and organic farming...
It's built over the lagoon, and there are no streets where there can be stores to shop, and so the store comes to you.
Andrew spent 16 years scavenging materials on the dump, earned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler, which meant he carried a scale and went around and weighed all the materials that people had scavenged from the dump. Now he's a scrap dealer.
All of this is happening openly, and aboveboard.
We're all focusing on — this is a statistic from earlier this month in the Financial Times — we're all focusing on the luxury economy.
Big businesses have recognized this, and what's fascinating about this slide, it's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads and run around without dropping them off.
And then there's mobile phones.
They're going to Eddy in Lagos.
You can buy cloned cologne.
All of System D really doesn't pay taxes, right?
And third is, and I'm taking this from the great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg, that alternate economies barter and different kinds of currency, alternate currencies are also very important, and he talked about buying what he needed just with his good looks.
I really think that this subtitle explains what somebody like me, who's sort of a Darwin wannabe, how they actually look at one's role in sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine.
And in particular, to think about a fundamental idea which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms.
So, I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases.
And so, the theory tells us that when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water, we expect them to be more predator-like, more harmful.
But it doesn't tell you how long.
It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine, and then that fluid goes the only way it can, which is out the other end.
Now, I can think of some possible experiments.
Just to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about.
And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador, which has some of the least well protected?
That's how much we have in America, cholera that's acquired endemically, and we don't think we've got a problem here.
But there's another really interesting aspect of this, and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence, evolution of harmfulness, then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance.
So, we can go to the same countries and look and see.
They got the organism to evolve to mildness, and they got no development of antibiotic resistance.
And the logic's a little more subtle here.
They had dammed up the Tennessee River.
And these are the data.
But as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria, you're certainly not going to eradicate.
But as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases, and it ought to.
Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area?
Anyhow, I'll end that there, and thank you very much.
There's also a huge emotional impact.
Unfortunately, we don't do great with upper-limb prosthetics.
The state of the art is what we call myoelectric prostheses.
You're missing not only these muscles, but your hand and your elbow too.
And we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms that were funded by the U.S. military, using these prototypes, that had up to 10 different degrees of freedom including movable hands.
And if I tap the nerve ending on a World War II vet, he'll still feel his missing hand.
Imagine, with somebody who's lost their whole arm, we still have four major nerves that go down your arm.
Jesse came to us at the RIC to be fit with these state-of-the-art devices, and here you see them.
And after about three months, the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch.
That's why it's intuitive.
His hand sensation grew into his chest again probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat, so the skin was right down to the muscle and deinnervated, if you would, his skin.
This was one of our first patients, Chris.
And I was driving home from work, and a truck was coming the opposite direction, came over into my lane, ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off.
You had to concentrate a whole lot.
AK: A little faster. And much more easy, much more natural.
And the most important thing is our patients have appreciated it.
And here you can see, on Jesse's chest, when he just tried to do three different things, you can see three different patterns.
It's about seven pounds, which is probably about what my arm would weigh if I lost it right here.
So if it stopped working, I just had to take it off.
And I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago.
But my favorite one was just when the hand was open, because I work with kids, and so all the time you're clapping and singing, so I was able to do that again, which was really good.
So that's an exciting laboratory experiment on how to give back, potentially, some skin sensation.
We're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do.
So those are just some of our goals.
And fortunately, it worked today.
She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she'd received during the trial, or even what the trial had been about.
On the contrary, clinical trials are extremely useful tools, and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries.
As funding for HIV research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict, you can see why this context becomes very, very attractive.
Local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials, as well as the incentives for participation.
It is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial, and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study.
In addition, they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends.
If you come from a developing country like myself, I urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country.
So the fundamental problems that we face are overconsumption and too many people.
But it's alive with life; it's hardly uninhabited.
You have to train to be able to do that.
And that's what I came to study.
And this is true of most of our living systems.
This is a cold-water event called La Nina.
And you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins, and you're in the middle of an El Nino event and there are no penguins.
This is a picture at Punta Tombo in February showing all the penguins along the beach.
And so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins.
Why do they do that? Because it's cheaper, because they don't pay the real environmental costs.
Eventually, the government listened and, amazingly, they changed their laws.
But we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go.
The same thing's true for penguins as well.
This is Turbo the Penguin.
What is this guy doing?
And penguins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another.
And then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by.
So, thank you very much.
Most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots on this screen, of the many more that represent 90 percent of the world economy.
And we can try to anticipate those changes, and shape them in a more constructive direction.
Then came the end of the Cold War.
And they share a lengthy land border.
We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.
But who is it going to feed?
But hold on. This map is 700 years old.
So let's look at how China is re-establishing that hierarchy in the far East.
Specifically, it targets Japan and Korea and Australia, countries that are strong allies of the United States.
Some of these organizations don't even have the United States as a member.
Well, if you remember before World War II, Japan had a vision for a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.
Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.
If the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms of their own statehood.
Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region.
The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine is that independence alone, without infrastructure, is futile.
These countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees.
And I assure you it's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.
It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union.
The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries, and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany to happen in a peaceful way.
What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.
Now let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus.
This is the flag that flies in the minds of 20 million Pashtuns who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.
Now let's go up to the Arctic Circle.
And like our relationship with the ecosystem we're always searching for equilibrium in how we divide ourselves across the planet.
This is a dream of the ages.
So we've set out to look for genes that control aging.
And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.
You're going to see, in just two weeks, the normal worms are old.
It's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home; it's going skiing.
You would never know, until she told you.
Okay, so what is the daf-2 receptor telling the inside of the cell?
There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin.
So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans, people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation, the hormone receptor mutation, in other animals, will they live longer?
And just like any population, most of the people live to be about 70 or 80, but some live to be 90 or 100.
So it's really interesting, and it makes sense in a way, that they're still young, so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old?
You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.
These animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.
You can store the food, use it for energy, grow, etc.
So he doesn't actually do anything himself.
And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100.
There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.
So this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer.
You could change the genes in principle.
There's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about, which is a negligible senescence.
And there are other examples of these kinds of animals, like turns, certain kinds of birds are like this.
CK: Yes, that's right.
I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn't actually exist, but rather, that people do care, but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way.
Now that would never happen.
So you're never going to see them on a billboard.
Here's a great article about an important election race that's happening.
Someone came up to them and said, "You're the chosen one.
As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead, or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy, they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership, which is that it comes from within.
As you may have noticed, our elections in Canada are a complete joke.
As long as we believe that people, our own neighbors, are selfish, stupid or lazy, then there's no hope.
And raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness in humans.
We tend to view them -- and the popular press aids and abets this view -- as chemical imbalances in the brain, as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.
It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way.
So if we inhibit a particular type of neuron, and we find that a behavior is blocked, we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior.
Seymour recruited me to CalTech in the late 1980s.
So three important ones that I can think of are persistence, gradations in intensity, and valence.
And what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puff-o-mat several puffs in a row, they became somewhat hyperactive and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to calm down.
That's right -- flies, like people, have dopamine, and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and I have.
As many of you know, individuals afflicted with ADHD also have learning disabilities.
Now what's the causal relationship, if anything, between these phenotypes?
But in each fly, we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others, and then we test each of these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity.
If we can do that, we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects, putting the oil back in our mental engines, just where it's needed. Thank you very much.
Why does she receive more bites than I do?
Why did we set up these experiments?
On the left here you see the bites by the Dutch malarial mosquito on this person.
Limburg, be proud of your cheese, as it is now used in the fight against malaria.
They're all together there. They are immobile.
He's examining these holes, and now he's got it already.
In fact, people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos.
Here we go.
We can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito-born diseases, of epidemics, right?
Next, raising the money to fund the procedure.
And the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living, related donors -- relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ, like a split liver graft, to a relative or loved one.
Pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman's life.
And in my mind, I realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence.
The observation that stem cells, as master cells, could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types -- heart cells, liver cells, pancreatic islet cells -- captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public.
And as it turns out, fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells.
Heart disease, stroke, diabetes, spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy, retinal eye diseases -- are any of these conditions relevant, personally, to you?
Stem cell-derived retinal transplants, now in a research phase, may one day restore vision, or part vision, to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide.
1.1 million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly.
And in the U.K., neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial.
Gustavo Dudamel: Hi everybody in L.A.
A Mexican composer: Arturo Marquez.
These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb. weight gain, until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace.
But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things -- respect, excitement, a broken Internet connection, mind-numbing monogamy -- and the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket.
And it turns out, the success stories share a few similarities, actually, beyond they don't have sex with other people.
For example, the happy wife.
Here's an interesting one.
But still, I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and I'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce.
Apparently, the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us, but it obviously hasn't and it probably never will, makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison.
And I'm thinking they've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could.
The bottom line is, whether you're in it or you're searching for it, I believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting.
And also, my husband does a lot around the house, and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives.
That's exactly what I do -- optical mind control.
Take a look at what brain activity might look like.
To make progress, we need to break the code.
And since I'm realistic, rather than grandiose, I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries.
It's hard to do in animals that run around, and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously.
I hope you'll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept.
This is because, although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes, different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells.
You're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you when you try to swat the fly.
Anyway, as you'll see in a moment, Susana was able to turn on the flight motor of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies and get some of the headless bodies to actually take off and fly away.
Our actions change the environment, or context, and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop.
We can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model by assuming that the fly's brain contains not only an Actor, but a different group of cells, a "Critic," that provides a running commentary on the Actor's choices.
And whenever they made one of the two choices, chose one odor, in this case the blue one over the orange one, we switched on the lights.
But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different.
In fact, it makes so much sense that we can construct an electronic toy circuit that simulates the behavior of the fly.
In a situation like this, we would expect the Critic to speak up and to tell the Actor to change its policy.
There are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done, but we still haven't solved a single example of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter.
Now, with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis, it just sucked me in immediately, as if I began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me, until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room, who became a dear friend, and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases, and said, "Eric, these people who get this are normally in their '70s and '80s.
And it's dependent on passive patients who just take it and don't ask any questions.
So we're going to actually do a live exam to sort of see how Libby's doing.
All right, I gotta gel up.
So I just wanted to see, is this the image you need to get?
ED: All right. This is kind of hard to do with one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring, but I've got it, I think, and I'll save that image and send it to you.
All right. So what you're sort of seeing here is an example of disruptive technologies, of mobile, social and analytic technologies.
Now I personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age.
Many of us will have implantables that will actually look real-time at what's going on with our blood chemistry and in our proteins right now.
And I have these palpitations that are showing up.
And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy.
My team is actually working in China on one of these self-care models for a project we called Age-Friendly Cities.
Now, I've had two examples I want to quickly share with you of this kind of care customization on my own journey.
Now it took about two weeks of processing on Intel's highest-end servers to make this happen, and another six months of human and computing labor to make sense of all of that data.
So Tracey, just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you.
Let me share with you today an original discovery.
We discovered it. And what we found was that they have leaf-like structures on their toes, with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug, and each of those hairs has the worst case of split-ends possible: about 100 to 1000 split ends that are nano-size.
More recently, this happened.
Lynn Verinsky: Ha! Wow. And what a privilege that has been.
And if you look, you can see that it uses the toe peeling, just like the gecko does.
They said, "Well, it kind of looks like a tail."
It can also act as a counterbalance.
And when I went back to research this, I realized that one of the great TED moments in the past, from Nathan, we've talked about an active tail.
So here is normal speed.
And what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf, and there was some wind, or we shook it?
And they do it with their tail.
There it is.
And it's better than that, it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air.
Stay tuned for that.
So now we were really confused, because there are no reports of it gliding.
So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.
That is, whether you care about security, search and rescue or health, we must preserve nature's designs, otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.
for me, it's ocean acidification.
You know, they were marginalized in the negotiation room.
Most of the science that is behind these numbers, these potential targets, is based on studies on land.
There's all kinds of natural causes of climate change.
So those are all natural causes of climate change.
And we've got it worked out, and we can say, "Yes, CO2 is causing the planet to warm up now."
It looks downright tropical there.
This is a crazy thing, this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket to keep everybody warm, drilling at temperatures of minus 40.
So we drill back in time to see how often that's happened, and exactly how fast that ice can melt.
We saw these alternations between sediments that look like this -- there's gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand.
So what that means is, what it tells us is that the Ross Sea region, this ice shelf, melted back and formed anew about 35 times.
that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted.
This is from Champion Island.
And what we found after drilling back in time two to 400 years was that these were unique events.
Now, Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral.
We're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well.
Now the reason we know it's 1584 is that these corals have growth bands.
In this example here, we had monitored this reef in Galapagos with temperature recorders, so we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in.
There's a whole family of curves here.
Some of the records show lower temperatures than others.
And there's the temperature up there in 2009.
That is what's happening right now, and it's a very different issue than the global warming issue.
But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected.
You have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when CO2 levels were double what they are today.
Well, then you'd be screwed because you'd know what to wish for and you'd used up your wish.
Wow! Some of you watched it.
And this is Donna teaching my aunt how to do a Filipino dance.
I'm the daughter of an American mother and an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father.
I taught English, and I met some incredible women there.
I looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs that were, you know, very pretty photographs and I was like, I failed at this.
And I was watching television in New York and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across, and the coverage went from the U.S. State Department to embedded troops and what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings, and the Iraqis would be greeting the Americans as liberators and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of Baghdad.
So I was thinking, you know, this station that's hated by so many people has to be doing something right.
I still have that dream.
It was absolutely revolting.
And it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't bothered as much the night before.
And when I showed the film in the Middle East, people wanted to meet Josh.
But you don't understand people's anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war, and how do we get out of this bubble?
If you kill, there's no difference between victim and occupier.
Anyway, I'd rather have Paradise in my head than live in this hell!
How, if Israel has no morals?
They said yes.
George: At first, I thought it was a strange idea.
Death unto apartheid!"
And that's what this is about.
I watched it and I'm just -- I'm blown away by it and its potential to bring voices from around the world, independent voices from around the world, and create a truly democratic, global television.
You know, we've been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the Great Pyramid and the Great Wall of China.
Now, we've thought about a name for this day and I'd like to share this with you.
And that's my wish.
That is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down, Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see.
All of that could be described using Newton's work.
But if there is matter in the environment, such as the Sun, it causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve.
It really works. It describes the data.
That raised a question: warps and curves in what?
Now clearly, Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously.
Let me show you that one visually.
So, if we take a look, say, at space itself -- I can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen.
Until something wonderful happened in our age.
So deep inside -- we all know, you go sufficiently far down, you have atoms.
And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns, these can also vibrate in different patterns.
And that's what we mean by a unified theory.
But it raises the question: are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions, or do they tell us something about the world?
This is a deep question.
But, as you can see, the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape, interesting structure.
So, if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like -- we don't yet, but if we did -- we should be able to calculate the allowed notes, the allowed vibrational patterns.
The hope is that if the collision has enough energy, it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions, forcing it to enter into the other dimensions.
So this is the kind of experiment that we'll be looking at in the next five, seven to 10 years or so.
I want to start with a game.
And how many people think it's the orange one?
So, for us, seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does.
Can anyone see it? Anyone? No?
So let me show you what I mean. Imagine that this is the back of your eye.
And yet it's only the retinal information that we get.
So, I'm going to give you some letter strings. And I want you to read them out for me, if you can.
Why? Because it wouldn't have been useful in the past.
But I really want you to learn.
That's your new normal.
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to review those two scenes.
If they are under the same light, reflecting the same amount of light to your eye, then they must be equally reflective.
The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray.
And suddenly it will flip, and start spinning the opposite direction.
Even the beautiful bumblebee, with its mere one million brain cells, which is 250 times fewer cells than you have in one retina, sees illusions, does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can't do.
Now, they are not born that way. Right?
And she'll come into the hive, find an empty honey pot and throw up, and that's honey.
Okay, this is complete rubbish.
On the left is what his camera sees.
So, working with kids, they created images, thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them.
We're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment -- by our ecology.
All right. Now you can see that changes the light that's coming through there. Right?
Do they look the same? No.
The first thing is that the big myth, number one, is that in fact it's not really a crime.
The same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table, it all takes place in the private sector.
You see, history's rich in irony.
They went right in here. I was a young man at the time.
Okay? Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted.
It was a constitutional outrage of the first order, and I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament.
It was kind of a nasty way to get maturation, but we got it, because we all understood it, and for the first time that I could remember, there were mass protests against this corruption.
The entire project cost about 1.6 billion dollars, Trinidad and Tobago dollars, and in fact, we had a lot of bid-rigging and suspicious activity, corrupt activity took place.
And there was a lady with a sign, a very simple sign, a kind of battered-looking blonde lady, and the sign was made out of Bristol board, as we say in these parts, and it was made with a marker.
What if this is just the first time that the so-and-sos had been caught?
In an unprecedented fit of generosity -- and you have to be very suspicious about these people -- in an unprecedented — and I'm using that word carefully — unprecedented fit of generosity, the government of the day signed, made a written commitment, to repay all of the creditors.
Listen. They've had bailouts on Wall Street.
So I started digging and writing and so and so on, and that work can be found, my personal work can be found at AfraRaymond.com, which is my name.
The Ministry of Finance, we are told, is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
What are the figures he's relying on?
There's a particular individual who is in the government now.
But you see, the question is this: If it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act and to use the court to force a disclosure about 60 million dollars in public money, it must be right and proper for us to force a disclosure about 24 billion dollars.
It's been ignored.
We will continue to work within JCC.
They have international branches, and it's important for us to tune into this one.
You could feel secure even if you're not.
And the question to ask when you look at a security anything is not whether this makes us safer, but whether it's worth the trade-off.
In politics also, there are different opinions.
That rabbit will make a security trade-off: "Should I stay, or should I flee?"
Certainly that's true for most of human prehistory.
The unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar.
So you can imagine how that works.
We respond to stories more than data.
And the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack, they get different.
And there are two ways to do this.
Okay, so what makes people not notice?
So let me complicate things.
You don't need a model.
Where do we get these models? We get them from others.
Because we had different models based on our different experiences.
So models can change.
And we're good at it.
So there was that feeling of lack of control.
We have feeling, model, reality.
In the history of the past 50 years, the smoking risk shows how a model changes, and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn't like.
If they equal your feelings, you don't even know you have a model.
But 80 years, we're just not good at.
So in the technological world, we don't have experience to judge models.
And that's okay.
I mean really though, information seems like our best hope.
It's a horrific story. Someone took a bottle of Tylenol, put poison in it, closed it up, put it back on the shelf.
I'll give you one, a syringe.
It basically never happens.
Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds.
And people like us want to do things that destroy plants, and their habitats.
So here is the building; it looks rather unassuming, really.
So first of all we did deals with 50 different countries.
You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off.
And that enables us to develop germination protocols.
These are not just crop plants, as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway -- fantastic work there.
How much does it cost?
Psychology professor took kids that were four years old and put them in a room all by themselves.
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes.
What did they find?
They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out.
This little girl was interesting; she ate the inside of the marshmallow.
If the sales person says, "Wait a second.
We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing.
And by 1980, the last train rode.
And what first attracted me, or interested me, was this view from the street -- which is this steel structure, sort of rusty, this industrial relic.
And it turns out, we got those numbers wrong.
We worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape.
There's a point, you can stand here and see buildings by Frank Gehry, Jean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban, Neil Denari.
And the city has planned -- for better or for worse -- 12 million square-feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around.
We who are diplomats, we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states.
You see the green is a traditional interstate conflict, the ones we used to read about.
And we, therefore, have a problem, because they escape traditional diplomacy.
Now I'm not naive.
The situation, to be honest, is very serious.
But then they need a different political process than the one they were given in 2001, 2002.
And that's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict -- because they talk.
This is Tahrir Square.
Because we never talk to the people in these countries.
Because they may turn out to be a majority.
So if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come, we will further radicalization, I believe.
Now as you know, Mandela didn't do that.
And what is dialogue really about?
And I believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy, not only between states, but also within states.
How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations, unless we are able to make civil society and people, not part of the problem, but part of the solution?
But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it.
Thank you for your attention.
So, I said, "No, no, really -- it's penguin shit."
It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do.
Because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations, and see where they succeeded and where they failed.
And, one thing that isn't a mystery, actually, was when I grew up -- because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures -- and I thought, "Well, why that look on the face?
The one on the page here is the same that's up there.
While I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also, so you get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet.
This is the conventional nuclear fuel cycle.
It's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return thing that we do.
But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field.
I used to work, also while at Microsoft, at a leading restaurant in Seattle, so I do a lot of cooking.
This subjects food to a force about 50,000 times that of normal gravity, and oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock.
In fact, almost everybody in the movie is based on a real character, a real person.
They said, "Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie?
I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs, which is the finding of them.
Now, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.
And this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex, which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago.
In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived, had much higher CO2 than today, was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of CO2 on climate.
Here's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas.
There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex.
And for a long time I fought this, and I thought, "Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down."
And that this, in fact, will be the way that we treat cancer in the future.
But it has its limitations.
So the list of ingredients does tell you something, and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong.
So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person by looking at their ingredients list.
So Mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing, and Darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing, and then Watson and Crick actually looked and found one.
There's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity.
And the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells -- actually, the machines that are operating -- that's where the action is.
People have tried very hard to do this.
He's like, "No, no. I really need it.
And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like.
And so each of these lines represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein.
And so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences.
The thing about cancer -- when I got into this, I really knew nothing about it, but working with David Agus, I started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out.
If you've got malaria, we give you quinine or some derivative of it.
And then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer, and we treat these as if they're separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong.
We might divide it -- the plumber would say, "Well, where's the water?"
Because normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time.
And we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model where we can understand, when cancer happens, what's actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer.
Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong.
Okay, so how exactly do we create this world-shattering, if you will, innovation?
Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"
And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives from various tribal councils that met, also known as Super Bowl parties, we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a USC game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people, you would in fact see not a single crowd, just like there is not a single crowd here, but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.
If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in and nudge them forward, along these tribal stages to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.
Stage One is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons.
They'll do whatever it takes to survive, even if that means undermining other people.
You find them in all places in society.
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move.
I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.
Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.
One of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird."
This is a scene or snippet from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.
Okay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.
In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.
He didn't say "We have a dream." He said, "I have a dream."
And those are the ones that change the world.
And you know what changed his life? It was walking into one of these, a Boys and Girls Club.
I want to argue that we're doing that right here.
The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of a place called the Gallup Organization.
They had people involved who were Nobel laureates in economics, who reported being bored.
You're hearing one presentation after another, often representing a group of people, a tribe, about how they have changed the world.
And the first story is called "The Faulty Switch."
This sound colors our first impression of any room; it can't be helped.
The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature.
Why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch?
A break of light and air, an architectural biding of time.
It was not until the 14th century that an Italian painter recognized the lap as a Grecian temple, upholstered in flesh and cloth.
We have fading memories of that provisional temple, erected each time an adult sat down.
The next story is called "The Haverpiece Collection" A nondescript warehouse, visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway, serves as the temporary resting place for the Haverpiece collection of European dried fruit.
Upon his death in 1967, a quarter of the items were sold off for compote to a high-class hotel restaurant.
Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story of giving a speech in Holland and, after the fact, the word "compassion" was translated as "pity."
And it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough.
To start simply, I want to say that compassion is kind.
Compassion can be synonymous with empathy.
And compassion does seek physicality.
I can't quite explain it, and he can't either.
But again and again, lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness.
And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen, who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her, that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces.
This is going to change science, I believe, and it will change religion.
He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages.
And when I look at the second, I ask, what kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?"
Our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems.
So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing and say that humanity, the future of humanity, needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race.
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol.
But the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase, the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me, "Why are you being so mellow?" -- mellow, of course, being the exact opposite of R-O-W-D-I-E.
But for years I denied this intuition, and so I became a Wall Street lawyer, of all things, instead of the writer that I had always longed to be -- partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too.
We all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing.
Our most important institutions, our schools and our workplaces, they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation.
Okay, same thing is true in our workplaces.
Now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts.
We need more of a yin and yang between these two types.
And in fact, we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude.
You might be following the person with the best ideas, but you might not.
And if you look at the self-help books from this era, they all had titles with things like "Character, the Grandest Thing in the World."
And they feature as their role models really great salesmen.
Books.
Just like the rest of my family, my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read.
So I just published a book about introversion, and it took me about seven years to write.
But I'll tell you, what helps even more is my sense, my belief, my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude, we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change.
But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work.
So extroverts, maybe your suitcases are also full of books.
You know, one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that I'm really here by accident.
So, with that in mind, first of all let me tell you, I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest, the other four are women.
He explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world.
And the second thing they said: and we trust you, that no matter where you are or where you go, you will always do the right thing.
Although frankly speaking, we don't believe the Internet is the killer app.
We always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with governments, industry, educational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors.
As a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very doable, even before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries, such as India and China, the progress has been good -- has been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed, places like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world, the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact, I was just recently visiting South Africa.
It is actually a business venture.
It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same.
In other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions.
And to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system, it could only be done from inside.
We have now deployed 30 different technologists in 18 different countries, and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands.
The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part, and battery life on this product is now 15 hours -- just through a lot of innovative work people have done because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this.
And one of the things that I learned, too, from my parents -- and I'll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father.
Because I knew what a great husband he was, and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me, like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child, my first child, and again, my father comes to the hospital, and we're looking at the glass, and see all the children on the other side, and he said, "I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better, you're going to have to be a better father than I was."
And I'm often asked, why do you think so many people have read this?
Your parents may not have planned you, but I believe God did.
Why do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am?"
There are people -- a lady came up to me the other day, and she had a white piece of paper -- Michael, you'll like this one -- and she said, "What do you see in it?"
When you write the best-selling book in the world, it's tons and tons of money -- and it brought in a lot of attention, neither of which I wanted.
But everybody's got -- and I believe in a pluralistic society -- everybody's betting on something.
So I believe, essentially, that leadership is stewardship.
And he said, "No."
And you are responsible -- that's my worldview.
What we believe, obviously -- and you know this -- determines our behavior, and our behavior determines what we become in life.
Third thing is, I added up all that the church had paid me over the last 25 years, and I gave it back.
And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals, it makes a difference.
Materialism is all about getting -- get, get, get, get all you can, can all you get, sit on the can and spoil the rest.
Giving your life away.
The hard part is, what do I do with all this attention?
He says, "I want you to make me famous.
And as I read that, I looked at it, and I thought, you know, what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence.
And I could go five years and never, ever see a homeless person.
What's in your hand?
Number one, God never does a miracle to show off.
Obviously, if He's God, then that would mean that when He asks the question, it's for your benefit, not His.
In those days nobody had bank accounts, or American Express cards, or hedge funds.
What's in your hand?"
You're making a lot of money off that little ball.
That, to me, is the primary question about life.
If you're wired to make deals, you make deals.
He made you. And when you do what you were made to do, He goes, "That's my boy.
The importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the FARC, the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement.
In Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops.
And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years.
Her mother had not gone to primary school.
Sometimes school is under a tree, or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education, so you need a collaborative model of learning, not just building more schools and training more teachers, which you have to do anyway.
You don't vaccinate a few children.
She just stares at me for a few moments, and then she cracks up, because she figures out what I'm talking about.
The human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine.
And finally, I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so, it is the single greatest moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.
I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory, it can actually be quite funny, like my stupid Chinese character mistake.
When we're wrong about something -- not when we realize it, but before that -- we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.
You're sitting there in class, and your teacher is handing back quiz papers, and one of them looks like this.
Okay, so fine.
She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing -- stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.
So this is a huge practical problem.
They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.
To me, this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity.
And the crypto-theme is: 'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.' And the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.
And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life, until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.
We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements, but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements?
The theme of this one, as you guys have now heard seven million times, is the rediscovery of wonder.
Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it, as opposed to where the rivers flood. You start getting this organic agriculture; you start putting machinery onto this stuff. Machinery, with a whole bunch of water, leads to very large-scale agriculture.
The effect of this, of course, is it's not just amber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.
These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest trucks in the world are working here, and then you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to separate it, which only works at today's oil prices.
This is called coal bed methane. Why is this picture interesting? Because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life, the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up -- may be because there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.
What is this? This is the first transplant of naked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating system out of one cell, insert it into a different cell, and have that cell boot up as a separate species. That's one month old. You will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff.
The oil price goes through the floor. That company goes out of business, and then you can bring the oil price back up.
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.
So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.
Well, not exactly, of course not.
That's where I got reacquainted with Abraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs."
It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.
Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.
So here's another Einstein quote: "Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted."
The king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later.
So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement, I got to really understand what they're doing.
One of those key indicators is: How do the Bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day?
The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill, constantly focused on what they don't have.
Could this little country, like a startup in a mature industry, be the spark plug that influences a 21st century of middle-class in China and India?
This is a collection of things that Robert Kennedy said in that quote.
Why in the heck in America are we doing a census in 2010?
We're not asking anything that's intangible.
And only 36 percent is in the tangible industries of manufacturing and agriculture.
This is Dave Arringdale who's actually been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.
We count on people.
Okay, one, two, three.Audience: Can you read this?
It's because perception is grounded in our experience.
But actually, it's a tremendous problem, because how can we ever see differently?
The question "why?" is one of the most dangerous things you can do, because it takes you into uncertainty.
Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun.
Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently, but, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right?
Now she is the personification of courage, because she's going to stand up here and talk to you all.
BL: So the next step was to design an experiment, which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed this experiment, and so -- well, game -- and so, Amy, can you tell us what the game was, and the puzzle that you set the bees?
So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it, but the next step is observation. So here are some of the students doing the observations. They're recording the data of where the bees fly.
And now we want to share. That's the next step.
So the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative, which means that this paper is written in kidspeak.
So we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves, who is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world, and he says, "This is the most original science paper I have ever read" — — "and it certainly deserves wide exposure."
What was the feedback like?
Curiosity, interest, innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science.
Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself.
Where's the sound coming from?
But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy. Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle, I then realized that science isn't just a boring subject, and that anyone can discover something new.
It's going to destroy the living systems there.
The other thing that we don't often appreciate is it's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer.
Well, the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices.
You put yours in the white bin."
"You've served so well."
It's just awful, those poor people.
We're back where we were in the 1970s.
And we don't have disposable people either.
But if we want to make something hard, we come up, "I know, I'm going to make a hard substance.
I don't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff.
We're so proud to live here in California.
And I would say that we live in a country -- five percent of the world's population, 25 percent of the greenhouse gases, but also 25 percent of the world's prisoners.
Most of you are good, softhearted people.
Many of you could ask the question, you know, why is a flying car, or maybe more accurately, a roadable aircraft, possible at this time?
I thought, what a great way to get to school.
The press calls my particular volantor a "Skycar."
In a helicopter you feel -- and it's still a remarkable sensation -- you feel like you're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane.
It's bad enough on a highway, what's it going to be like to be in the air?
However, the next 10 years, if like the last 10 years, we're going to see 30 percent more traffic.
And so, in effect, you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed is concerned.
You'd motor, electrically, to a vertiport, which may be a few blocks, maybe even a few miles away.
We flew the first vehicle for the international press in 1965, when I really got it started.
A vertical-takeoff aircraft is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program.
A vertical-takeoff aircraft, like the hummingbird, has a very high metabolism, which means it requires a lot of energy.
We actually get 175 horsepower into one cubic foot.
If you stick around, then good luck.
that's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco.
Twenty-three percent said, "As soon as it's proven safe."
Built the Tesla coil. This tower was built on Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s.
We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States."
This is what happens.
It got about 50 percent of the efficiency -- by the way, that's still a couple thousand times more efficient than a battery would be, to do the same thing.
What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology, which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room.
You know. What about safety?
Then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere that will regulate everything we do.
Imagine driving into your garage -- we've built a system to do this -- you drive into your garage, and the car charges itself, because there is a mat on the floor that's plugged into the wall.
By the way, I do make it look a little bit easier than it is.
It causes one to be created out here.
And I'll do it again, just for safety's sake.
It's odd. It has a battery.
You'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back, to do that, and it probably beeps, actually, as it goes on as well.
So, thank you very much.
The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.
If you're cremated, all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere.
The Infinity Burial Project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the Infinity Mushroom -- a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies, clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots, leaving clean compost.
Just a little.
Once it's completed, I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects.
What I've learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment.
So I'd like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in China, the night I met my husband.
"I don't understand. Soybeans?
And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be.
It turned out to be a rare, exceedingly aggressive type, with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most.
It makes him so sick, he has to quit it, yet still he lives on.
They're going to attack the cancer in new ways.
Perhaps there's still hope ahead.
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care, and of healthcare for all of us.
Well, one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper, the advance directive, to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.
I believed I could keep him from dying, and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way.
How can they insist on this treatment at the end?
Just days before Terence died, his oncologist said, "Tell Terence that better days are just ahead."
So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night, and I believed it.
As a result, he spent just four days in hospice, which I'm sure, as you all know, is a pretty typical outcome, and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end.
And he's been a pretty good general.
That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life, a goodbye for a man for whom anything, well, almost anything, was possible, a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.
What I want to talk to you about today is virtual worlds, digital globes, the 3-D Web, the Metaverse.
We want to navigate, explore, discover information.
Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes, from ground vehicles, from people.
We sit here -- you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale -- what do you see in person? We need to capture that up close to establish that what it's like-type experience.
We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors, disaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue.
Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they'd have to do it manually.
What we're doing is -- people like this a lot, this bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data.
What we're trying to do is build a virtual world.
That is to say, microalgae contributes between 2,000 and 5,000 gallons per acre per year, compared to the 50 gallons per acre per year from soy.
So let's envision what the system might look like.
It leaks. It's struck by lightning.
We also set up experiments in San Francisco at one of the three waste water treatment plants, again a facility to test ideas.
But this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag.
Well, we found of course that this material became overgrown with algae, and we needed then to develop a cleaning procedure, and we also looked at how seabirds and marine mammals interacted, and in fact you see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting, and would periodically work its way across this little floating water bed, and we wanted to hire this guy or train him to be able to clean the surface of these things, but that's for the future.
So let me tell you that it's not going to be easy, and there's lots more work to do in all four of those areas to be able to really make the system work.
Where are we going to put this, and what will it look like offshore?
So what I'm telling you about is a system of integrated activities.
Can this project continue to move forward within NASA or do you need some very ambitious green energy fund to come and take it by the throat?
And the question I want to explore with you is whether or not democracy has helped or has hindered economic growth.
Look at the skyline of Shanghai.
This is an Oxford-trained economist steeped in humanistic values, and yet he agrees with the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai.
If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth, then you would argue a strong government is necessary to promote growth.
And Country 2 is possibly India."
If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union other than the fact about their telephones, you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades.
In fact, if you look at the evidence worldwide, the evidence is more supportive of the view that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth.
If I were to ask you, "Which are the two Asian countries?
By that comparison, democracy looks very, very good in terms of economic growth.
For each of these successful authoritarian governments in East Asia, there's a matched failure.
The question there is: Which country did better, China or India?
The adult literacy rate in China is 77 percent as compared with 48 percent in India.
On average, as a Chinese in 1965, you lived 10 years more than an average Indian.
The good news is, by 2006, India has closed the gap between men and women in terms of life expectancy.
If you look at other East Asian countries, women there play a hugely important role in terms of economic take-off -- in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle associated with East Asia.
Dynamically, it has changed over time to become less authoritarian and more democratic.
And my own view is the country is going to face some substantial challenges, because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms.
One reason is they are always comparing India with China.
China, I believe, still has some of the excellent raw fundamentals -- mostly the social capital, the public health, the sense of egalitarianism that you don't find in India.
Hopefully, five years from now, I'm going to report to TEDGlobal that political reforms will happen in China.
You would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch, a little gin -- particularly around 1650 -- and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day.
This was their conjugal bed, in a sense -- ideas would get together there.
We have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration.
So the metaphor I'd like the use I can take from a story of a great idea that's quite recent -- a lot more recent than the 1650s.
And what they noticed was they don't have a lot of DVRs, they don't have a lot of microwaves, but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road.
And so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota and the ability to fix a headlight, and you can repair this thing.
You know, you're sitting there thinking a deep thought, and the apple falls from the tree, and you have the theory of gravity.
So when they were sitting in front of the microscope, when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler, and all these things.
They want to say, "There I was, I was standing there and I had it all suddenly clear in my head."
That's in his autobiography.
It will be useful in 2020.
It's October of 1957, and Sputnik has just launched, and we're in Laurel Maryland, at the applied physics lab associated with Johns Hopkins University.
And so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues, and everybody's like, "No, I hadn't thought of doing that.
We may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this.
And eventually, they get permission -- this is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description.
And they came back and said, "Actually, it'll be easier."
And I bet you one of you, if not more, has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last -- in the last day or last week, right?
We are living in an age of surging income inequality, particularly between those at the very top and everyone else.
today account for more than eight percent of the national income.
So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy, but we've been slow to notice it.
What's driving it, and what can we do about it?
But if crony capitalism is, intellectually at least, the easy part of the problem, things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality.
It's easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields, like sports and entertainment.
And that's because, in contrast with crony capitalism, so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive.
One of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy can become crony plutocracy.
Again, this is no mere hypothetical.
The plutocracy may be a meritocracy, but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race.
The terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity.
After all, for all its grim, satanic mills, it worked out pretty well, didn't it?
Today, we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the Industrial Revolution.
While I give this talk, in the next 10 minutes, a hundred million of my cells will die, and over the course of today, 2,000 of my brain cells will die and never come back, so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece.
Certainly, a lot of the technologies that we use have got something to do with that.
I was called down to the ward to see him.
He's very, very thin, and he is, indeed, very sick with pneumonia, and he's too sick to talk to me, so I talk to his daughter Kathleen, and I say to her, "Did you and Jim ever talk about what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation?"
And only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do if they became seriously ill.
How we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us, and the stress created in families by dying is enormous, and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else, so dying in intensive care is not your top option if you've got a choice.
It's quite likely in an audience this size this won't happen to anybody here.
Enjoying it so far?
But we realized, of course, that we are dealing with cultural issues, and this is, I love this Klimt painting, because the more you look at it, the more you kind of get the whole issue that's going on here, which is clearly the separation of death from the living, and the fear — Like, if you actually look, there's one woman there who has her eyes open.
Ninety-eight percent of people really thought this just should have been normal practice, and that this is how things should work.
And this is the small idea.
The big idea, I think, is more political.
Now, listen, that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia.
This is a quote from Dame Cicely Saunders, whom I met when I was a medical student.
And she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split.
I found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old.
I was 14, and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded.
And being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought, "Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's which is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound -- purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth."
But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time, so how did the good and bad go together?
Because what stem cells are -- they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue.
We're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix.
And what metastases are is when the tumor -- when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is.
Meaning that you have muscle cells, but they're not dividing, so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack.
Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels.
Therefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue, it can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.
I mean, there are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle.
If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way, cancer occurred -- I mean, everybody would have cancer almost.
I used to be a photographer for many years.
And the grandmother had never let any Westerners ever see her.
The family had a small shed on the side of the house, so I said, "Could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings?"
The way they heat their homes in Korea is to put bricks under the floors, so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor.
This is the first morning I stayed with her.
And so, she really just completely ignored me most of the time.
And I would stand at attention, and all the girls would crack up, and it was sort of a little joke.
I mean I had fallen in love with this girl, but I -- you know, it was, like, emotionally I was about 12 years old.
And I immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in Atlanta, Georgia, who had an 11-year-old son.
I figured I'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother.
So I finally found Myung Sung, her best friend that she used to play with after school every day.
And I said, "Well, tell him that I am a photographer."
And I had this whole mental picture of, sort of like Cinderella.
Would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow?
They were yelling at him, they were -- it got to be really ugly.
I said, "All I know is, I've been photographing a lot of these children."
And the pictures before were taken in September.
Now, I had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this, because the grandmother, to me, appeared to be sort of the village wise woman, and the person everybody -- throughout the day, I noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother.
And he said, "The second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids.
Gene and Gail started studying Korean the moment they had gotten my first letter.
Now, we went out to dinner that night to celebrate.
And Gene and I looked at each other and said, "No, we don't want two 11-year-olds five floors away."
And then, at night, about midnight, they turn the heat off in the hotel.
So, we're trying to get Natasha up, and we can't talk to her.
We're all choking, and there's smoke pouring through the vents, under the doors. There's people screaming.
And Gene, who's lying on the floor, says, "Man, we've got to soak towels." I said, "What?"
So, we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall, we put blankets at the bottom of the door, we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air.
In any case, 12 hours later, I mean, they put us in the lobby.
So it turned into a dual celebration, because Natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the United States.
This is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage.
Just to make things even crazier, Gail, Natasha's new mom, was three days away from giving birth to her own daughter.
She entered seventh grade at her own age level.
She's being baptized.
Used to do their Christmas card every year.
This is Natasha's wedding day.
Rick Smolan: I'm sure there's about 40 things she's going to tell me, "That wasn't what happened, that wasn't what you said."
Now that was, ironically, and very befittingly, the way we found his grave.
But there was no evidence.
It's a new telescope.
All the stars for Kepler are just points of light.
So we count many, many such planets, and they have different sizes.
But up until, literally, 15 years ago, that was all we knew about planets.
We didn't have any evidence whether planets like the Earth are out there.
In the next few years we will confirm them.
It's about 100 million such planets.
The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next.
And so, that's what we are trying to do.
And in a sense, you can think of that work that people are starting to do now around the world as building a bridge, building a bridge from two sides of the river.
This understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives.
And look at this image of the tiny, blue dot.
And let's compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms.
It will be the size of a single, small atom.
This is very significant.
And let's do it.
And the size of these bubbles, the size of the bubbles here, that shows how many are infected in each country, and the color is the continent.
I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer.
In the last two to three years, we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.
And if people who are infected are treated, they don't die of AIDS.
Drugs is too costly -- had we had the vaccine, or when we will get the vaccine, that's something more effective -- but the drugs are very costly for the poor.
I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States.
So, is it poverty?
Look here at Kenya.
I will swap the bubbles to a map.
But, there is one part of Africa -- and the difficult thing is, at the same time, not to make a uniform statement about Africa, not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this, on one hand.
But what we think is that it could be concurrency.
HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore, having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others.
We know that about 106 billion people have ever lived.
Economic historians call this "The Great Divergence."
When you get to the 1970s, which is where this chart ends, the average Briton is more than 10 times richer than the average Indian.
Now you can't just blame this on imperialism -- though many people have tried to do so -- for two reasons.
The same wind that carries them back would bring us thither?"
Within an incredibly short period of time, people living in the German Democratic Republic produced Trabants, the Trabbi, one of the world's worst ever cars, while people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz.
And I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED.
And he said it such a long time ago.
There are six which I think explain the Great Divergence.
Competition means, not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500, but within each of these units, there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns.
The Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe, but there's no scientific revolution there.
And you can see here the huge divergence that happens in property ownership between North and South.
The empires weren't all bad.
Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant.
At the top of the international league table according to the latest PISA study, is the Shanghai district of China.
It's open source.
The second question is, does the sequencing of the download matter?
But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt.
That's not the way the West rose, and I don't think it's the way the West will fall.
Niall Ferguson: Well I really am not just talking about the rise of the East; I'm talking about the rise of the Rest, and that includes South America.
The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow.
Niall, thank you.
Spiders are not just everywhere, but they're extremely diverse.
Most spiders use copious amounts of silk, and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction.
How does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk?
So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect an orb-web-weaving spider, and I hope you do, what you would find is a bounty of beautiful, translucent silk glands.
And the most studied silk line of them all: major ampullate silk.
So what you're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored in the glycines with green, and the alanines in red, and so you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's.
What silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences, these amino acid sequences, to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers.
In fact, this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length.
This is an area that's largely unexplored but here's a little bit of data I can show you.
In fact, the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region, a non orb-web-weaving spider.
It's the combination of strength, extensibility and toughness that makes spider silk so special, and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists, so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions.
You'll be seeing one of the most high-performance materials known to man.
It can be for profit or not profit. It can be large or small.
Young and old, dancing in the streets.
Tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification.
The classic answer is to form an institution, right?
And that creates additional costs.
When you build cooperation into the infrastructure, which is the Flickr answer, you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals, rather than moving the individuals to the problem.
That is a point-to-point replacement of coordination with planning.
And worst of all, that figure at the bottom, approximately ten photos per photographer, is a lie.
This is called a power-law distribution.
If you go down to five percent, you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos.
And the 80 percent zone is a no-carrot and no-stick zone.
We have over here Psycho Milt, a Flickr user, who has contributed one, and only one, photo titled "Iraq."
One of the first things that happens when you institutionalize a problem is that the first goal of the institution immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was to self-preservation.
The bigger question is, what do you do about the value down here?
The Psycho Milt question is, was it a good idea?
Number one group on Meetup right now, most chapters in most cities with most members, most active?
And I use that word advisedly.
Want to publish globally anything you think today?
So as much as we want the shield laws, the background -- the institution to which they were attached -- is becoming incoherent.
We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial.
It was produced by analyzing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week.
And so the point here is not, "This is wonderful," or "We're going to see a transition from only institutions to only cooperative framework."
Well, in this technique, what I've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world, the artisan bread-baking community, has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so -- since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America -- and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole-grain breads.
It's got germ. Those are the good things, but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat.
It's hydrated dough we call "the soaker" -- that helps to start enzyme activity.
And on day two, we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy.
Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them.
And somehow, this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food, and we're going to explore that in a minute.
It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan, but we pan it.
They give us that beautiful brown crust.
Again, transformed in stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage 11 as bread.
In fact, Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level, so that's why we're talking literally about bread.
I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know?
It's not only been killed, but it's been denied any potential for creating future life.
So, we've got now this flour.
You see, the baker, in this moment, has become, in a sense, sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well, while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.
So all these things are determined by the baker, and the bread goes through some stages, and characters develop.
The yeast, whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough, to enliven it, to vivify it, in order to complete its mission, which is also to turn this dough into bread, has to give up its life.
It's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life.
But we've got this bread, and what I did here is to try to, again, evoke even more flavor from this grain, was we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making.
I'll leave you with what I call the baker's blessing.
Okay, I wrote that.
So here we have this piece of music by Beethoven, and my problem with it is, it's boring.
It gets a little bit boring, and so pretty soon I go through other instruments, they become familiar, and eventually I find myself designing and constructing my own instrument, and I brought one with me today, and I thought I would play a little bit on it for you so you can hear what it sounds like.
So this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world of this instrument, which I think is quite interesting and it puts me in the role of the inventor, and the nice thing about — This instrument is called the Mouseketeer ...
Anyway, but I guess my point is that all of these enterprises are engaging to me in their multiplicity, but as I've presented them to you today, they're actually solitary enterprises, and so pretty soon I want to commune with other people, and so I'm delighted that in fact I get to compose works for them.
Let's zoom in on one section of it right here. You can see it's rather detailed. I do all of this with drafting templates, with straight edges, with French curves, and by freehand, and the 72 feet was actually split into 12 six-foot-wide panels that were installed around the Cantor Arts Center Museum lobby balcony, and it appeared for one year in the museum, and during that year, it was experienced as visual art most of the week, except, as you can see in these pictures, on Fridays, from noon til one, and only during that time, various performers came and interpreted these strange and undefined pictographic glyphs.
I took the Copenhagen subway map and I renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations, and the players, who are synchronized with stopwatches, follow the timetables, which are listed in minutes past the hour.
Another role that I like to take on is that of the performance artist.
So, yeah, I get it, with, like, the weird appliances and then the total absence of conventional instruments and this glut of conductors, people might, you know, wonder, yeah, "Is this music?"
I was playing nice. I had to write the orchestra bits, right?
Is it music? Here's how I want to conclude.
In the last 20 years, developmental science has completely overturned that picture.
Babies, after all, can't talk, and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks, what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that.
I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm."
But then after they stared for a long time, they would just give her the crackers, what they thought everybody must like.
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially, they seem pretty useless.
On the other hand, we have our friend the domestic chicken.
Well some animals, like the chicken, seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well.
All right, why would we see this correlation?
So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species.
And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize, describe, the way that scientists find out about the world.
This is Reverend Bayes's notebook.
If I showed you this detector, you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector.
The first one is, again, remember, these are four year-olds.
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.
I don't know.
Boy: Oh, because the light goes only to here, not here.
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds.
Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid, and everything else sort of goes dark.
So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention, what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.
Now it's good to be a grownup.
Now, before I talk more about that technology, let's have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games.
The reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters.
Now, the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body.
Now, we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University, and we tried to start very simply.
For that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms.
When we started this, I set up the simulation one evening.
Now, after five generations of applying evolutionary process, the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better.
And again, if you move the obstacle a tiny bit, it'll again fall differently.
So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing, and tried to make it as realistic as possible.
But what it will do -- I'm going to push it again.
What you see is it takes steps backwards, it tries to counter-balance, it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land.
This is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on.
Now, just a fun thing: what happens if you put that character -- this is now a wooden version of it, but it's got the same AI in it -- but if you put that character on a slippery surface, like ice.
So, they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman and that's what we've been working on for the past few months.
Now, here's another one.
So if you look at the character carefully, you see there are lots of body movements going on, none of which you have to animate like in the old days.
It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach.
Yes, you can just about see it here.
We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations.
Probably starting with sports games, which are going to become much more interactive.
That's one project we're particularly excited about, and that's going to start next month.
So, you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter-balance.
So, that all happened automatically. We didn't put that in there.
Thank you.
You can burst bubbles.
Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.
We all had to fast during Ramadan.
He's like, "Huh!"
You have to separate fact from bias, right.
You know, I can't promise my child a life without bias -- we're all biased -- but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives.
It's not enough your software crashed my Mac and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my ROMS! Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence.
And you'll get paid for it. You can think about it, if you want.
One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support, and within 12 hours there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website, from users saying, "Me too!" and, "Here's my tale of woe." I call it "software rage."
You couldn't put the Mac OS 10 logo in 211k!
With your voices on it!
But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now? In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller.
I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox -- which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it.
They don't need the database and the website, but they're like, "Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday."
I'm telling you, it's there!
Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps.
But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that?
Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer.
He said, "I'm a tap counter."
Audience: Go on.
Every software company is doing Microsoft's R&amp;D.
But actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts.
People are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes.
The truth is, I never left you.
Other products cost less. Other products had more features.
When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer?
Here we go. Whoa! It's magnetic. It doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.
And conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- I say, "Piss off."
It could be the design of the thing you're using.
What technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty?
We organized into cities. We had many people.
So that this is possible to do this is not deniable.
We get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal.
And I walked down the middle, up to the train station, and everything below 14th Street was closed.
So we can't fight the thing with a million-to-one cost, one-to-a-million cost-benefit ratio.
Another factor of, say, six in dimensional reduction, which should give us about another factor of 100 in raw improvement in what the chips can do. And so, to put that in practical terms, if something costs about 1,000 dollars today, say, the best personal computer you can buy, that might be its cost, I think we can have that in 2020 for 10 dollars. Okay?
It's great that we have initiatives to say, let's go create the education and educate people in the world, because that's a great force for peace.
But these new materials bring such incredible innovations that there's a strong basis for hope that these things will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market.
If you shine a light on them, they produce electricity.
And so we begin to see, and we've seen business plans already, where the kind of things Lisa Randall's talking about are in there.
We believe that Genentech, the Compaq, the Lotus, the Sun, the Netscape, the Amazon, the Google in these fields are yet to be found, because this materials revolution will drive these things forward.
We've discovered with AIDS we need cocktails to work well so that the viral resistance -- we need several anti-virals.
You normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains.
And for example, some things we could do that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be -- use markets.
The law requires accountability.
But above all, what we have to do is we have to help the good guys, the people on the defensive side, have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things.
So I have a really cool day job-- I get to do some really amazing stuff.
Notably Mars, as a first example.
The next element is the fact that I have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life.
But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet with external eyes, not just as our home.
I think, myself, that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time.
And even that was considered outrageous at the time.
So, with all of these things put together, I think that the chances of life are much greater than I would've ever thought.
So, we know that it's probably quite cryptic.
Is it virus-sized? Is it smaller than that?
This is my favorite game on airplanes: where you're in an airplane and you look out the window, you see the horizon.
So, it's a very hazardous environment, with CO as well, and many other gases.
This stuff looks like what comes out of your two-year-old's nose when he has a cold.
In this cave, great areas are covered by this reddish material that you see here, and also these enormous crystals of selenite that you can see dangling down.
So, these are signals that they leave in the rock record.
We know that on Mars and the Moon there are tons of these structures.
We face the problem of, how can we do this robotically?
I'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT, and we have come up with the idea of having little, jumping bean-like robots that are propelled by artificial muscle, which is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties -- are the EPAMs, or artificial muscles.
And perhaps it's time we started to explore those, in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration.
Did life start here and was it transported there?
Imagine their congratulations and their high image of you.
And then, because you felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary.
Now, those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes, on average, and when asked afterwards, said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal.
They survive because medieval scribes copied them and copied them and copied them.
Because this book is actually a prayer book.
And with just a magnifying glass, he transcribed as much of the text as he could.
But it's not in an institution, it was bought by a private owner in 1998.
And they came from all sorts of different backgrounds.
It's polyvinyl acetate emulsion that doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry.
And normally in a book, you wouldn't worry about the little bits, but these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text.
And the image on the left is the normal red image.
You zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in, and you can just read it now.
And as it disappears, an electron from a shell farther out jumps in and takes its place.
Electrons go around one way, positrons go around the other.
So what did we discover?
It's 17,152 divided into 536 families.
Alexander the Great went on to conquer the known world; Hyperides found himself on trial for treason.
So this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity, speaking to us, not from the grave, because his grave doesn't exist, but from the Athenian law courts.
He did this because he understands data as well as books.
It's going to be built by users, by people who get this data together, by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from, all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from, people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things.
There are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution.
Why don't we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty and the cultural significance of the Internet.
In 1985, he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery.
I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world, must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world.
And it arrived, and it was tiny.
White truffles.
And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that, you know, their purpose had been served, and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me.
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.
I don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment should be the test of something's value, but I think in the case of a fashion item, an article of clothing, that's a reasonable benchmark.
I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.
The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say that he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them, so ...
There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it.
There's an air jet that dries you.
To try this one, the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the Manhattan showroom.
And it was really amazing.
There was one object that I could not get my hands on, and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc.
So, I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these.
And you know, it had this fragrant softness, and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.
And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech.
And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things by looking at how we do this.
Earlier this year, a virtual asteroid in it sold for 330,000 real dollars.
And specifically, it's in terms of the very intense emotional rewards that playing games offers to people both individually and collectively.
It gives you great powers.
And this allows something very special to happen in games.
I don't know what's inside them until I open them.
It keeps people engaged.
In most adventure games, it's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience.
So all this is very powerful.
Keep you engaged. Look at what people do -- adjust the world to match their expectation.
It's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States, among other places.
Every time you do something, you get credit; you get a credit for trying.
And fifth, the element of uncertainty.
And what this means is we can predict learning, we can predict enhanced engagement, these windows, these windows of time, in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level.
But the biggest neurological turn-on for people is other people.
They tracked these on a separate website.
And I just look at this, and I think, yes, we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets, by using elements of uncertainty, by using these multiple targets, by using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system, by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets to collaborate and compete, to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see.
But again, those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal, to take the data, to take the observations, of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement.
And I got from global security policy to food because I realized when I'm hungry, I'm really pissed off, and I'm assuming that the rest of the world is too.
But each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid.
All this time you're -- when you think about hunger, it's a hard thing to think about, because what we think about is eating.
Unfortunately, obesity's not only an American problem.
It's very consolidated, and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat.
And their farms are also large.
It's crazy.
And instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate, it's really important to look at them as one system.
I'm not the only one who's obsessed with this whole 30-year thing.
We all tend to think that these systems are quite different, and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world, but if we take a 30-year view, there's more hope in collaborative ideas.
The 30Project.org is launched, and I've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start.
Now, I think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today.
And we announced, "Hey, architecture, it's over here, in this autonomous language we're going to seed control of processes."
Now, if we do this, I believe we can go back 50 years and start reinjecting agency, social engineering, back into architecture.
And then only after this is done are you allowed to do this, begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions.
And we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right?
And that's a project that is just about to open next week, the new home for the Dallas Theater Center, the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre.
Well, that's exciting.
So, they stopped having inexpensive labor.
And because that flytower has the ability to pick up all the pristine elements, suddenly the rest of the environment can be provisional. And you can drill, cut, nail, screw paint and replace, with a minimum of cost.
That's a lot for a client to commit to before you actually see the fruition of the concept.
You're going down into our lobby, go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits, whether you like them or not, up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium.
This is the flat floor configuration.
And there it is in the thrust configuration.
The second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house.
Actually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds that are integrated into the windows themselves, again with failsafe mechanisms that can be lifted such that you can completely demystify, if you chose, the operations of the theater going on behind, rehearsals and so forth.
You can bring large objects into the chamber itself.
The theater has been going through its kind of paces.
This is the first time that actually the changeover was done and so there is literally thousands of people because everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it.
And last but not least the entire AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center.
Anyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories.
And, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years, I started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts, but also the artifacts of other people.
And that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives.
These dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's feelings from the last few hours, each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.
"I feel good."
So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from "We Feel Fine."
"I feel sassy."
Last May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost settlement in the United States, with a family of Inupiat Eskimos, documenting their annual spring whale hunt.
When I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.
They have time. When did it take place? Dates -- when did it occur?
So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.
And any of these can be clicked, and then the narrative is entered at that position.
This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.
This is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.
So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.
So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.
If you knew what Paro looked like, you'd understand how amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there.
He wanted to live a long life at the monastery.
A 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break.
He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho and started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face.
A 75-year-old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road.
I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way -- with amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter -- that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into on the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from.
JH: Are you hoping to?
So thank you again, so much.
You can start to see some familiar balloons here.
I get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilant when I get on the subway.
And at that moment, when I heard that, I just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night when I had been getting a ride in an ambulance from the sidewalk where I had been stabbed to the trauma room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, and what had happened was a gang had come in from Brooklyn.
They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def, and George Lucas did all the sound effects.
It was that enveloping, and there was only one spot that didn't hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, and it was my instep, and he was holding the arch of my foot and rubbing the instep with his thumb.
Like, now you can do whatever you want, like, you gotta get on with that.
We always hear that texting is a scourge.
So first there's speech, and then writing comes along as a kind of artifice.
That's what speech is like.
The Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event.
On a manual typewriter it was very difficult, and even when we had electric typewriters, or then computer keyboards, the fact is that even if you can type easily enough to keep up with the pace of speech, more or less, you have to have somebody who can receive your message quickly.
We see this general bagginess of the structure, the lack of concern with rules and the way that we're used to learning on the blackboard, and so we think that something has gone wrong.
It's evolved into something that is much subtler.
Very funny people, if that's what LOL means.
If you listen to the way black youth today speak, think about the use of the word "yo."
So for example, this Sally person says, "So I need to find people to chill with" and Jake says, "Haha" -- you could write a dissertation about "Haha" too, but we don't have time for that — "Haha so you're going by yourself? Why?"
All spoken languages have what a linguist calls a new information marker -- or two, or three.
It's the President of Harvard. It's 1871.
And so, the way I'm thinking of texting these days is that what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing that young people are developing, which they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills, and that means that they're able to do two things.
Often they would have no idea what half of it meant because a whole new language has developed among our young people doing something as mundane as what it looks like to us when they're batting around on their little devices.
And I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression.
And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica; we repeated it in England.
And with that, I think I should give up the stage, so, thank you so much.
We faced Rwanda; we faced Bosnia, and then we rediscovered our confidence.
So, as the president now reassures us, we are on track to achieve our goals.
And even if I'm wrong about those two things, even if they were able to take back the country, even if they were to invite back Al-Qaeda, it's extremely unlikely that Al-Qaeda would significantly enhance its ability to harm the United States or harm Europe.
Within a few months, there were two and a half million more girls in school.
It's not simply corruption and waste that you create; you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government, the elected Afghan government, with the micromanaging tendencies of foreigners on short tours with their own priorities.
But 18 months later, I asked him why he had tried to shoot me.
Now is this a new idea?
Well guess what? It didn't.
Well the answer, of course, is, if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion dollars a year in a country, you co-opt almost everybody.
We need to somehow get their message to the policymakers.
In the Afghan section in London responsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground, I was told last year that there was not a single staff member of the foreign office in that section who had ever served on a posting in Afghanistan.
Bosnia and Kosovo were signal successes, great successes.
But you need to look at context.
Because if what we're interested in is terrorism, Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan.
When you're doing mountain rescue, you don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue, you look for somebody who knows the terrain.
Thank you very much.
Rory Stewart: Okay, I think Libya poses the classic problem.
Instead of which, we've allowed ourselves to be tempted towards regime change.
How do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost? How do you do it?
What is our approach?
It's made of paper and paper, of course, wicks fluid, as you know, paper, cloth -- drop wine on the tablecloth, and the wine wicks all over everything.
Why do we choose paper?
If you've taken a sample of someone's blood and the someone might have hepatitis C, you don't want to make a mistake and stick it in you.
It's something called a lateral flow immunoassay.
So, the approach that we started with is to ask: Is it really practical to make things of this sort?
And there is an example of the kind of thing that you see.
Someone comes into the clinic, they have a fever, they feel bad. What do they have?
He has a wonderful story of talking to a villager in India and saying, "Have you taken your Dapsone?" "Yes."
So, you take the drop of blood, no further manipulations, you put it on a little device, the device filters out the blood cells, lets the serum go through, and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there.
So, my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor, but is an 18-year-old, otherwise unemployed, who has two things: He has a backpack full of these tests, and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample, and an AK-47.
All right now let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices.
And the fluid will flow from one layer into the next.
So, I think it's as low-cost as we're likely to be able to come up and make things.
We were very proud of this, particularly the title, which was "Eggbeater as Centrifuge."
It performs about equivalently to a system that's in the order of 100,000 dollars.
So, I actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people.
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well.
But there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here.
But yeah, what's the matter with Arkansas?
They asked this question.
Here is the same data on a map.
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables.
So yes, racism is predictable.
Probably because if you live on a farm, you might not have a lot of neighbors, period.
But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will, "Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage?"
So if you want to address it, the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races.
You have real neighborhoods and real trees, and real streets you can walk on.
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem, even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism.
Four or five opportunities to see the breast masses, touch the breast mass, intervene at a much earlier stage than when we saw her.
We're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative, transcendent, and is at the heart of the patient-physician relationship.
And a woman comes in with a child, and Conan Doyle describes the following exchange.
And she says, "I am."
And finally, she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand, a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland."
And basically everything we know about percussion, which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day -- organ enlargement, fluid around the heart, fluid in the lungs, abdominal changes -- all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript "Inventum Novum," "New Invention," which would have disappeared into obscurity, except for the fact that this physician, Corvisart, a famous French physician -- famous only because he was physician to this gentleman -- Corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work.
And, oh yes, if you wanted, he would give you a haircut -- short on the sides, long in the back -- and pull your tooth while he was at it.
Fildes' oldest son, Philip, died at the age of nine on Christmas Eve after a brief illness.
The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America.
The discussion is all about images on the computer, data.
And she was reluctant to tell me.
And to her, that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed.
And if I tried, I'd disappoint them.
And when my ritual began, this very voluble patient began to quiet down.
And I always felt that if my patient gave up the quest for the magic doctor, the magic treatment and began with me on a course towards wellness, it was because I had earned the right to tell them these things by virtue of the examination.
We signal the passage of a life with rituals.
I would pull down the eyelids.
When he saw me on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth, his hands moved as if in slow motion.
Although, God knows, of late, in our hubris, we seem to have drifted away.
And unless you've been on Mars recently, you know there's a lot of that out there.
This was being sold to high school administrators for 900 dollars a piece.
Sir, you want to empty your pockets. Please, sir?
And it got it 50 percent of the time -- which is exactly what you'd expect with a coin flip model.
Are science and religion compatible?
And before we say something is out of this world, we should first make sure that it's not in this world.
It's just that it doesn't explain anything.
You don't even need Photoshop; you don't need high-tech equipment; you don't need computers.
So he wrote that he had seen -- "I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies."
And that, in fact, turns out to be true.
And so, you're reducing the quality of your data.
Or if geologists were elephants?
But who does it really look like, the Virgin Mary?
Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside, which they started to wipe off.
There's a ReverseSpeech.com web page from which I downloaded this stuff.
All right, I'm going to just end with a positive, nice, little story about -- the Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization.
At least she got it close.
And said, "I'm so embarrassed.
It's not only preventable; it's actually reversible. And for the last almost 29 years, we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech, expensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography, before and after a year, and cardiac PET scans.
And so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu. Thank you.
Four million of these babies die annually.
I've seen this firsthand over and over again.
You can open it up completely. It's waterproof.
Over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies.
And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace.
Sometimes they get in trouble, but not often.
And we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like.
So they set out to make San Francisco a no-kill city: create an entire city where every dog and cat, unless it was ill or dangerous, would be adopted, not killed.
And then he went to North Carolina and did it again.
We started with the factory idea: that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory that could churn out change.
You can change the fabric of an entire country.
If necessary you can put babies in your ads.
What we've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea, hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause, hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate.
The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all.
That people on the fringes can find each other, connect and go somewhere.
And it turns out that it's tribes -- not money, not factories -- that can change our world, that can change politics, that can align large numbers of people.
What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need, I don't know, a thousand true fans -- a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round.
It also informs the decisions you make when you make products or services.
They merely decided to lead them.
What all these people have in common is that they are heretics.
So Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store.
She doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time.
Because for a lot of people, that's what they're in it for: the connections that are being made, one to the other.
And suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 pairs of shoes.
They challenge what's currently there.
And tribe leaders can do that.
What I want you to do, it only takes 24 hours, is: create a movement.
The reason? Today's current modern medicine is a 60-year-old technique.
However, undeterred due to my teenage optimism -- — I went online to a teenager's two best friends, Google and Wikipedia.
So now that I'd found a reliable protein I could detect, I then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein, and, thus, pancreatic cancer.
However, there's a catch.
So I typed up a budget, a materials list, a timeline, and a procedure, and I emailed it to 200 different professors at Johns Hopkins University and the National Institutes of Health, essentially anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer.
As you can never say no to a kid.
One of the best parts of the sensor, though, is that it has close to 100 percent accuracy, and can detect the cancer in the earliest stages when someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival.
For me, it's all about looking at the Internet in an entirely new way to realize that there's so much more to it than just posting duck-face pictures of yourself online.
Now, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations, Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres.
: Video clips from across the globe.
In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind.
So, for example, there is the character of Noora.
Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.
That's the million-dollar question, right?
A crisis of desire, as in owning the wanting -- desire as an expression of our individuality, of our free choice, of our preferences, of our identity -- desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies.
But now we want our partner to still give us all these things, but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot, and we live twice as long.
What is the relationship between love and desire?
Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest.
And across culture, across religion, and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back.
And in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan, lies that movement toward the other.
For good reasons, right?
What parts of you do you connect to?
You know, animals have sex.
But more importantly, for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark, what sustains desire, I had to go back to the original definition of eroticism, the mystical definition, and I went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma, which is the other side, and I looked at it looking at the community that I had grown up in, which was a community in Belgium, all Holocaust survivors, and in my community there were two groups: those who didn't die, and those who came back to life.
And then I began to ask the reverse question.
If everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses, we wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this.
My partner hasn't taken care of me in so long.
"Are you going to be there?
On the other hand if you can't go, you can't have pleasure, you can't culminate, you don't have an orgasm, you don't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own.
They don't really do well together.

And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room.
And it's been very exciting.
And the music there, I would say, the instruments, the intricate rhythms, the way it's played, the setting, the context, it's all perfect. It all works perfect.
It actually improves it.
This is La Scala.
But Wagner made an innovation.
Around the same, according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker, this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet -- no more eating, drinking and yelling at the stage, or gossiping with one another during the show.
Popular music, coming along at the same time.
These are played mainly in small rooms.
Other singers after him went even further.
There's live music, and there's recorded music.
Live performance, when it was incredibly successful, ended up in what is probably, acoustically, the worst sounding venues on the planet: sports stadiums, basketball arenas and hockey arenas.
I grew up with a radio in a car.
In other ways, it's more like the West African music because if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet, you turn it up, and the next minute, your ears are blasted out by a louder passage.
Other birds, like this tanager, have adapted within the same species.
And I'm saying, well, the passion's still there, but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into, that is instinctively and intuitively created first.
We sing.
Richard can answer that, because he made that decision.
And there was a drunk man on there, and he got up out of his seat two or three times, and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do.
I know that as you have been peering into the future, and as we've heard some of it here tonight, I would like to live in that age and see what is going to be.
He had the favor of God with him.
And David found that there were many problems that technology could not solve.
Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?
We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self-destructive habits we can't break.
Albert Einstein -- I was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton, and I met Mr. Einstein.
The problem is the person or persons using it.
It's the part of you that yearns, really, for God.
I remember once, I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev at a White House dinner.
And afterward, she said, "You know, I'm an atheist, but I know that there's something up there higher than we are."
That's the reason I'm using this podium and using these notes.
I've never met a person in the world that didn't have a problem or a worry.
Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person, and our -- many young people think she's still alive.
And I said, "There's one thing that we have in common in this room, all of us together, whether Republican or Democrat, or whoever."
I've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death.
It passes so fast."
I've done a lot of speaking in Germany and in France, and in different parts of the world -- 105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in.
Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization.
A French historian said, two centuries later, "Seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of Jesus Christ."
He was ready to face him when he died at the age of 39.
I didn't make them in college, until something happened in my heart.
I had to make that decision.

I will not pop, spin, break for you.
I will craft my own drum.
A bunch of pacifists.
It preps you. It aims you.
But my head unwraps around what appears limitless, man's creative violence.
All colors run, none of us solid.
I never was pure.
One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband.
We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all.
Harvest palms, smoke.
In the northwest corner of the United States, right up near the Canadian border, there's a little town called Libby, Montana, and it's surrounded by pine trees and lakes and just amazing wildlife and these enormous trees that scream up into the sky.
He'd been a miner.
She thought about her town.
But she was really amazed.
They said things like, "Well, if it were really dangerous, someone would have told us."
Willful blindness is a legal concept which means, if there's information that you could know and you should know but you somehow manage not to know, the law deems that you're willfully blind.
And when academics have done studies like this of corporations in the United States, what they find is 85 percent of people say yes.
We're all, under certain circumstances, willfully blind.
They're hugely dedicated to the institutions that they work for, and the reason that they speak up, the reason they insist on seeing, is because they care so much about the institution and want to keep it healthy.
Ignorance is bliss, they say, but you can't put up with things like this."
I'm going to take on the naysayers, because they'll make my argument better and stronger.
She's like you, and she's like me.
She was the laughing stock of the community.
And all day she walked around only in her underwear.
I wish to go to school."
She'd lie beside me and say, "Auntie, I wish to be well.
The director of sports who's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class.
In Liberia, for example, the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls.
We go into rural communities and all we do, like has been done in this room, is create the space.
Juanita is her name.
This girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry.
Not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true, the wish of peace came true.
I've also been to places in this U.S., and I know that girls in this country also have wishes, a wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx, a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown L.A., a wish for a better life somewhere in Texas, a wish for a better life somewhere in New York, a wish for a better life somewhere in New Jersey.
But sadly, the vision of a great future, or the dream of a great future, is just a dream, because you have all of these vices.
LG: I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening.
And the theme they used was: "Even pretty girls vote."
LG: You're welcome.
Not a grandmaster with a supercomputer, but actually two American amateurs using three relatively weak laptops.
I'm talking about J.C.R. Licklider's human-computer symbiosis, perhaps better termed "intelligence augmentation," I.A.
We require high-end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing.
Foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus.
So the more you look around you, the more you see Licklider's vision everywhere.
The better the process, the less the friction.
It was, "How do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime?"
As appealing as it might sound, you cannot algorithmically data mine your way to the answer.
These foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf, the Levant and North Africa to join al Qaeda in Iraq.
The friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational time frame using humans, PDFs and tenacity alone.
One seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started rolling.
We're more than 50 years into Licklider's vision for the future, and the data suggests that we should be quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems, man and machine in cooperation together.
So I stepped back from the workforce, and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children.
And the reality of the society that we're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation, where they work long, hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like.
Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you [as] they can get away with.
Walk the dog.
Meditate for half an hour.
There's got to be a middle way.
So I joined a gym."
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective.
He went, "Dad, this has been the best day of my life, ever."
And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.
I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.
Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other.
These impacts are coming everyone's way.
Good.
In the late '40s, my dad -- a Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later he married my mom.
One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.
Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation.
I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths.
We run a project called the Bronx Ecological Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restorations, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs.
Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban "heat island" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine.
In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common.
This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through, like a tiny little bit. You've no clue.
Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier.
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that.
If you're a mayor, you can do something about that.
You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence.
Oh good, glad I have a little more time!
I have come from so far to meet you like this.
And if I could share the image with you on the screen.
But then it changed, and it went on quite well.
Because you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist.
Here you have child mortality -- that is, survival -- four kids dying there, 200 dying there.
How they got slowly richer and richer, and they add statistics.
And it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health, not getting so rich.
And down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India -- present, contemporary India.
And 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.
And we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.
And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.
And this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.
I'm the Mexican in the family.
Because I have to show you one of the other facilities.
And there we are, 2001.
And this is really what has to be changed.
And how do they live?
It comes beyond here, when you really can get good working conditions in the family.
That's when research functions in poor societies -- you must really live with the people.
We hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.
And information will tell her when to go to market with which product.
I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.
Homage to the Office package, no?
All these things are important for development, especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare.
Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.
Environment is very, very crucial.
And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.
And I'm going to take this blade of steel, and push it down through my body of blood and flesh, and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.
So in the search box I typed in "Mother's Day," and I was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards that showed up on the Scratch website, many of them just in the past 24 hours by procrastinators just like myself.
And actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would.
By writing, be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards, these kids were showing that they were really fluent with new technologies.
It's almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies.
And that triggered a debate in the U.K.
After you've created your program, you can click on "share," and then share your project with other people, so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well.
Here's an example.
As kids are creating projects like this, they're learning to code, but even more importantly, they're coding to learn.
But that's just where it starts.
In Scratch, you can create something called a variable.
It doesn't happen in most classrooms, but that's because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables, they don't know why they're learning it.
Now those are important skills that aren't just relevant for coding.
Again, the same thing with coding.
So as we take a look and we see that Michael Bloomberg is learning to code, all of the children of Estonia learn to code, even my mom has learned to code, don't you think it's about time that you might be thinking about learning to code?
The billboards say "Lab Space Available."
We didn't sequence his genome.
But what it means is that we fail to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins, into which we, like molecular locksmiths, can fashion an active, small, organic molecule or drug substance.
And the reason is that cancer, like every cell in the body, places little molecular bookmarks, little Post-it notes, that remind the cell "I'm cancer; I should keep growing."
And we sent it to Oxford, England where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture, which helped us understand exactly how this molecule is so potent for this protein target.
The next step would be to put this molecule into mice.
At the Lurie Family Center for Animal Imaging, my colleague, Andrew Kung, grew this cancer successfully in mice without ever touching plastic.
Well they probably would keep this a secret until they turn a prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical substance.
But the science that's coming back from all of these laboratories about the use of this molecule has provided us insights that we might not have had on our own.
We have this molecule, but it's not a pill yet.
And really this is the fourth of these molecules to kind of graduate from our little pipeline of drug discovery, two of which -- a topical drug for lymphoma of the skin, an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myeloma -- will actually come to the bedside for first clinical trial in July of this year.
This research is funded by the public.
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.
I've often wondered, what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn't have any.
If you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up.
What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies, a hundred billion stars each.
And Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy.
The reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy.
That's our job as cosmologists.
So he says -- I'm not going to do the accent -- he says, "For some reason, the universe, at one time, had a very low entropy for its energy content, and since then the entropy has increased.
If you come back a billion years later and look at it again, it will be moving away faster.
This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future.
There's a finite region of space that we have access to, surrounded by a horizon.
Well what is the implication of that?
So Boltzmann says, look, you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium.
Remember, life itself depends on the arrow of time.
Carl Sagan once famously said that "in order to make an apple pie, you must first invent the universe."
Even if you left our galaxy out, you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies.
I just showed you this picture.
But even black holes don't last forever.
You might say, "Well there's nothing there to be living," but that's not right.
An egg, an unbroken egg, is a low entropy configuration, and yet, when we open our refrigerator, we do not go, "Hah, how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator."
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse.
It was a simple machine that changed my life.
I would like to share that story today.
My family ate one meal per day, at night.
So I went to a library.
Many people, including my mother, said I was crazy.
I had never seen an airplane before.
We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us.
So, I started this exploration around eight years back, and it literally started with a mouse on my desk.
I thought, "Why can I not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world?"
A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee, or where you can trash the cup.
Maybe, "How about I take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information?"
Later, we moved to a much better, consumer-oriented pendant version of that, that many of you now know as the SixthSense device.
We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands, so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present.
Here, I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand.
It will change the way we interact with people, also, not only the physical world.
So now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly I'm touching the paper.
And why only computers? We can just play with papers.
So, Pranav, first of all, you're a genius.
PM: I'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own SixthSense device, because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own.
And now, if you see, it's more about the cost-effectiveness: this system costs you $300 compared to the $20,000 surface tables, or anything like that.
It's a great honor to be here talking about cities, talking about the future of cities.
Jacques Rogge: I have the honor to announce that the games of the 31st Olympiad are awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro.
We really showed that, yes, we can.
EP: Okay, some parts of Rio are pretty much like that, but it's not like that everywhere.
This is going to be the third largest park in Rio by June this year.
So how do you move these people around?
You transform it inside as a train car.
So spending much less money and doing it much faster, you can really change the way people move.
And this is the most controversial one.
You see the contrast between the rich and poor.
The second point I want to make about the favelas is, you've got to open spaces in the favela.
You cannot deal with a city if it's not socially integrated.
You can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scenes.
So Osorio, good to be there with you.
People get mad at the mayor. So how's the traffic tonight?
We are below average in terms of traffic incidents in the city.
Public services working well.
And we cannot see that as a problem.
I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics, actually, for a living.
Of course, a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question, "What is beauty?"
Or just think about American jazz or American movies -- they go everywhere.
The experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations.
In fact, it goes against natural survival.
It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover.
The ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience.
Beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair, as well as ochre body paint, have been found from around 100,000 years ago.
And some, in any event, are too big to use for butchery.
Except, of course, what's interesting about this is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed, because the Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language.
We find beauty in something done well.
And the answer I like to offer is what they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war.
Because it's got all those A's lined up I guess.
The question is, what's the good you can do with it?
I don't know, the Million Man Swim.
We can run the score up against anybody, and then get our asses kicked in the second half -- what they call fourth generation warfare.
So there's no trouble accessing battle spaces.
You have to create internal partners. You have to access coalition partners.
It's your oil, not ours."
It's just too damn hard.
I think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war.
They got out on the far end, we said, "Fine, don't worry about it."
What can they do?
I'll do it on Tuesday. It will cost you 20 billion dollars."
We haven't faced an imminent threat since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.
What do you get then?
What we need is an international reconstruction fund -- Sebastian Mallaby, Washington Post, great idea.
You've got to build this force. You've got to seed this force.
Would you like a better system?
The problem is you need a big, sexy opponent to fight against.
They spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world What I call the core and the gap.
I'd say, "You're buying one military and you're operating another, and eventually it's going to hurt. It's wrong.
It's not our system of governance.
Going back to the beginning of our country -- historically, defenses meant protection of the homeland.
To attack America is to risk blowing up the world.
Some people say, "Hell, 9/11 did it for you."
It's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him.
It's why I travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries.
You need the experience.
Including us, I would remind you.
I like them young, male, unmarried, slightly pissed off.
The force on the left is never coming under the purview of the International Criminal Court.
I say, "Great, I'm going to take the Sys Admin budget out of your hide."
Last slide.
I want them to be Marines.
You'll see the pattern -- airborne, just like carriers.
Civil Affairs, that bastard child, comes over here.
I want the rules to be as loose as possible.
What should be the CIA, open, analytical, open source should come over here.
Thanks.
We decided to give it a try, because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"
But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment, in a flat, closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones.
We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car.
So for this, we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology.
This is the sensory data, and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer.
So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it, and compressed air comes out, so it can actually draw images.
We also had some surprises. Let's take a look.
And he's perfectly making his way between the two.
But sometimes -- But sometimes I also do get -- I wouldn't call it hate mail -- but letters of really strong concern: "Dr. Hong, are you insane, trying to put blind people on the road?
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project.
I'd done well at school. Expectations for me were high, and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures, parties and traffic cone theft.
This was the beginning. The voice had arrived.
Such fear and mistrust was infectious.
Now it's down on my medical records that Eleanor has delusions that she's a television news broadcaster.
Well, you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students."
Many people have harmed me in my life, and I remember them all, but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who've helped me.
Now at first, I would have believed them.
The voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it, and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly, and as such, it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care.
And all the while, I listened to my voices, with whom I'd finally learned to live with peace and respect and which in turn reflected a growing sense of compassion, acceptance and respect towards myself.
In the last 20 years, the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents, working together to promote dignity, solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress, to create a new language and practice of hope, which, at its very center, lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual.
Thank you.
And so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered.
So, let's leave that aside.
So the asteroids we don't have much hope for.
There are plans to do it, but it's hard.
Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years, finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great -- much greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean.
But better -- what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight.
This was -- originally, when radio astronomy began, Mr. Jansky, at the Bell labs, detected radio waves coming from the sky.
There is something called pit lamping.
So I have proposed to apply the same trick to looking for life in the universe.
But I hope that we shall look, and with any -- we probably won't find anything, none of these speculations may have any basis in fact.
I call these creatures sunflowers.
That would be a fun thing to do.
And my mom took these pictures actually, last week, of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.
And I realized then I had to go to design school.
"You know, do people really use it?
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.
And just by drawing on a little computer tablet, the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.
And it's done in a very simple way: one just touches the base of the light, and on one side, you can mix the brightness, and on the other, the coloration of the light.
But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff, and all the nerdy stuff out of it, and try to make it as beautiful as we can.
And then, on the other side of the room, the designers are making small adjustments, sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.
And here's another project, another partnership-type approach.
And it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor, when others can be creative and do more with it.
But the third pillar that he talked about was design.
I mean, they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is.
But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland, and he had the laptop for an afternoon, and I had to take it back. It was hard.
It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant, and it has to be easily serviceable: you have to know where it is and what it does.
It was breaking the ice, it was getting over a stigma, and I think that's also what design can do.
I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree.
You can see my little video there conducting these people, alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home.
I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach, Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College, some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and — -- and in the second half of the piece, the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers from 30 different countries.
Given my TED profile, you might be expecting that I'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends -- the one that's currently got Wall Street and the World Bank buzzing -- how to invest in women, how to empower them, how to save them.
Is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing?
And for reasons equally unclear to me, seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us.
They broke her bangles.
By 18, under the excellent tutelage of my mother, I was therefore, as you might expect, defiantly feminist.
She was the most determined advocate for women's rights I had ever heard.
She is also immensely pragmatic.
Sakena is a teacher at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in Afghanistan.
To be a lesbian, a dyke, a homosexual in most parts of the world, including right here in our country, India, is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice.
I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion, in which people can really speak their voice, especially traditional songs from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic.
Yesterday, Mallika Sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given.
We need peace, and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace.
They stood for weeks -- first just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women -- wearing white, singing, dancing, saying they were out for peace.
As the senior officer approaches with a baton, Layma stands up with deliberation, reaches her arms up over her head, and begins, very slowly, to untie her headdress that covers her hair.
And the women of Liberia then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in Africa in years.
But we also need the heat from the top.
So that, as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights, the same is true of gender equality: that it starts in small places, close to home.
It is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities, that I find hope.
Overnight, my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak -- a single mother in Sacramento, a girl being bullied in rural Kansas, all asking me, a 22-year-old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order, to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox.
And a man just stared at me, and he was like, "Well, why don't you use the Internet?"
We still clutch close these letters to our chest, to the words that speak louder than loud, when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say, the words that we have needed to write, to sisters and brothers and even to strangers, for far too long.
Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine, so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill, if you have this embedded in your device at the same time, and you do the chemistry, you may be able to make drugs in a new way.
Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it, we could deploy it anywhere.
Well, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator.
They were together while praying.
Quite ironic.
Seclusion of women was actually a Byzantine and Persian practice, and Muslims adopted that and made that a part of their religion.
Maybe it's a Middle Eastern culture that became confused with Islam.
The Muslims in North Africa, not in other places.
For example, in Saudi Arabia there is a phenomenon called the religious police.
Maybe it's a problem of the political culture, and we have to think about how to change that political culture."
But one thing was curious: most of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later, not from the very divine core of Islam, the Koran, but from, again, traditions and mentalities, or the interpretations of the Koran that Muslims made in the Middle Ages.
That interpretation is quite possible and feasible.
That trend is generally called Islamic modernism, and it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen, not just as an intellectual idea though, but also as a political program.
And even the very extreme forms of Islamism led to terrorism in the name of Islam -- which is actually a practice that I think is against Islam, but some, obviously, extremists did not think that way.
And when you have colonization what do you have?
And that's the country where I come from; that's Turkey.
Secondly, in the past two decades, thanks to globalization, thanks to the market economy, thanks to the rise of a middle-class, we in Turkey see what I define as a rebirth of Islamic modernism.
You must have all seen the Arab Spring, which began in Tunis and in Egypt.
And I believe that the Islamic modernism which began in the 19th century, but which had a setback in the 20th century because of the political troubles of the Muslim world, is having a rebirth.
And if we compare this to more recent representations of the visual system, you'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated over the intervening thousand years.
There's no structure. It won't tell you anything.
So somehow it shows what's there.
And so coming back to the brain, this is from a genetically engineered mouse called "Brainbow."
This, for example, is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain.
Thank you.
In Georgia, after years of stalemate, we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence in August, 2008.
But hang on, this talk is to be about the good news.
Despite the up and down since then, the overall trend -- and this is the important bit -- clearly points downward for the past two decades.
And they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally.
At times, they are complimented by negotiated settlements, or at least cease-fire agreements, and peacekeepers are deployed.
Central among them, a commitment to exclusively peaceful means.
By no means.
Changes and shortcomings in leadership, more off than on international diplomacy and institutional failures account for this in almost equal measure.
So even in situations where outcomes are less than optimal, local leaders and international leaders have a choice, and they can make a difference for the better.
Second, diplomacy.
Yet, no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have.
I wanted to visualize the story of life.
I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time.
Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force.
And they changed the atmosphere.
It learned to move and began to see. The first eyes grew on trilobites.
The fundamental forms of ferns followed, to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds.
One early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday.
But when that ancient continent broke up, life got lusher.
But there were witnesses, survivors in the dark.
Walruses adapted with layers of fat. Sea lions got sleek.
And our brains -- our celebrated brains -- reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next.
Pretty much in every case, that's how a charity starts.
Now trust me, when you're growing a mustache back in 2003, and there were 30 of us back then, and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement — — it created a lot of controversy.
And I started to research that topic, and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it.
We can't have anything to do with you."
It was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought, we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund Movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level.
We had Mo Bros from Canada, from the U.S., and from the U.K. emailing us and calling us and saying, hey, there's nothing for prostate cancer.
And we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure, we're about finding the cure.
And that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches.
And it's like, everything single person, every single Mo Bro and Mo Sista that participates in Movember is our celebrity ambassador, and that is so, so important and fundamental to our success.
And he goes, "Last year, my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka, because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her," and he said, "This mustache is my tribute to my mom."
And I looked at him, and I was like, "I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache."
We literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world, and when we looked at this more recently, we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions, let alone nationally, let alone globally, and this is not unique to prostate cancer. This is cancer research the world over.
Thank you.
We wanted to share our stories with each other.
So when he was only 10 and he became the paje, he began to lead his people.
Benki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies, new research, new ways of understanding what was going on.
he would tell you, as he told me, "I asked myself," he said, "What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do to protect the forest for me?
We know climate change is going to affect all of us.
You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done, because we'll get the results we've always gotten.
I started life as a banker.
She loved it, but she was too detached.
Since that time, under her leadership, Samraksha has been a pioneer in all fields related to HIV/AIDS.
But he saw the work, the care, the compassion that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village, and he wanted to be part of it.
If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra and ask her why and how, how have you achieved so much?
I was lucky; I had heard about him for years, and I finally met him earlier this year at his museum in Chengdu.
But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.
But they have qualities we'd all recognize.
And they have humility.
We can look at what they've done, if we look.
But his brother, Ganesha, simply walked around his parents once, twice, thrice, and said, "I won."
It's the myth that we live in.
Yours is faith.
Perhaps he was a Jain monk, like Bahubali over here, the Gomateshwara Bahubali whose image is not far from Mysore.
It's pointless."
You should not be Sisyphus, who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night.
He heard of a man called Bharat, after whom India is called Bhārata.
But they were not two characters on two different adventures.
You go again and again and again.
Not only do they live infinite lives, but the same life is lived infinite times till you get to the point of it all.
So, the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements.
Take a look.
But in India there is no "the" promised land.
It is not about documentation and contract.
Which is rooted in one-life culture.
So, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry.
I would give my viewpoints to people.
Sounds so simple.
Hindus don't have the concept of commandments.
And based on this, we created a ritual for leaders.
And everybody asks me, "Which is the better way, this way or that way?"
And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular.
I'm an economist. I do dismal.
I'm going to talk about those looking for great jobs, great careers, and why you're going to, why you're going to fail.
Then, your other excuse is, "Yes, there are special people who pursue their passions, but they are geniuses.
I'm not weird. I've read Steven J.'s biography.
You know what? Here's a little secret.
I say, "Do you have passion?"
Passion is the thing that will help you create the highest expression of your talent.
Let us merge our interests."
Your friends and family will be gathered in the cemetery, and there, beside your gravesite will be a tombstone, and inscribed on that tombstone, it will say, "Here lies a distinguished engineer who invented Velcro."
I want to be a great parent, and I will not sacrifice them on the altar of great accomplishment."
What a wimp.
And what do you say?
Or, are you going to tell him this?
You know why.
How can you be one without the other?
If you don't, you're not alone.
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump.
Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines.
And that proportion is primarily genetically determined.
The problem with breast density is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.
Mammograms have been around since the 1960's, and it's changed very little.
And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors, but it's also very expensive.
Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on innovation, and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual's genius.
And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel, where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.
So after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape -- -- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out, and we attached the new detector, and we decided to call this machine Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.
So how does this work?
So here's an example.
Here's an example from that screening study.
And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram.
But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive -- it's as accurate as MRI, it's far less complex to interpret, and it's a fraction of the cost.
So until something is available for women with dense breasts, there are things that you should know to protect yourself.
And fourth and most important, the mammography debate will rage on, but I do believe that all women 40 and older should have an annual mammogram.
But for women with dense breasts; we shouldn't abandon screening altogether, we need to offer them something better.
We have a lot of data, so we have a lot of power.
That's the kind of power we have because of all of the data that we have.
When you come to my website, I actually know what you're going to do already because I've seen you visit millions of websites before.
We're just building this stuff. Somebody else is using it."
So we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good?
You'd think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn't be such suckers just for the pretty phones.
Mill.
Our parents teach us that: praise with the good, scold with the bad.
We're numbers people, living by numbers.
He wanted to know what is just.
Favorite number. I love that number.
What if, Plato thought, ethics was like math?
He wants objective truths.
But don't give up.
What if morals, what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain?
I thought, that guy looks suspicious.
He has autonomy.
So let's cut to the chase.
Ethics requires thinking.
It arises from not thinking."
Or now we have a few more choices.
Go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision.
And they gathered together because the technologists wanted to learn what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective.
It's Gods and mythical creatures fighting over magical jewelry."
We're the ones writing this opera.
So, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak.
Marketing people have never been able to do that.
But I didn't want it to make it by isolating people, without any earmuffs or those kind of things.
It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain.
You feel the effect of the white noise?
A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend.
This object is completely covered by fiber opticals.
And I submit them, my intuitions, my hypothesis, my first ideas.
You have to know that today, roughly one or two every drug pills is not taken correctly.
And its purpose is to help patient to go to the end of the treatment.
And you follow the treatment like that, to the end of the treatment.
So the idea is, all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself, including air and molecules, for sure.
And John Maeda was supposed to show several graphic animations in this exhibition.
It would be a great honor, a great compliment for me, if he hadn't decided to take all them off two hours before the opening.
A very natural technology, in order to say to the miners, "The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency."
It's the same for me with the carpet.
So the idea is to create an object able to force the air, and to be in contact at the right speed at the right place, in all the effective parts of the plant.
The locavores used to get food taken in a radius of 100 miles.
Or you start fishing.
So I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris, a very stimulative, brain-stimulative office.
You can see it there.

First, I want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence on inner-city gangs.
So being a gang leader in the inner city wasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s.
You couldn't sell cocaine.
And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell, crack cocaine was the extra-chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city.
And it turned out, there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine, but, when it came, it really did.
Not really me -- I'm really a bit player in all this.
So he showed up at the University of Chicago.
This is about 1990 -- peak of the crack epidemic.
So the choice of answers were: very good, good, bad and very bad.
Went up to the floor, the second floor, and said: "Hey, guys.
They trusted Sudhir -- in ways that really no academic has ever -- or really anybody, any outsider -- has ever earned the trust of these gangs, to the point where they actually opened up what was most interesting for me: their books, their financial records that they kept.
And Sudhir says it's not like these guys had a very sophisticated kind of view of like, what happened in American corporate life.
They get the name of the gang behind them, for merchandising and marketing.
In fact, in these neighborhoods, they'd be the same people.
It really is not fiction -- it's fact.
And it actually was the right choice, probably, to try to make it out -- this way.
That is about as high as you can get.
To put it into perspective, if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq, for instance, right now fighting the war: 0.5 percent.
So there are striking similarities, I think, to the Internet boom, right?
So everybody got stuck at that $3.50-an-hour job, and it turned out to be a disaster.
That 14-year-old kid would say: "Oh, well ..."
This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics, called a "compensating differential."
He says, "Would you stand around here when all this shit" -- that means shooting -- "if all this shit's going on? No, right?
He says, "If we start shooting around there," -- in the other gang's territory -- "nobody, and, I mean, you dig it, nobody, going to step on their turf.
His response is, "You got all these niggers below you who want your job, you dig?
From there I started with skydiving.
You can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board, there is a lot of force, a lot of power.
BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects, like buildings, antennae, bridges and earth -- meaning mountains, cliffs.
So with some friends we started to do different tricks, like for example this jump here, I jumped from a paraglider.
So for 2009, I'm training hard for my two new projects.
Because it looks like it might.
All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions.
What do you do to to cover your face?
and do you ever say, "No, no I'm not going to."
We have an annual gathering of people, and that is called Life in Space.
I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting.
I also put a mirror in the ceiling, and some fog, some haze.
She wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not.
Is art about that?
It makes a difference whether you say, "I'm a part of this city.
These are ongoing experiments.
I've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland.
If you have a waterfall in there, right out there at the horizon; you look at the waterfall and you go, "Oh, the water is falling really slowly."
And why would we want to do that?
What does the word "public" mean today anyway?
And experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way.
Every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale.
It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit, a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel that summer during Shark Week.
It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier.
The approach worked.
Now, what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light, and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.
Exploration is the engine that drives innovation.
"The Sleepy Giant," which is the song that I just sang, is one of his poems.
Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn.
He went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children.
He became a Jesuit.
And the poem is called, "Spring and Fall."
Okay, we're going to start that verse again.
Decrescendo.
How do we explore intelligence in this animal that's so different from us?
They're emotional. They're aware.
And you can't get more alien than the dolphin.
What I wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control.
And they started to quickly imitate the sounds they were hearing on the keyboard.
So as an adult, when I started to read about the amazing breakthroughs with Penny Patterson and Koko, with Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and Kanzi, Panbanisha, Irene Pepperberg, Alex the parrot, I got all excited.
PG: So groom was the subject of the piece.
And Sue Savage-Rumbaugh got excited about that, called her friend Steve Woodruff, and we began hustling all sorts of people whose work related or was inspiring, which led us to Diana, and led us to Neil.
This is a $1 web server, and at the time that was radical.
So the first site we're going to meet is Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, with orangutans.
Next user group are the dolphins at the National Aquarium.
As Diana mentioned, our animals are involved in many different research studies.
So at that point, if we can go back to the other computer, we were starting to think about how you integrate the rest of the biomass of the planet into the Internet, and we went to the best possible person I can think of, which is Vint Cerf, who is one of the founders who gave us the Internet. Vint?
That's a number only that Congress can appreciate.
Well, you know where this is headed.
There are machines that need to talk to machines and that we need to talk to, and so as time goes on, we're going to have to learn how to communicate with computers and how to get computers to communicate with us in the way that we're accustomed to, not with keyboards, not with mice, but with speech and gestures and all the natural human language that we're accustomed to.
So first of all, thank you, and I would like to acknowledge that four people who could talk to us for full four days actually managed to stay to four minutes each, and we thank you for that.
Right, and do you have a web address that we might look for yet?
I know you mentioned that a keyboard is a really key part of this.
This is an image of me and my daughter holding the Israeli flag.
Most of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook, my friends like it, don't like it, most of the time don't like it, don't share it, don't nothing, and it's another day.
So I start answering this girl, and she's telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come, because they don't have a computer, she asked her family to come to see the poster, and they're all sitting in the living room crying.
So I'm going to shoot all the people I know, if they want, and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them.
And we received Israeli posters, Israeli images, but also lots of comments, lots of messages from Iran.
They want to respond. They want to say the same thing.
So she said, "Everybody in Palestine, in where? Israel?
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel."
Today the Israel-Loves-Iran page is this number, 80,831, and two million people last week went on the page and shared, liked, I don't know, commented on one of the photos.
What?
I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time. And we just shake hands, and have a coffee and a nice discussion, and we talk about food and basketball.
Now people from Iran, the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent, you know, their foot and half their faces, now they're sending their faces, and they're saying, "Okay, no problem, we're into it. We are with you."
So to me, this is the courageous thing to do, to try to reach the other side before it's too late, because when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late.
Oh my God.
We call this comic book "Yes is More," which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes.
Rather than revolution, we're much more interested in evolution, this idea that things gradually evolve by adapting and improvising to the changes of the world.
A very literal way of showing it is a project we did for a library and a hotel in Copenhagen.
You never know when you might need it.
We even double checked.
And with the People's Building, he saw an architecture that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China and the progressive future of China.
Gradually, you get this idea that sustainable life is less fun than normal life.
The biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall.
Meanwhile, in Copenhagen we're actually expanding the bicycle lanes.
So just like with a bike, we don't talk about it.
And when she's gone, we're going to invite a Chinese artist to reinterpret her.
So, when it came out in Denmark that we were actually going to move our national monument, the National People's Party sort of rebelled against it.
So the second story that I'd like to tell is, actually starts in my own house.
And because Copenhagen is completely flat, if you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view, you basically have to do it yourself.
And the facade of the parking, we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated, so we needed to perforate it.
This idea that you can actually create, if not gold, then at least added value by mixing traditional ingredients, like normal apartments and normal parking, and in this case actually offer people the chance that they don't have to choose between a life with a garden or a life in the city.
At the same time, we actually had a visitor -- a minister from Azerbaijan came to our office.
Then we place these mountains on the island, surrounding this sort of central green valley, almost like a central park.
They accumulate the water.
I'm not going to talk about "The Skeptical Environmentalist" -- probably that's also a good choice.
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS.
We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world, and I will just briefly read them: climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education, financial instability, governance and corruption, malnutrition and hunger, population migration, sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers.
But we don't have a technology to solve that, right?
Please, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor, and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world's biggest issues.
And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones, it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list.
It could be a family-size pizza; it could be a very individual-size pizza, right?
What would be the price?
And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question -- -- because that's a very good question.
They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects -- basically, projects where if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back.
And I'll actually also try to get back to this because it's probably one of the things that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.
All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100.
It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it.
The incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year.
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition.
And again, in an ideal world, we would do both.
Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again.
Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight.
The other objections, I think, that are important to say, is that I'm somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice.
If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine.
They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did, to come up with their own lists.
We did it in 2004, and we hope to assemble many more people, getting much better information for 2008, 2012.
At the time, these words were earmarked and targeted against the British, but over the last 200 years, they've come to embody what many Westerners believe, that freedom is the most cherished value, and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them.
This schism has only grown wider.
I'm not saying people in the emerging markets don't understand democracy, nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders.
First of all, it's China's economic performance over the past 30 years.
However, these two countries have the identical GINI Coefficient, which is a measure of income equality.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's no surprise that around the world, people are pointing at what China is doing and saying, "I like that. I want that.
And only if your per capita income is above 6,000 dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water.
Well, the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism; greater protectionisms of nation-states; but also, as I just pointed out a moment ago, ever-declining political rights and individual rights.
The fact of the matter is that instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with China, the West should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions.
It put a man on the moon.
I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969.
Thank you very much.
You can see, there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there.
If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S., any salary increase you're going to experience will have only a tiny, tiny influence on your overall well-being.
A fellow TED speaker, Jonathan Haidt, came up with this beautiful little analogy between the conscious and the unconscious mind.
And so it's quite surprising that many of us let our unconscious influence those decisions in ways that we are not quite aware of.
So I am looking still for a Stephanie.
Quite consciously, design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques, just basically to fight straightforward adaptation.
And I of course knew stuff, as a designer, about typography, even though we worked with those animals not so successfully.
But then I met a biologist, and now I think of materials like this -- green tea, sugar, a few microbes and a little time.
And once you get this process going, you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid.
And they're sticking together, forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface.
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.
Using fruit and vegetable staining, create organic patterning.
So what I want to do is say to a future bug, "Spin me a thread.
There's no waste.
Suzanne, just a curiosity, what you're wearing is not random.
Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes, or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your iPad.
They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money, to learn new skills, and to see the world.
All of these speakers, by the way, are young women, 18 or 19 years old.
All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn't even understand.
For example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out two and a half months' wages for an iPhone.
About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min, she invited me home to her family village for the Chinese New Year.
Min's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her for the new year, said, "It doesn't look like it's worth that much."
They were fresh, functional, and women everywhere adored them. A new American classic was born."
Across China, there are 150 million workers like her, one third of them women, who have left their villages to work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants and the construction sites of the big cities.
This purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine, sitting in your office or in the library, are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world.
So, if you really want to help these workers, start these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes in these schools, and what's going to happen is, all your workers are going to move on, but hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple, and you can help their social mobility and their self-improvement.
Certainly, the factory conditions are really tough, and it's nothing you or I would want to do, but from their perspective, where they're coming from is much worse, and where they're going is hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give that context of what's going on in their minds, not what necessarily is going on in yours.
In return, they provide free food and shelter and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend.
Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy: He tells me that children are then given months of military training.
Then they ship them off, hundreds of miles away to hard-line schools that run along the Taliban agenda.
Their parents are so poor, they have no resources to get them back.
They're ready to go out and fight because they've been told that this is effectively their only way to glorify Islam.
Do you want to carry out a suicide attack?
If my intention was to eradicate evil for Islam, then I will be rewarded with paradise.
And especially since about 2007, when I got an iPhone, I was not only sitting in front of my screen all day, but I was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket.
And then this happened.
Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit?
The Internet was that amorphous blob, or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it.
If the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we live in a global village, it's because there are cables underneath the ocean, cables like this.
And the landscape is changing. Three years ago, when I started thinking about this, there was one cable down the Western coast of Africa, represented in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.
They have -- this is literally a beam of light around the world, and if a cable breaks in the Pacific, it'll send it around the other direction. And then having done that, they started to look for places to wire next.
Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship, and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place.
And then the process on shore takes around three or four days, and then, when it's done, they put the manhole cover back on top, and they push the sand over that, and we all forget about it.
We can actually build for you, very rapidly, a physical object.
But today, it is becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful.
And this material that's deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form.
But what you'll notice about all of these products is they're very, very intricate.
And this was built by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer in layers of about five millimeters to 10 mm in thickness -- slowly growing this structure.
And actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well is that you can create bespoke products en masse.
It's very, very, very detailed inside with the design.
Typically an implant is more effective within the body if it's more porous, because our body tissue will grow into it.
You can buy a machine today for about $300 that you can create yourself, which is quite incredible.
3D printing can be also used to download spare parts from the Web.
Which means that we can now present to the public the next generation of customization.
Imagine that you can now engage with a brand and interact, so that you can pass your personal attributes to the products that you're about to buy.
And when somebody is ready to purchase the product in their personalized design, they click "Enter" and this data gets converted into the data that a 3D printer reads and gets passed to a 3D printer, perhaps on someone's desktop.
So as long as you have the data, you can create the part on demand.
It's very intricate.
We're all different sizes and our companies the same.
It's a very powerful word, jihad, if you look at it in that respect, and there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it.
His idea of jihad was a global war of terror, primarily targeted at the far enemy, at the crusaders from the West, against America.
On Fridays in his mosque, he gave sermons trying to reclaim the meaning of the word, but his congregants, the people who came to his mosque, they had seen the videos. They had seen pictures of the planes going into the towers, the towers coming down.
That was the power of that word that he was able to do.
The wealthy fanatics who were previously sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous.
There are other groups -- in Nigeria, Boko Haram, in Somalia, al Shabaab -- and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden.
You may remember these guys.
And then the Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar to Osama bin Laden. He made it our problem.
Who killed bin Ladenism? Let's start with bin Laden himself.
Who killed Osama bin Laden? The SEAL Team Six.
But many of these other factors that were in play are now even stronger than before. Half the work is already done.
Some of the other things that they need we're not very good at giving. Maybe nobody is.
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years, and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?
And it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs: a hard place to grow up.
And they would look quizzically, and then be like, "High five!"
And so she ultimately turned to prostitution.
Some of them might be ones you gave.
And so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations, loans and investments that will go the long term with them, they built a low-cost housing development, about an hour outside Nairobi central.
Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home at the end of the day?" She said "If you gave me 10 minutes my bags would be packed."
And in the middle of this economic crisis, where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear, I think we're well suited to take a cue from Jane and reach out, recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary.
Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days.
I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges.
No. I wrote it in a month.
When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this.
I had just taken trigonometry in high school, I learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus.
And I earned enough money to pay for my first year of Caltech.
And then in 1983, Lotus 1-2-3 came out, and I was completely blown away by Lotus 1-2-3.
So what about making energy?
Hopefully, if we can reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells, that will become more practical.
I'll be very short on genetic algorithms.
They have to track the sun, because they have to be pointing directly at the sun.
Solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though.
And you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes, for a dollar.
Those were major breakthroughs.
But after the Stirling engine, Otto came along, and also, he didn't invent the internal combustion engine, he just refined it.
So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way, because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application The internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around.
And that's the process we took -- let me show you how the engine works.
You move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end, down to the hot end and up to the cold end.
So you're reusing your energy five or six times, and that brings the efficiency up between 30 and 40 percent It's a little known, but brilliant, genius invention of Robert Stirling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical -- like I found out when I made the real simple version in high school -- to very potentially possible, once you get the efficiency up, if you can design this to be low enough cost.
So this is the engine.
This is being run out in the sun, and now I want to show you what the actual thing looks like.
What it does is it searches to find the hottest spot, it searches again a half an hour later, it searches again a day later, it searches again a month later.
Let me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running.
So you're still using the grid potentially, in this type of application, to be your back-up supply -- of course, you can't use these at night, and you can't use these on cloudy days.
And all this does is affect the payback period, it doesn't mean that you couldn't use solar energy; you could use solar energy anywhere on Earth.
We believe we're getting very close to something practical and affordable.
There's 10,000 watts of light pouring on the stage, one horsepower is 756 watts, at full power.
And we don't have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are, I think.
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic.
But despite its very small weight, enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet.
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales.
And this plane, the model, BA146, which was run by FAAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people.
It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule.
Thank you very much.
I was lucky enough to be completely ignored, which is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you.
And I decided that I wanted to tell -- but I still wanted to tell a narrative story and I still wanted to tell my stories.
But the point was that I was there as myself, as a dreamer.
I don't really -- I mean, I could tell you that I didn't understand, I'm not proud of it, but I didn't understand let's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference.
So, I hopefully am writing, you know, books that are good for children and for adults.
I never -- I don't like plots.
I work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happened and it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it.
They're not."
And they said yes, and they left me completely alone, which was a gorgeous, wonderful thing.
So, there's a kind of British understatement, murder-mystery theme that I really love very much.
And basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing, because I said, "Well, how much space do I have?"
And then he breathed his last, with loved ones around him, and I know that he had chicken soup also, as his last meal."
Which I think I made up, which is a good thing.
Facts were actually banished from our home.
And I say, "I hope he's not really dead, just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow, but the caption says he is dead."
How do we know when we are ourselves?
Could we have -- no, we don't have time.
And she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out.
And a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.
Tyler Dewar: The way I feel right now is that all of the other speakers have said exactly what I wanted to say.
And these days, people ask me a lot, how did that feel.
So it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa wasn't going to come true.
TD: So those were just a few remarks about my personal background.
I feel that there are some things that are getting in the way.
Maybe we could look at that to be more similar to the falling of the Berlin Wall, where a divide that had kept two types of people apart had collapsed and opened up a door for further communication.
So I think the way forward for the world -- one that will bring the path of outer development in harmony with the real root of happiness -- is that we allow the information that we have to really make a change in our heart.
I would tell them, "It's because I have to talk tomorrow."
So what can we do about that? What can we say?
Put them all together, and put all this under kind of natural selection, under mutation, and rewarded things for how well they can move forward.
It has eight motors, four on the knees and four on the hip.
But when you look at that, you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward, nor did it have a model of itself.
But after a very short while, you can see these blue things on the right there begin to take over.
So the first question is, why do we need to even worry about a pandemic threat?
Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H5N1 flu -- some of you call it bird flu -- which first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s, but we didn't know about it until 1997.
There has been this centralized event in a place called Lake Chenghai, China.
So one thought is: after 9/11, when the airports closed, our flu season was delayed by two weeks.
We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats, and now also domestic pet dogs.
We have seen human-to-human transmission in at least three clusters -- fortunately involving very intimate contact, still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk.
Add on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble.
If it were Los Angeles, is it the mayor, the governor, the President of the United States, the head of Homeland Security?
Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.
What about quarantine?
What they found was, the core functions -- you know you still sort of had banks, but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines.
Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks?
Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time, well, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.
When I say enough, that's two weeks worth.
The pandemic circulated three times in 18 months in the absence of commercial air travel.
The low-ball estimate is 35 million.
What mask works, what mask doesn't work.
Do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue, and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu?
It probably does reduce exposure because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other, or touching common objects and sharing things via their hands.
Clearly the bottom line is the virus eventually attenuates, and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity, and finds other hosts.
Audience member: Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful.
LG: Right. So I have for a long time said that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic.
Is that likely, do you think, here?
It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with, you had a weakened immune system, you lived in poverty in India or Africa, your likelihood of dying was far greater.
And I would just add we saw the same thing with SARS.
And it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine.
This motor has enough power to take you up the hills of San Francisco at about 20 miles per hour, about 30 kilometers an hour, and this battery, this battery right here has about six miles of range, or 10 kilometers, which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the U.S. alone.
I mean, this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go.
Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming, although I'm known to make my dreams come true.
So please join me for a minute of silence.
One, two, three, four, five, six and seven.
Two years later, one -- zoop.
They are those beautiful oblong objects, but quite difficult to make.
Until one day I practiced in front of Francis Brunn, the world's greatest juggler.
It was more interesting; I heard.
So I found some enormous, ridiculous, giant ski boots and then wobbly, wobbly I get on the ropes.
On the high wire, within months, I'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus, except I am not satisfied.
Manhattan no longer spreads its infinity.
At my feet, the path to the north tower -- 60 yards of wire rope.
I was not interested in collecting the gigantic, in breaking records.
Thank you. Thank you.
Well now I must say, it was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel, but I got one.
There was tension in my wire, but I also could feel tension on the ground.
So I grab the dove, and for the second time I send her in the air.
Now the dove, who, now you know, obviously cannot fly, does for the third time a little flop, flop, flop and ends up on the wire behind me.
They had become one, pushing me to triumph.
By inspiring ourselves we inspire others.
And Dr. Terry Erwin, in 1983, called the canopy, "the last biotic frontier."
There are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists -- people who describe and name animals -- have named.
They grow in tropical forests like this one and they also grow in temperate rainforests, that we find in Washington state.
We've done stripping experiments where we've removed mats of epiphytes and looked at the rates of recolonization.
One of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered.
And especially, you know, as a small brown woman in a little college, in the upper northwest part of our country, far away from the areas of power and money, I really have to ask myself, "What can I do about this?
What we do, my students in my lab and I, is we buy Barbies from Goodwill and Value Village, we dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses and we send her out with a canopy handbook.
He saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences in the Pacific Northwest, and created this beautiful sculpture.
This experience of working with Duke also led me to initiate a program called Sound Science.
It's a 265 million dollar industry and it's increasing rapidly.
They were very enthusiastic.
And our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon.
So, although it's a little bit of a fantasy, I think it's also a reality.

They behaved just like the children.
That was not my intention. I was just making these requests as part of research for my first book.
Well, I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain.
Obviously the Church weren't very happy about this, and they tried to suppress it, but what they hadn't counted on was technology, and then they had the printing press, which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply, far and fast, and people would come together in coffee houses, discuss the ideas, plot revolution.
And they're all moving to this central system, this fully connected system, all of them except one. Can you guess which one?
It zooms it off to the appropriate person, it tells you when the time limit is coming to an end, it keeps track of all the correspondence, it posts it up there, and it becomes an archive of public knowledge.
So this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those databases into one place so you can start searching for, you know, his relatives, his friends, the head of his security services.
So I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak. It was amazing. I mean, it was amazing.
He wasn't content with the way the newspapers published it to be safe and legal. He threw it all out there.
And if you don't have skepticism and humility, then it's a really short journey to go from reformer to autocrat, and I think you only have to read "Animal Farm" to get that message about how power corrupts people.
He actually said that, it was a matter of life and death.
Well, to go back to our original story, the parents have panicked. They've locked all the doors.
This is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs I'm going to show you today.
But really the most significant thing, the most profound thing about this picture is that it was taken two days before I was completely paralyzed from the neck down.
There is a problem with scuba though, in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go, and it turns out that depth is about 200 feet.
Scuba divers can't get there, submarines go right on past it.
Now, the deeper you go underwater, the higher the pressure is.
The first limitation is the oxygen -- oxygen toxicity.
The deeper you go, the loopier you get.
I'll admit, it wasn't exactly the smartest of starts, but, you know, you got to start somewhere.
There had to be a better way.
Well, in order to really understand how they do that you have to take off the hood, and look underneath and see what's going on.
And, the other component on a breathing loop is the carbon dioxide absorbent canister.
And that, fittingly enough, is called the diluent gas supply.
It's got all the valves and knobs and things you need to do to inject the right gases at the right time.
And I can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife -- but I want to move on to something that's kind of much more interesting.
It's really a very interesting -- you ever see "The Abyss" where Ed Harris, you know, he's sinking down along the side of the wall?
These are crinoids, sponges, black corals. There're some more fishes.
Look at those ...
The silvertips are the one with the white edges on the fin, and there're also gray reef sharks and some hammerheads off in the distance.
Coconuts! You can get killed by a coconut more likely than killed by a shark.
And, I want to show you a few of the guppies we've found over the years.
It's sort of like sobering up.
Now, this one's pretty cool.
We're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth.
This one was taken at the exact moment I was down there filming those sharks.
The first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet, which is to survive. I call it perpetuation: the survival of the species and survival of ourselves, because they're both about perpetuating the genome.
Because once you're dead, you really can't enjoy anything after that.
on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I'd like to share with you all today.
Looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete, or even a misleading, picture of the child's problems.
Seven-year-old Justin Senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism.
And his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ.
So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder, then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved.
And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen were all about learning something, or knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas.
And that ends with a little clip of my father, of Lou, talking about something that is very dear to him, which is the accidents of life.
It is the capital of the country, and it took 23 years to build, which is something they seem to be very proud of over there.
Roll that tape.
And you know, when I knew him when I was in the office, he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go.
NK: You're proud of it?
NK: No, he's been dead for 25 years.
In that way it is so relevant.
In social aspect of his life he was just like a child, he was not at all matured.
So, my question: are we alone?
Perspectives can be altered.
Would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there inspire us to find ways to survive our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence?
For millennia, we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there.
But, this time not one billion dollars, one billion stars.
These extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments.
It tells us about their past, but detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future.
And that's the length of time that the Earth was lifeless.
We are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process.
We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution, and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story, and perhaps SETI will help as well.
And no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water.
But this is a simple signal, and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals.
Well, to quote: "The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that has plagued our species since its inception.
And this is a technically creative challenge, and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it.
And SETI is a mirror -- a mirror that can show us ourselves from an extraordinary perspective, and can help to trivialize the differences among us.
Yet, the ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change.
This past May was the warmest worldwide on record.
It makes for an exotic and chilly commute.
Yes, I said that with a Q, quadrillion.
We can see the calcium from the world's deserts, soot from distant wildfires, methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon, all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes to this remote and very cold place.
Indeed, we run the risk of making things worse.
As they handle the ice, in fact, they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven, so that, when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen, they can don a fresh pair.
It is a voice of experience.
Now, similarly, the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it, it would be expensive, or we would have done it already, because markets are essentially perfect.
But in the nine years before Drake struck oil, in 1859, at least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared, thanks to fatal competitors, chiefly oil and gas made from coal, to which the whalers had not been paying attention.
And serious competition from Europe, from Korea, and next is China, which will soon be a major net exporter of cars.
That seems to make more sense.
And then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas.
But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned, to happen sooner and with higher confidence, then -- and also to expand choice and manage risk -- then you might like some light-handed public policies that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic.
Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon.
Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles, the cars and light trucks, because we all know the most about those; probably everybody here drives one.
And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that -- well, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car, and it would cost a lot more to make, because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium.
Because these materials could actually absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel, and do so a lot more smoothly.
And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified.
The plant also gets smaller.
Or we could, of course, just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil, or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us.
You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class, in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three.
There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster.
Just turn it over to the private sector, and we have an Internet.
And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before.
Whatever your reason for wanting to do this, whether you're concerned about national security or price volatility -- -- or jobs, or the planet, or your grand-kids, it seems to me that this is an oil endgame that we should all be playing to win.
These people aren't that smart.
We spent two and a half years conducting research; we spent another year and a half in advance development.
And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the United States, after two years, we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children, drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research, and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics, for designing computer-based products -- and, in fact, any kind of products -- for little girls, ages eight to 12.
The other title that we launched is called "Secret Paths in the Forest," which addresses the more fantasy-oriented, inner lives of girls.
And so it's funny to me that these interesting, odd bedfellows have one thing in common: they don't listen to little girls.
Girl 2: Divorced -- parents divorced, maybe.
Girl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters, or brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves.
Rockett: Hi Miko! What's going on?
BL: I'm going to fast-forward to the decision point because I know I don't have a lot of time.
Oops, I turned the wrong way.
It turns out they're really great.
And like Hitler, Goering fancied himself a collector of art.
Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason, which is itself punishable by death.
So they brought him in.
According to his biographer, "He looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world."
And when that was discovered, it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum.
What I mean by this is we don't just respond to things as we see them, or feel them, or hear them.
Few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human.
It's very simple: pour it from an expensive bottle.
These are stimuli I've used in some of my studies.
If you like somebody, they look better to you.
"Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover."
The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars.
So in one of our experiments, we asked people to name a famous person who they adored, a living person they adored.
As my wife put it, "You've washed away the Clooney cooties."
And that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery.
I use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example because there's a young American artist who paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock, and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars -- in large part because she's a very young artist.
The question is: How much would people like Joshua Bell, the music of Joshua Bell, if they didn't know they were listening to Joshua Bell?
So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station.
And how you think about what you're experiencing, your beliefs about the essence of it, affect how it hurts.
The third drops, the fourth, the fifth.
And I'll end with that. Thank you.
Here are some of the things they say prevents cancer: crusts, red pepper, licorice and coffee.
That's what happens at academic conferences.
How do you know that something is good for us or bad for us?
You get a certificate and everything.
"A glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer."
And then they give you advice: "If you eat olive oil and vegetables, you'll have fewer skin wrinkles."
So ideally what you want to do is a trial.
That should always ring alarm bells.
That's a technical term.
And this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placebo against another.
So firstly, trials against placebo: everybody thinks they know that a trial should be a comparison of your new drug against placebo.
You can give the competing drug in too high a dose, so that people get side effects.
And so it's no surprise that overall, industry-funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials.
And there are two different ways that you can spot whether some data has gone missing in action.
So they all cluster together.
This is a drug called reboxetine.
If we remove half of the data, we can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is.
And they spend that money on the promise that this is a drug which will reduce the rate of complications with flu.
But I would say this: I think that sunlight is the best disinfectant.
Start with empathy.
This is what I saw.
And everywhere, were symbols of the Chinese -- everywhere, a constant reminder.
And before we know it, they send in the tanks and then send in the troops, and lots of people are dying, and it's a very, very difficult situation.
Okay, so that's the warm up.
But really, you just want a better life for yourself.
It's because somebody else has a design for your resource.
Come on, they live in big houses, they have big cars, they all have blond hair, blue eyes, they're happy.
I mean, it's not easy; you see a lot of poverty.
You read about it.
You talk about it.
There's something else about them that you see -- they don't see themselves.
And you feel something about that -- of course you do.
And you know that. Americans don't read about this guy.
You know what it means.
And the Americans: "Ah, he's a knucklehead.
Of course you're going to think this.
And you're reading this website.
You see, I, Sam Richards, I know who these guys are.
You don't understand the Americans.
Step outside of your shoes that you're in right now and step back into your normal shoes.
So here's what I want you to do.
This is the scene here.
Put yourself in the shoes of the Americans who caught them.
Can you feel their anger, their fear, their rage at what has happened in their country?
It's also understanding.
And this is what I tell my students: step outside of your tiny, little world.
Attend to other lives, other visions.
It was only in the second half of the 20th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss.
And of course the iron curtains, political walls have come tumbling down.
Never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in China.
People were actually getting poorer than their parents, and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been.
He said, "He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself, without lessening mine.
If you had to choose, which would you rather have: the common disease or the rare disease?
Now we are not there yet, but it is happening.
One idea, one world, one market.
Now, today, less than one-tenth of one percent of the world's population are scientists and engineers.
How many Ramanujans are there in India today toiling in the fields, barely able to feed themselves, when they could be feeding the world?
1996: less than one million new university students in China per year; 2006: over five million.
In fact if you look at world history you can see some reasons for optimism.
We won't make it.
Now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929, trying to forecast future growth for the United States, not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff, not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century.
Oil. Oil. This was a big topic.
The world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today, than ever in the past, because of what I'm talking about.
Spread the ideas. Spread the light.
I had a butterfly period, a snake period, a bird period, a fish period, a cave period and finally and definitively, an ant period.
In so doing, I reached a frontier of biology so strange, so rich, that it seemed as though it exists on another planet.
Consider the fungi -- including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms.
The fact is, we don't know.
What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved, although they're obviously of enormous importance to us.
Some serious biologists, and I count myself among them, have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms, one might -- just might -- find aliens among them.
My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953, while a Harvard graduate student, searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba, ants that shine in the sunlight -- metallic green or metallic blue, according to species, and one species, I discovered, metallic gold.
And the final letter is O, for over-harvesting -- driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing.
Of the 15 percent evaluated, 20 percent are classified as "in peril," that is, in danger of extinction.
So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters, and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk.
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form, science has advanced.
And most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago: to search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it.
And indeed it was a keystone species that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest, from the Mississippi to the Atlantic, from Canada down to the Gulf.
But a lot of other animals weren't saved.
There was sort of a movie made about it recently.
A little bit of film was shot.
Then the question is, can you reassemble, with that genome, the whole bird?
Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway.
You have to figure out exactly what genes matter.
So if he's successful, she won't be the last.
So what they're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive, hardy-looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there to rebuild, over time, with selective back-breeding, the aurochs.
This one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes, but Alberto was confident that cloning has moved along well since then, and this will move ahead, and eventually there will be a population of bucardos back in the mountains in northern Spain.
He then has a way to put the germ plasm into the embryo of a chicken egg so that that chicken will have, basically, the gonads of a falcon.
There were some conservationists, really famous conservationists like Stanley Temple, who is one of the founders of conservation biology, and Kate Jones from the IUCN, which does the Red List.
Here's a couple related examples.
Now there are 880. They're increasing in population by three percent a year.
These have been private meetings so far.
So Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the group that Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz.
Thank you.
I think that's, you know, part of how it'll work.
When I was a kid, I loved to draw, and the most talented artist I knew was my mother, but my mother was addicted to heroin.
And they supported my creative efforts, because my grandfather was a self-made man.
A published author of books came to talk to us about what he did for a living.
My book had a title page.
And so these characters would become my friends.
So from sixth through 12th grade, once, twice, sometimes three times a week, I would take classes at the art museum, and I was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw, other kids who shared a similar passion.
I just couldn't wait to get to that classroom every day.
And so I took this picture, and I handed it to him.
On my 14th birthday, my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever: a drafting table that I have worked on ever since.
And after begging and pleading for Christmas, I got a second-hand video camera, and I instantly started making my own animations on my own, and all throughout high school I made my own animations.
Draw the way you're drawing and keep at it, because you're really good."
I transferred to RISD as a sophomore, and it was there that I took every course that I could on writing, and it was there that I wrote a story about a giant orange slug who wanted to be friends with this kid.
And he said, "Well, who pays you for that?"
And this was from an editor at Random House Children's Books.
Mrs. Alisch was there. Mr. Shilale was there. Mrs. Casey was there.
I have 10 picture books out.
"Punk Farm" and "Lunch Lady" are in development to be movies, so I am a movie producer and I really do think, thanks to that video camera I was given in ninth grade.
So the biggest moment for me, though, my most important job now is I am a dad myself, and I have two beautiful daughters, and my goal is to surround them by inspiration, by the books that are in every single room of our house to the murals I painted in their rooms to the moments for creativity where you find, in quiet times, by making faces on the patio to letting her sit in the very desk that I've sat in for the past 20 years.
First of all, ambience. I have a whole TEDTalk about this.
Let me give you some examples from a couple of areas which I think we all care about: health and education.
There are just huge benefits to come from designing for the ears in our health care.
The children couldn't hear their teachers.
Not so good, is it?
In the U.K., that's more than 10 percent of the school population.
In fact, 65 decibels is the very level at which this big survey of all the evidence on noise and health found that, that is the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction.
We're at last starting to debate this issue, and the benefits that are available for designing for the ears in education, unbelievable.
Where are the office sound planners?
I love that phrase.
Well, the same is true of the music, which my brother and I composed and mapped specifically for Central Park.
This was an experience that stayed with us for a long time, and years later, my brother and I moved back to Washington, D.C., and we started to ask the question, would it be possible, in the same way that The Gates responded to the physical layout of the park, to compose music for a landscape?
This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins.
Currently, my brother and I are working on projects all over the country, but last spring we started a project, here actually at Stanford's Experimental Media Art Department, where we're creating our largest location-aware album to date, one that will span the entirety of Highway 1 here on the Pacific Coast.
Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.
Because, if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear.
Let's start with technology.
Three hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later, what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists.
Something happened along the way.
Because through your mask, they let theirs go.
In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign, suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.
The natural progression of science and art finding each other to better touch and define the human experience.
We design our world. We invent possibilities.
And well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs.
So what I did is, I took all this research and I made it into a -- well, basically it's a product catalog of this one pig, and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back.
Well, that's what the producer says: it's "improving the dough, of course."
It's used in paint for the texture, but also for the glossiness.
So, with the steak, you might drink a beer.
This is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the United States.
It's actually a very low-tech and very high-tech product at the same time.
And they said, "Well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve, because want his product to be associated with pigs."
I have spent my entire life either at the schoolhouse, on the way to the schoolhouse, or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse.
James Comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship.
Well, I said to her, "You know, kids don't learn from people they don't like."
I'm not real good with math, but I was working on it.
And it was difficult. It was awfully hard.
I'll be a better somebody when I leave.
He said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?"
For years I watched my mother take the time at recess to review, go on home visits in the afternoon, buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat, and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn't smell so good.
Will you like all your children? Of course not.
Every child deserves a champion, an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection, and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.
They're now working on their ninth edition, which they began in 1930, and they've reached the letter P.
And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning.
There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type, each of which shapes its sentence.
You've got to extract generalizations so you can produce and understand new sentences.
Well, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object, the noun after the verb.
So, that's an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job.
For example, this construction, the dative, is used not only to transfer things, but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas, as when we say, "She told a story to me" or "told me a story," "Max taught Spanish to the students" or "taught the students Spanish."
He needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time, but it's as if his health is a point in state space that you conceptualize as moving.
Now, I'm sure most of you have seen the movie "Fargo."
No one's fooled.
Now, mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type, and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward.
You have to convey the actual content -- here we get back to the container metaphor.
And you can think of it in terms of a game-theoretic payoff matrix.
On the other hand, with indirect language, if you issue a veiled bribe, then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe, in which case you get the payoff of going free.
And what that means is that I argue.
And when I think about arguments now, I'm talking about, let's call them academic arguments or cognitive arguments, where something cognitive is at stake.
What do I win if I convince you that utilitarianism isn't really the right framework for thinking about ethical theories?
There's a lot of screaming and shouting and winning and losing, and that's not really a very helpful model for arguing but it's a pretty common and entrenched model for arguing.
But there's another twist on this model that I really think is important, namely that when we argue before an audience, sometimes the audience has a more participatory role in the argument, that is, arguments are also audiences in front of juries who make a judgment and decide the case.
We want killer arguments.
It makes it adversarial. It's polarizing.
And let me explain what I mean.
Now, suppose at the end of the day, I've objected, I've questioned, I've raised all sorts of counter-considerations, and in every case you've responded to my satisfaction.
The war metaphor forces us into thinking that you're the winner and I lost, even though I gained.
The argument-as-war metaphor is just, it's a monster.
There's the audience in rhetorical arguments.
Thank you.
And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing.
Or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out into the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us.
And they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes.
This is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration.
After this, they were crawling all over. They would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel.
So it's the conscious emulation of life's genius.
And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has.
That's a geranium pollen.
And at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are.
It's twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics.
This is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms.
That's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic.
That's very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without platinum.
There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics -- when the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps in a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building.
There's a company here in San Francisco called MR3 that is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters to mine waste streams.
That's a mussel you can find in the waters out here, and the threads holding it to a rock are timed; at exactly two years, they begin to dissolve.
But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing, besides all of these adaptations, is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that's going to take care of their offspring.
Yeah. Just like, you know, like the 10-second version of 10, 11 and 12. Because we just -- your slides are so gorgeous, and the ideas are so big, I can't stand to let you go down without seeing 10, 11 and 12.
And that's the growing fertility.
That is, those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places, are not around to tell us about it.
You can't count what you don't see.
And I saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling.
And she said business was even more important for women because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women.
Think about this: Here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets.
I met women running essential oils businesses, wineries and even the country's largest advertising agency.
And if you see the word "entrepreneur," most people think men.
And in the developing world overall, That figure is 40 to 50 percent.
She had come seeking serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she needs to export her chocolates to Africa, Europe, the Middle East and far beyond -- capital that would help her to employ more than the 20 people that she already has working for her, and capital that would fuel her own country's economic climb.
Because -- and I say this as somebody who worked in finance -- 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade.
It is about how we invest and it's about how we see women.
This topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life.
The women in my family are not exceptions.
When we change the way we see ourselves, others will follow.
It was ubiquitous.
For this delight and for this wonder, people rejoiced.
And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.
First of all, I'm a geek.
Wipe it up, throw it away.
Unless you're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on, and then you start to use more energy.
Now, the average house has about 300 megawatt hours of embodied energy in it; this is the energy it takes to make it -- millions and millions of paper towels.
And so this is framing -- lumber, composite materials -- and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that, but it can be a sustainable resource if you use FSC-certified lumber.
And yet, all the press is focused on that.
So what does this mean?
You might want to leave now.
And I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying -- when someone tells you it's impossible.
And in doing so, we were breeding them for parasitism.
They're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America.
And I'll give you an example of that.
Now this is completely unprompted. She had never seen this done before.
There are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have.
Until they finally graduated and left campus, and -- glad to get away, I'm sure -- came back sometime later, and found the crows still remembered them.
Then, collect your cracked nut in safety.
They've learned from their peers. They've learned from their enemies.
This is a vending machine for crows.
So, when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back.
And when they're really good and comfortable with that, we move to the final stage, in which they show up and nothing happens.
And eventually some crow gets a bright idea that, "Hey, there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage, lying around on the ground," hops down, picks it up, drops it in the slot.
Or maybe do search and rescue?
So I thought he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.
These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.
Well, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding -- I do that to steel my nerves -- and so I imitate a train call, holding my hand on my -- 'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see.
You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain -- you know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him.
'Anybody up on that raft with you?' Huck says, 'Yeah.' 'Is he black or white?' 'White.' And they go off.
You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable -- well, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this, I like to inspire people.
So this piece is about a negative imagination.
I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses.
And I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic, who was four months old when I came to jail.
And when she got up, she says she couldn't see.
"I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years, so it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret.
When I started this project called "On the Road: A Search For an American Character" with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America and find it in all its aspects -- bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers, drum majorettes -- but I sort of got tripped on race relations, because my first big show was a show about a race riot.
And that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.
I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie.
Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial.
They became so hilarious, but I was happy for them.
Igniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire.
And this is called "Toughness."
I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking; she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.' "And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet.
Determination's like, you're going to ride till your head hits the back of the dirt.
I mean, I guess it just be like -- I guess it be like the day my brother died.
But there were three problems, three enigmas that I could not solve, and I want to share with you those problems, but most importantly, I think I figured out a proposal for a solution.
So I said, "Forget that. I'm the new Governor.
And on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line, the employees of Electrolux in Greenville, Michigan, had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper.
And he looked at his daughters, and he puts his hand on his chest, and he says, "So, Gov, tell me, who is ever going to hire me?
What in the laboratory that I see out there, the laboratories of democracy, what has happened?
Forty-eight states opted in, creating a national [education] policy from the bottom up.
It's a rounding error on the federal side.
In fact, if you look just at the upper and northern states in the West, they could do geothermal, or you could look at Texas and say, we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid.
And it fosters innovation at the state level in these laboratories of democracy.
What if it all started here at TED?
I'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love, or love to hate, are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender.
Now they've aged out of that demographic, but it's still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don't even take into account viewers of television shows over age 54.
We're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online.
But they get a lot more information about what you do online, what you like, what interests you.
Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising.
Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case.
This is a very important thing to know about people.
They are.
Up goes the bird, out come the words, "Juanito, Juanito, vente a comer mi hijo!"
I'll get a lonely, little sentence with real error in it, "Yeah, I guess I could come inside, but only for a minute."
I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages.
There's about 10 million phage per job.
And I'm on this.
Wow.
And the orgasm reflex can be triggered by a surprisingly broad range of input.
They stimulated her gums with a toothpick, to see if that was doing it.
And I said, "So, could you do it right here?"
And it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people -- a certain kind of dead person, a beating-heart cadaver.
I asked this question to a brain death expert, Stephanie Mann, who was foolish enough to return my emails.
She said, "You get the human subjects review board approval for this one."
He tried everything his friends suggested.
It was called the "upsuck" theory.
Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics, which is also really fun to say.
Did not find any evidence of upsuck.
Sperm that sit around in the body for a week or more start to develop abnormalities that make them less effective at head-banging their way into the egg.
And they had the farmers -- there is posters they put in the barn, and they have a DVD.
You should know, the clitoris of the pig, inside the vagina.
She said -- I have to read you what she said, because I love it.
They use the upper half of the face; the ears are very expressive.
This is basically a penis camera on a motor.
Kinsey thought it was bunk, so he got to work.
My favorite being, "Cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats will distract the female, but not the male."
The fall shattered his right arm, broke every rib that he had, punctured his lung, and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he drifted down the East River, under the Brooklyn Bridge and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry, where passengers on the ferry heard his cries of pain, contacted the boat's captain who contacted the Coast Guard who fished him out of the East River and took him to Bellevue Hospital.
And this is, today, the first time in any sort of public setting I've ever acknowledged the journey that I have been on.
However, I also have reason to believe that many, if not most, of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly.
But not so -- let me demonstrate.
If we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow, we get this, the strong form of the knot.
Now, in keeping with today's theme, I'd like to point out -- and something you already know -- that sometimes a small advantage someplace in life can yield tremendous results someplace else.
I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.
I mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years, and it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler I had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long.
And we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.
I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.
But to go on, here is a very good example to see.
I'll just quote from the specification.
The right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers.
Yeah, it's a -- this one here, that's much better.
I mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all Mr. Haring's various works, in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.
But I think it could still benefit from more discipline.
So after a while I decided to have a little fun, and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space.
Yeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.
Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.
There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.
And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.
I am no designer, nope, no way.
Good design," my dad said, "is about supplying intent."
We had lots of old jazz records lying around the house.
The song is just a given.
All right, exactly 36 years ago this week, that's right, I was in a poorly designed automobile that hit a poorly designed guardrail on a poorly designed road in Pennsylvania, and plummeted down a 200-foot embankment and killed two people in the car.
So I would roll, I'd make no eye contact -- just kinda frown, right?
Look at that!
No, no, no, no, no.
It suggests that someone is driving.
But, if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy, if he was motivated by some random mental illness, he's in a completely different category.
It's what we're supposed to do somehow.
I met the dude. He's a great guy.
What a liberating thought! Yes!
It's something like my accident, right?
Man, I love that thing.
It's a grand idea of design -- a huge idea of design, common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy that emerged in the Classical period.
Today we don't confront the chaos of nature.
That won't do at all.
And I didn't look like a soldier, that's for sure.
His machine: homemade, bolted, rusty, comical.
And I pose this question.
I said, "I know all that -- what day is it?"
To get back to this, to get back to design, and as my daddy suggested a long time ago, "Make the song your own, John.
I then rounded the very bend where his blue truck, heavy with four tons of floor tiles, had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner of the minibus where I sat.
I flew too, my head bobbing on broken bones, and when I landed, I was a quadriplegic.
On this xeroxed piece of paper, the crash had not yet happened.
Many years passed.
But what to get the man who broke your fucking neck?
Were all of us the results of things done to us, done for us, the infidelity of a parent or spouse, money inherited?
The frequent furl of five fingers, the chips in my teeth come from biting at all the many things a solitary hand cannot open.
Many cried.
I drove off and returned at 4:30, thankful to the minaret up the road that helped me find my way back.
Abed then rose and turned on the TV so that I wouldn't be alone when he left the room, and returned with polaroids of the crash and his old driver's license.
I'd hoped for something simpler: to exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way.
He'd lived an unholy life before the crash, and so God had ordained the crash, but now, he said, he was religious, and God was pleased.
"It is a pity," he said, "that the police in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers."
And so 27 violations -- driving through a red light, driving at excessive speed, driving on the wrong side of a barrier, and finally, riding his brakes down that hill -- reduced to one.
But it was hard for me to relate to one who had so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing, to one whose life was so unexamined that he said he thought two people had died in the crash.
I wished to tell him that, in the end, our mandate is clear: We have to rise above bad fortune.
But I didn't say these things to Abed.
I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved, on lower power, which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids.
They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions, what facial expressions you're making.
Oh, it's so sad.
And then I started Hanson Robotics, which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing.
So we put his writings, letters, his interviews, correspondences, into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.
More than cars or the Internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about, the technology you're using the most almost every day is this, your tush.
Someone invited me to a meeting, but couldn't manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting, and said, "I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then?"
And second, and probably the more reflective one, is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they're really not that way.
I think we have a situation here.
Each of those TEDTalks has an average length of about 2,300 words.
Or "Living in existential vacuum; it sucks."
For example, Dan Pink's talk on motivation, which was pretty good if you haven't seen it: "Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning."
So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars.
He always proves us wrong.
Here are some of my favorites.
Again, there were some misunderstandings.
I wanted to have a thousand TEDTalks summarized into just six words -- which would be a 99.9997 percent reduction in content.
A few months ago the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever.
I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts.
That, much as the gravitational pull of the Earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward, the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space.
What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed?
When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up, look at what they found.
So hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three key things about string theory.
But there's a cost to this elegant unification, because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work.
The challenge is we don't know the shape of the extra dimensions.
But others turned this issue on its head, taking us to the possibility of a multiverse.
It's that the right question to ask is, why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we've measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there?
We're used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe.
Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn't exist.
You see, when we speak of the Big Bang, we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward.
Each of these universes has extra dimensions.
Going further, if there are other universes, the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide.
Now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era, like ours, attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies.
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon.
On the other hand, we now can understand how old the universe is.
And so a year ago, I showed this off at a computer show called E3.
Dimitri, just waggle your arm around.
He's moved from London to New England, over in America.
Very simple at the start.
Why not just, instead of pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joypad, why not use your body just to lean on the chair -- again, relaxed?
Peter Molyneux: What are you going to do, Dimitri?
It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago.
We're actually teaching him.
Female Voice: See if you can inspire him to do any better.
But this is going to be an introduction, and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use.
Now's a chance for Dimitri to kind of reassure and calm Milo down.
Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to.
PM: So after three-quarters of an hour, he recognizes you.
But for me, this is a wonderful opportunity where technology, at last, can be connected with, where I am no longer restrained by the finger I hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game's concerned -- or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book.
She was walking to work one day in April, 1992, in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank.
and passing her son to someone through a window.
I learned so much about myself.
I see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia.
Now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out with the sheer number, I want you just for a second to think of a million people.
There was no kind of compensation for, you're a Tutsi, you're a Hutu, you might have killed my mother, you might have killed my father.
And I said, "Well, I have to see." It was 2004 which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq, "I have to see, I have to see what is happening here.
I'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor, and I can't tell you the times of how helpless I've felt to have people dying in front of me, and I couldn't save them.
And all I can really do is hope, not to policymakers or politicians, because as much as I'd like to have faith that they read my words and do something, I don't delude myself.
So we got a little snippet of a thought, and we could see it in front of us.
My son calls this "making popcorn while listening to a badly-tuned A.M. station."
And that's exactly what we did 10 years ago.
Think about that.
Well, she did that because she, at that time, had acquired a new arm.
You can just build a computational body, an avatar, a monkey avatar.
And he has to select one because only one carries the reward, the orange juice that they want to get.
And yet, they can find them by tactile discrimination, and they can press it and select it.
How far can we take it?
This is CB1 fulfilling its dream in Japan under the control of the brain activity of a primate.
This same mechanism, we hope, will allow these patients, not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make and translate them into movements of this new body, but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls.
Look, you all are very well traveled; this is TEDGlobal after all.
Dai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts.
She still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors.
She went to vocational school for accounting.
The village became a real standout.
Well, let me ask you this question.
In fact, demographers have shown that there are anywhere between 60 million and 100 million missing females in the current population.
From one to five, girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate than boys, in all of India.
So research has shown, if you look at people who live under two dollars a day -- one metric of poverty -- two percent of that take-home pay goes to this basket here, in education.
On this side was men, and then the barrier, and this side was women.
Now, modern slavery: according to State Department rough statistics, there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number -- that are trafficked across international borders.
Around the world, one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth.
The baby died, and she ended up with a fistula.
Because she had some damage to her nerves, she crawled all the way -- 30 miles -- to that doorstep, half dead.
With economic opportunity, it can be transformative.
At the time, there was a microlending group in the village that gave her a 65-dollar loan.
Which brings me to the final element, which is education.
Heifer sent two goats to Africa.
Two years ago, she graduated from Connecticut College.
You know, people say how half of all water well projects, a year later, are failed.
And a movement of men and women is what's needed to bring about social change, change that will address this great moral challenge.
Throughout her time there, she was strong, she was steadfast.
So, here's the cause.
It's just that, whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light, your language relies on pulses, discrete pulses, of sound.
Even today, we know that there are words we cannot use, phrases we cannot say, because if we do so, we might be accosted, jailed, or even killed.
Why not? I mean, that's what we do.
These upright apes evolved on the African savanna about two million years ago, and they made these splendid hand axes that fit wonderfully into your hands.
We can learn by watching other people and copying or imitating what they can do.
Now to many commentators, cumulative cultural adaptation, or social learning, is job done, end of story.
Social learning really is visual theft.
So if we'd chosen that path, our evolutionary path would have led into the forest -- and been a short one indeed.
And to see why, consider two scenarios from early in our evolution.
Okay, now replay this scene now, and you're approaching the one who has language.
And this is exactly what the archeological record shows.
As we spread out around the world, we developed thousands of different languages.
They're far closer together than that."
Okay, this tendency we have, this seemingly natural tendency we have, towards isolation, towards keeping to ourselves, crashes head first into our modern world.
The European Union is now spending over one billion euros annually translating among their 23 official languages.
One of them always drives the other extinct.
Thank you.
What we know about this FOXP2 and Neanderthals is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths -- who knows.
That people have just sort of figured out about it, and now with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something, we may be on the road to a solution.
So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible, that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line.
Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care.
And it's this stuff in the middle here, which is what you do if you don't stop the emissions quickly enough.
You could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates -- into the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere, where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet.
But you'll notice that in the upper bar, which is the lower atmosphere and the surface, it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit.
And there are times you might like to do something quick.
Gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn't do a very good compensation.
The one new thing is this essay.
And in fact, he had some ideas to make them go away.
So it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up, that already have this effect.
And of course, we may be wrong -- this hasn't all been peer reviewed, we're in the middle of thinking about it -- but so far, it seems good.
The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage.
We have no global governance.
And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it -- I do not -- but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously.
It's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage.
Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this.
That's an absolutely possible scenario.
But you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer.
My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem, and I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard.
That the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about, is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions -- but also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control, whether we like it or not.
But there are multiple truths attached to every image, depending on the creator's intention, the viewer and the context in which it is presented.
In this context I'll just show you a few.
And then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground.
This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room, a contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.
And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency, and had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.
But stuff did feel like it could have been taken 30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era and hadn't necessarily progressed.
And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film.
This is the Death Star.
It's called the World Church of God.
However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.
A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images.
He was convicted by an all-white jury of rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.
And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place to which he's never been, but changed his life forever.
Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club, and served 11 years of a death sentence.
Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia.
Forty-two million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2010.
This actually became my creative obsession.
And you can arrange these things as kind of more for encampments and more of a city grid type layout, or you can circle the wagons, essentially, and form these circular pods out of them, which give you this semi-private communal area for people to actually spill out into so they're not actually trapped inside these units.
So the first idea I had, initially, was just to go the federal and state governments and go, "Here, take it, for free."
They actually built three prototypes for us by hand.
Hopefully very soon we will be there, because we are destined, obsessed with making it real.
So what you're looking at right now is the Earth.
And the cool thing is, we actually created 3D models for a number of these spacecraft, so if you want to visit any of these, all you need to do is double-click on them.
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, there.
And just being able to visit different places and go through different times, we have data from 1950 to 2050.
It's actually running at real rate right now, one second per second, and in fact, Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at I think it's 38,000 miles per hour.
There's a whole story to tell here.
And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there.
I put up a somewhat dour Darwin, but a very happy chimp up there.
Prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug.
And the World Health Organization predicts by the year 2020 that depression will be the second largest cause of disability.
So for example, we're born loving the taste of something sweet and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter.
Cortisol floods the brain; it destroys hippocampal cells and memory, and can lead to all kinds of health problems.
We've come away from the Freudian gloom, and people are now actively studying this.
So that the body can both look for opportunity and also protect itself from danger, at the same time.
Babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter.
We have basically at least two systems here, and they both are very ancient.
So they assumed this must be, you know, the brain's orgasmatron.
And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips to the zygomatic major.
There is something very restorative about nature, and it's part of how we are tuned.
And I think this has been a really tremendous problem that goes against our biology and nature, and hasn't made us any happier at all.
So for example we have three systems that underlie reproduction, because it's so important.
We are very acutely aware of our social status and always seek to further and increase it.
You see mental distress going up with lower income.
That whole dopamine-wanting system takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system.
"There is only one question: How to love this world?"
One was a passion for rodents.
We're talking '95 now.
There's a target somewhere here.
Very, very simple.
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.
If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs, by the way.
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.
And if, however, you are detected very early, diagnosed early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.
You have a cassette with 10 samples.
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils, customs applications, detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology.
It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks, and doing that with a local resource, plenty available.
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world.
This is what I spoke about in the last TED.
But what Rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons, maybe about 20 percent of them, will also fire when I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action.
Well, why is that important?
And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system, which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions.
And that is, there are mirror neurons, just as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch.
Well, that's because you've got receptors in your skin, touch and pain receptors, going back into your brain and saying "Don't worry, you're not being touched.
You've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings.
So, here you have my last slide.
HP: YR: The only problem with masking it with Chinese Mandarin is I can only speak this paragraph, which I have learned by heart when I was visiting in China.
So my artwork is about identity and language, challenging common assumptions based on how we look like or where we come from, gender, race, class.
Now, water can flow or it can crash.
HP: A few years ago, in order to make this video for my artwork, I shaved off all my hair so that I could grow it back as my father had it when he first emigrated from India to the U.K. in the 1960s.
He talks like this now.
He then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well, but in a woman's voice.
I learned this from Spider-Man.
And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself.
That's about a 50th of a millimeter.
"So, what are pollen's properties?" I hear you ask.
This one I particularly like.
That tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen.
So, if you have a pollen sample, then in principle, you should be able to tell where that sample came from.
Four very different habitats might look similar, but they've got very different pollen signatures.
There is an invisible beauty all around us, each grain with a story to tell ...
And as we have watched women conquer breast cancer through the breast cancer campaign, this is what we need to do now with heart.
And that's too short of a time period for all the different risk factors that we know to change.
We often can't think of a young woman who has heart disease.
We have effective therapies now.
She had to look like a man.
And they're just passed.
It told us about hormone replacement therapy.
Why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease?
There's a big clot in the middle of the artery.
And because of the common knowledge of how women and men get fat.
And so the yellow is the fatty plaque, and panel A is a man.
Now what are the implications of that?
And we're about two and a half years into a five-year study.
What are the downstream consequences then, when female-pattern heart disease is not recognized?
There's been wonderful news also about studying women, finally, in heart disease.
Or do you want these guys, that look like they're out to lunch?
So just like the breast cancer story, doing research, getting awareness going, it works, you just have to get it going.
And in fact, it probably won't.
They have put their money where their mouth is and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns.
Good morning everybody.
What does that even mean?
Well, the heart beats, rhythmically, tirelessly, faithfully.
Let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be.
In a sense, tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here, because structural engineers build bridges and big things, computer engineers, computers, but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves.
It begs the question: shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship to include the ecosystem of our own bodies?
And we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system.
Countless moments of unsolicited natural moments, not posed moments, are captured there, and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them.
So you've all, I'm sure, seen time-lapse videos where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time.
Over the course of the 24 months, the first two years that we really focused on, this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order.
And we would plot the relative length of the utterances.
We're not looking at -- think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house.
We're now on the couch, looking out through the window at cars passing by.
He's leaving red ink behind.
This is the wordscape for the word water, and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen.
Three of the key people in this project, Philip DeCamp, Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here.
You have the event structure, the common ground that the words are about, coming out of the television feeds; you've got the conversations that are about those topics; and through semantic analysis -- and this is actually real data you're looking at from our data processing -- each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal.
And if you put them on one plain, a second plain is where the content lives.
It's not one way.
One last example from this data: Sometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special.
And then I went on to reflect, "Isn't it amazing, this entire database, all these recordings, I'm going to hand off to you and to your sister" -- who arrived two years later -- "and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments that you could never, with your biological memory, possibly remember the way you can now?"
It's a cluttered environment; it's natural life.
Oh, boy.
These sketches brought to life the key ideas, the portraits, the magic moments that we all experienced last year.
But it also acts like a kind of relay station that re-radiates and redirects information to many other parts of the brain.
A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream.
So the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways.
And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas.
And the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence.
You'll be able to figure that out.
So making images meaningful has three components.
It was all just gone.
You can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows -- certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill.
And those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops.
It looks a little phallic, but after all, it's a bathroom.
Then, this is a deadbolt. It's a fence from a 1930s shaper, which is a very angry woodworking machine.
Then, this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle-class front door in America.
Don't put it in the foyer.
What it means is, for every perception we have, it needs to tally with the one like it before, or we don't have continuity, and we become a little bit disoriented.
And you'd have to start a new category, right between cell phones and chocolate.
We'll go, "Ooh, that's nice."
On the one hand, we have an Apollonian perspective, which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect.
I feature organic process.
So now we have standardized materials.
Well, that's just a myth.
He said, "No, no. I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work."
So we all have in our head the perfect house, the American dream, which is a house, the dream house.
It out-gasses formaldehyde so much so that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger.
One is that all the professionals, all the tradesmen, vendors, inspectors, engineers, architects all think like this.
And pretty soon, we're swilling that stuff by the lake-ful, by the billions of gallons.
So if I'm eating spaghetti, and I know I'm alone, I can eat like a backhoe.
I'll bet all your shoes match.
We do what that group does that we're trying to identify with.
And so that happens in the building industry as well.
And it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal, terrifying parts of ourselves and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity, but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources.
And your instinct is to say, "Why don't you suck an egg?"
What do you think, honey?"
And it raises an existential question, which is, if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness, why am I not visible in the photograph, and where is this time and place?
I'm put on full life support, and I have a massive stroke, and my brain drops into a coma.
It's so unpredictable and so fragile.
And then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle.
And what I've learned since that event and during my recovery is that consciousness is under threat on this planet in ways it's never been under threat before.
The World Health Organization tells us that depression is the number one disease on Earth in terms of years lived with disability.
The average teenager sends 3,300 texts every [month].
But if you look into the eye of consciousness, that single eye you can see, I'm looking down, but let me tell you how I felt at that point.
Neurological damage, 10 years of rehab, requires a long-term perspective.
I thought there were miraculous elements, but I also didn't think it was right that one should have to struggle and search for answers when this is a pandemic within our society.
I'm not a doctor, so I'm not going to talk about the various subtests.
It meant that when I was given two and a half hours to take a test that anyone here would take in 50 minutes, I might score an F.
But they asked one question. They said, "Is this repeatable?"
Second aspect: I still had crushing migraine headaches.
If that sounds like a very, very strange thing to say and rather a bold statement -- How can the jaw affect the entire body? -- let me simply point out to you, if I ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk, how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand?
That's basically it.
Communication, the next C. This is critical.
Five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin.
Is this science fiction? No, because I'm wearing the first application of this technology.
And during my time in coma, she had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix.
I don't know what I had in my mind.
Simon Lewis: I knew when I was timing this that there wouldn't be time for me to do anything about -- Well this is it. This is the control unit.
This down here, if the camera can see that, that is a small antenna.
It works.
You'd think, there's plenty of paralyzed people in the world, but the audience is too small, and the amount of research, the time it takes, the FDA clearances, the payback time is too long for V.C. to be interested.
And I put them together, so that in each pair of country, one has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data.
This country over here is China. This is India.
The error margin is narrow. Here I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years.
All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families.
And the United States up there is getting for longer life, keeping family size. And in the '80s now, they give up communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life. And today, we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974, by the end of the war.
This is Africa. 10 percent the world population, most in poverty.
And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival.
In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.
Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America.
And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower.
Now that's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was 1960. If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda.
And the public is there, and the Internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively.
A search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around?
And that's a quite clever guy, huh?
We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the Internet users per 1,000.
It's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it? These countries are lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data. Thank you very much.
I was at the University of Chicago, in my third year, and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago let you in after two years of high school.
Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book called "What is Life?" by the great physicist, Schrodinger.
So I went to Indiana, which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics, and besides, they had a really good basketball team.
And this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist, and after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes.
And there I met Francis Crick.
So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix.
You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts.
And so, one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling, and he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts.
And so Bragg said, "Build models."
And so Crick and I, you know, started building models, and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough.
So I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing, and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions.
So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it, because you didn't have any other scheme.
It didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs.
And on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie.
Well, at that time -- I should go back.
And we use their technique.
Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one.
I mean, big piece at the molecular level.
And yet, in the controls there were three.
We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar; there's a relationship.
And as a result, the patent troll can claim that they won the case.
Now I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit, but one-by-one they settled out of the case, even though -- and this is important -- none of these companies infringed on this patent -- not a one of them.
with no employees.
Well during the settlement process, when we received our copy, I struck it.
Secondly, make it clear from the beginning that either you have no money at all or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll than actually giving them the money.
Patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy than any domestic or foreign terrorist organization in history every year.
So unfortunately I'm not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem.
"I haven't heard from my dad in years."
As long as they have infrastructure, mentorship and resources, they can build what they need, not only to survive, but to thrive.
"Why not?" the girls asked.
Most of the girls doubted the possibility of that, and said, "Are you crazy?
They hugged.
So we brought in Flip cams, and we had them look at the Flip cams and just interview each other -- their messages, their thoughts.
Because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought: What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world?
This is a great technology.
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually, in this iron lung to breathe for them.
And it happened so fast in the United States, however, that even just last month Jon Stewart said this: Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active?
But just last year, we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio.
But the message was very clear.
So we're looking for a permanent solution, and this is where we get lucky.
It's been tried six times in the last century, and it's been successful exactly once.
And there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries.
So you can't see the enemy most of the time, and as a result, we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox.
And they also have to dodge bullets, because we have got to operate during shaky cease-fires and truces to try and vaccinate children, even in areas affected by conflict.
And in each of those, it was only part of the country.
So things were looking very exciting, and then about five years ago, this virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back.
Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds, it's a false premise.
This leg, his right leg, now takes an awful beating because he has to half-crawl, because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends, keep up with his brothers and sisters, than to get up on his crutches and walk.
We think children deserve better.
But as we tried these extraordinary things, as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics, we went back to the vaccine -- it's a 50-year-old vaccine -- and we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine, so that when they finally get to these kids, we can have a better bang for our buck.
So this morning at about seven o'clock, I decided that we'd try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again, so that you could see something that's just unfolding today, which proves that the impossible is possible.
And in the last six months, we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history.
Now we're in tough times economically.
Help us build the momentum so that very soon every child, every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio-free life forever.
They're going to be the tough ones.
But when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times -- 20, 30 cents to reach a child -- that's not very much money.
And I know, in the light of human suffering and poverty and even climate change, one would wonder, why worry about a few cats?
Now I'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique, very, very special, individualistic and often seductive female characters.
She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us, sat next to us, shivering, with her back towards Dereck, and looking out.
Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent, but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.
Well then we hit a deep depression, and we seriously submerged the vehicle.
And surprisingly, it became a cult film.
Sleep deprivation is extreme.
And you can see the start of it here.
This is about couples working together, and so I do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.
DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage, because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.
So what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique.
They ended up sleeping for hours.
BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000.
DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.
A new male comes into the area and takes over the pride, and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.
BJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now, it is all about critical awareness.
BJ/DJ: Thank you very much.
It postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel -- mutually undetectable except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments.
The history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms, as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe.
Why, then, do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable?
He stood up, and moved out from behind his desk.
Unaided human intuition schooled in Middle World finds it hard to believe Galileo when he tells us a heavy object and a light object, air friction aside, would hit the ground at the same instant.
In a desert plain in Tanzania, in the shadow of the volcano Ol Donyo Lengai, there's a dune made of volcanic ash.
But here is the bombshell: You weren't there.
The nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are.
There's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength.
Middle World -- the range of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with -- is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see as light of various colors.
Evolution in Middle World has not equipped us to handle very improbable events; we don't live long enough.
I don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that, because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe.
We'd be different, our characters would be different, if our neuro-anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different.
Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans, it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate, like Basil Fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole.
My dad was a lawyer.
I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder, eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed.
One day, I was lying in bed watching CNN, when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR2 robot.
All of us have disabilities in one form or another.
With a little practice, I became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own.
Chad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside, I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California 3,000 miles away.
We're providing affordable, off-the-shelf robot platforms such as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars, the Suitable Technologies beam, only 17,000 dollars, along with open-source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do.
Our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe.
Now, cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water, as you can see there.
As you can see with your own eyes.
We can also use cymatics for healing and education.
Then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake.
And if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself.
Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another.
My TED wish. There's a vital story that needs to be told and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era.
Being a monolingual American, I obviously don't know what the phrase means.
Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao.
And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine.
As far as national representation, 11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter.
They looked at their local population.
You click on that cookout tag, there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it.
And Negroponte says this is crazy.
If I walk into a store in the United States, it's very, very easy for me to buy water that's bottled in Fiji, shipped at great expense to the United States.
We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world.
It's extremely lumpy.
It's getting more connected.
And she made a cartogram, which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news casts looked at for a month.
And you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe.
We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese, and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world.
We started in 2004.
And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren't actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country.
Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this.
They look for the most interesting content in the English language.
When we look for information online, we basically have two strategies.
You need a guide.
I think what's great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for deejays to reach a wider audience.
And when you look at this image, you might find yourself going, "Why would I conceivably care about this?"
These bridge figures, I'm pretty well convinced, are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web.
He trains with them for a week, and he plays a match with them.
It's not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world.
So little Billy goes to school, and he sits down and the teacher says, "What does your father do?"
All of them, however, including myself, as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road, feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts, feel as though we have become profoundly diminished.
In Afghanistan, for example, we haven't just had one election or two elections. We've gone through three elections, presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find?
We went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned from Bosnia was that elections held too early enshrined sectarian violence, enshrined extremist parties, so in Iraq in 2003 the decision was made, let's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in voter education. Let's invest in democratization.
We need to get away from feeling, in the same way, human rights matters because of the other things it brings, or women's rights matters for the other things it brings.
But if we're really to make democracy vigorous again, if we're ready to revivify it, we need to get involved in a new project of the citizens and the politicians.
Our societies have never been so educated, have never been so energized, have never been so healthy, have never known so much, cared so much, or wanted to do so much, and it is a genius of the local.
In other words, if democracy is to be rebuilt, is to become again vigorous and vibrant, it is necessary not just for the public to learn to trust their politicians, but for the politicians to learn to trust the public.
So, let me present the question to you: If our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie, you should ask yourself, how often do you eat apple pie, versus how often do you eat Chinese food. Right?
What is this?
Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste, so they're not as sweet as our version.
I love this dish.
In fact, the Chinese had their own version of broccoli, which is called Chinese broccoli, but right now, what -- they've now discovered American broccoli, and are importing it as a, sort of, exotic delicacy.
Showed them all the pictures of General Tso Chicken that I showed you, and they're like, we don't know this dish.
And according to New York Times, in 1904, there was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town, and "the city has gone 'chop suey' mad."
Now back then, the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food.
And as a matter of fact, then, this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country So, with sentiments like these, the Chinese Exclusion Act was sort of passed between 1882 and 1902, the only time in American history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity.
So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights.
And even the Brits have their own version.
So, let's take a step back, and kind of, understand what is to be appreciated in America.
So, like, OK, maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know, like, it was a diamond, or, you know, diagonal.
Yeah. So, I went and started looking.
They did chicken pot pie, they did fried chicken, and then they finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.
We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux: sort of an open source thing, right, where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system, that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food, you know, depending on the region.
Last time, I talked about death and dying.
Finally, in about the sixteenth century, a physician whose name was Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim, called Paracelsus, a name probably familiar to some people here -- -- good, old Paracelsus found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion.
And they thought, "Well, we've got electricity, we'll plug somebody into the wall.
So they did that.
It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics, but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s that electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective in the treatment of depression.
And patients' rights groups seemed to get very upset about the kinds of things that they would witness.
There are, I'm sure, enough divorced people in this room to know about the hostility, the anger, who knows what.
Well, you're in a university medical center, where everybody knows everybody, and it's perfectly clear to my colleagues, so my referrals began to decrease.
But it wasn't that simple. Because by the time I got out of that unit, I was not functional at all.
They tried every medication available in those days.
You've seen this painting by Edvard Munch, The Scream. Every moment was a scream.
I really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression, and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it.
Six didn't work. Seven didn't work.
It was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected and I could think clearly.
And things got better and better, and within three or four months, I was discharged from that hospital, and I joined a group of surgeons where I could work with other people in the community, not in New Haven, but fairly close by.
It's been, as I said, close to 30 years.
That I am someone who has drunk, drank, drunk of the bitter dregs of near-disaster in childhood and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened.
You can be thrown off the track.
Thank you.
And it's technological, so it can do things like microelectronics, and maybe photonics do.
The silk worm does a remarkable thing: it uses these two ingredients, protein and water, that are in its gland, to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection -- so comparable to technical fibers like Kevlar.
The recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do.
And we can store information that's film with water and protein.
And so the material can assume a lot of formats.
So for instance, if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle, we do microneedle arrays.
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap.
Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats, in principle, can be implanted and disappear.
Silk, during its self-assembly process, acts like a cocoon for biological matter.
And so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have, that they're programmably degradable.
Some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields.
I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data.
It can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style, over longer-term to different communities or audiences, children versus adults, different cultures.
And the rest of you, you still count, you still matter.
Right, so, a doctor says to his patient, "I have bad news and worse news.
"Come on buddy, I have the toe clippers right here.
The operator says, "Just take it easy.
Any of you like television? Audience: Yes.
So thank you all for being a part of it.
Stick with the people you know.
Because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries.
Our social lives in the future depend on that.
They produce sameness.
A more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance, where at any given point in time, with any single person, I am both close and distant from that individual, all as a function of what I need to do right now.
Whether you're a political party insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not, whether you're the government protecting social institutions like marriage and restricting access of those institutions to the few, whether you're a teenager in her bedroom who's trying to jostle her relations with her parents, strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way to new kinds of relations.
Thank you.
He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance.
There was, however, an incident I'm going to tell you about, that perhaps could have led me suspect something.
I remained under the blankets. He entered my room, sat on the corner of the bed, and he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head, and when he saw me he started laughing.
And indeed, I was very far from the mark.
And later, I told myself that one day I would have to question him.
His parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor.
His family was Jewish, so they were hounded.
As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks?
All the movements stopped at falsifying.
This sense of responsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 -- and also his guilt for being a survivor, since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not -- stayed with him all his life.
How can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night?
And then he would not come.
After the Algerian war, at the heart of the international resistance movements, his name circulated and the whole world came knocking at his door.
My father made false papers for the dissidents against Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece, and even in France.
Anyhow, nobody would have followed them, except for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage.
Thank you.
This is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years.
You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it.
The forth pressure is surprise, the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old paradigm, that ecosystems behave linearly, predictably, controllably in our -- so to say -- linear systems, and that in fact, surprise is universal, as systems tip over very rapidly, abruptly and often irreversibly.
And I can tell you, you enter the disciplinary research in each of these, you find something remarkably important, the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves, that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet, the decade when we have to bend the curves.
The system suddenly, very surprisingly, loses 30 to 40 percent of its summer ice cover.
You know, you don't want to stand there.
It may surprise you that it's not only climate.
What you see here in black line is the safe operating space, the quantified boundaries, as suggested by this analysis.
Is then sustainable development utopia?
But is it happening anywhere?
But again, a crisis, new partnerships, actors locally, transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning.
Well, interestingly, and based on my work and others in Africa, for example, we've shown that even the most vulnerable small-scale rainfall farming systems, with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts, sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients from toilets back to farmers' fields, and innovations in tillage systems, we can triple, quadruple, yield levels on current land.
So there is -- no doubt -- opportunity here, and we can list many, many examples of transformative opportunities around the planet.
Thank you.
When you think about -- you know, creativity has a lot to do with causality too.
You didn't trust information very much.
They were in tuxedos, and fighting. It was very ugly.
But I -- they didn't let me do it, so I just -- you know, they would only let me do other things.
This is the Ashanti joystick.
I wanted to take that into the realm of images, and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.
I had a chance to go to Florence, in -- I think it was '94, and I saw Ghiberti's "Door of Paradise."
And they would look at it -- "Ah, it's a pencil drawing."
These always end up being a photograph at the end, or more like an etching in this case.
These are -- -- Thank you. This is "Valentina, the Fastest."
And Jackson Pollock also.
I bought a computer, and [they] told me it had millions of colors in it.
I ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's "Haystacks."
I was more interested in the things in between, you know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.
So they're like perfect actors.
My time is nearly up.
And these mutations accumulate approximately as a function of time.
So what has now happened in the last few years is that there are account technologies around that allow you to see many, many pieces of DNA very quickly.
Yet the people inside Africa have more genetic variation.
And since there are many genetic variants, and they have different such gradients, this means that if we determine a DNA sequence -- a genome from one individual -- we can quite accurately estimate where that person comes from, provided that its parents or grandparents haven't moved around too much.
Perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine existed.
This may be surprising, because we can, of course, look at these people and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from.
There were other forms of humans around, most famously perhaps, Neanderthals -- these robust forms of humans, compared to the left here with a modern human skeleton on the right -- that existed in Western Asia and Europe since several hundreds of thousands of years.
Did we mix or not?
Then, significantly more often, does a Neanderthal match the European rather than the African.
And it was well enough preserved so we could determine the DNA from this individual, even to a greater extent than for the Neanderthals actually, and start relating it to the Neanderthal genome and to people today.
So from studying these genomes of extinct humans, we're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like when modern humans started coming out of Africa.
They spread across Africa also, of course, and there were older, earlier forms of humans there.
We cannot predict the future.
So we have created a very disruptive structure which mimics the design of bone, or a skeleton, which occurs in nature.
So we see a clear need of active health promotion, especially in the case of the old people.
It will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very complex technology.
This here is an equal bracket for the same purpose.
So we see a bottom-up approach here, because all the information, as I said, are inside the DNA.
So how might the airplane of the future look?
We know the meaning of their actions even before they happen.
They didn't talk. But most of all, they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them, from their environment and from the people.
They orient to the caregiver.
And they learn soon enough, even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want.
You would do something, because it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get a reaction.
Now, most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people.
There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled, but there are those that are gifted.
In the U.S. alone, maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars, and you know what? Most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled, individuals who need wrap-around services, services that are very, very intensive, and those services can cost in excess of 60 to 80,000 dollars a year.
So this is our view of autism.
How do we enter that feeling of resonance, how do we enter another person's being?
Well, we created those measures, and here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention.
Well, we took a construct from our pediatrician friends, the concept of growth charts.
It's almost as if that stimulus, you, you're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives.
We need to be able to work with the families, to support the families, to manage those first years with them. We need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment, because those treatments are going to change these children's and those families' lives.
Because after all, they learn about the world almost like about it, rather than learning how to function in it.
You do some routine refresher training, and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you.
Then you take off.
Then they give you, "Get ready."
And this was that Tuesday morning in September, and it was pretty nice outside.
I have no idea whether it makes any difference, but he seemed to make sense, and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong.
You can't delay that much.
And as soon as I hit, the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed.
When we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed.
But in my first 25 years of career, I had a bunch of different experiences.
Sort of leadership by humiliation.
More importantly, the force that I led was spread over more than 20 countries.
So we had to get complex intelligence together, we had to line up the ability to act.
It was men, women, young, old -- not just from military; from different organizations, many of them detailed to us just from a handshake.
It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise, because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot, that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore.
I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces.
And you have to watch and take care of each other.
And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger.
That was my journey.
Thank you.
I was interested in the idea of why and how I could create a new story, a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world.
And in the course of the exhibition -- which was contentious, controversial and ultimately, for me, life-changing in my sense of what art could be -- a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other.
And, in thinking about that, then my second project, the second question I ask is: Can a museum be a catalyst in a community?
And I bring this up because it's important to locate this practice in history.
To this end, the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions, all titled with an F -- Freestyle, Frequency and Flow -- which have set out to discover and define the young, black artists working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years.
I am continually amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be.
Now, where, perhaps, does this end up right now?
Thank you.
We focus primarily on the planet's environment, but we also address issues of global development, international conflict, responsible use of emerging technologies, even the rise of the so-called Second Superpower and much, much more.
We have the tools: we saw a hint of that a moment ago, and we're coming up with new ones all the time.
Simple technologies, like wall-mounted devices that display how much power your household is using, and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights -- these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint.
But my favorite example has to be the global response to the SARS epidemic in 2003, 2004, which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus.
The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either, from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government, to the Blairwatch Project in the UK, keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press.
Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet: putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds, from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures.
But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems.
Over the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable, Linux-based mobile phones, and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project.
Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act, designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs.
We'd have a far better -- far better knowledge of what's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of government sensor nets alone.
Nobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together, making use of technological innovations and human communities alike, we might just be able to fix it ourselves.
On top of that, those are the places from where trouble comes.
This boy here in the middle of central India -- this is in a Rajasthan village, where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process, they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly.
So I said, "Yeah, I'll leave it here for two months.
I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo, from the late Arthur C. Clarke, who said, "I want to see what's going on."
Boy: ... just mention, I play games like animals, and I listen to music.
And all over India, at the end of about two years, children were beginning to Google their homework.
So in 2006, I bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to Newcastle.
So I left them with it.
It took me three years to publish that.
So their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent, which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances.
What is that? Can you do that again? Can you show me some more?'" She did that for two months.
Remember, from the Hole in the Wall.
They used everything that they knew -- news groups, Google, Wikipedia, Ask Jeeves, etc.
I have further results, which are almost unbelievable, of scores which go up with time.
Teacher: You can't catch me.
Two children watch a TEDTalk.
So how far can we go? One last little bit and I'll stop.
This one, they took only 10 minutes.
SM: So you know what's happened?
We could change everything.
And I found myself, after two years there and performing and learning, on the island of Bali, on the edge of a crater, Gunung Batur.
And they moved their bodies and they came forward, and the lights bounced off these costumes.
And they put on an opera all night long.
Three strokes, you get the whole bamboo forest.
And you see the mechanics.
And as it rises with the strings, I see that it's a sun.
But the fact is, without the dancer who knows how to use his body and swing on those wires, it's nothing.
Ariel: I boarded the king's ship. In every cabin, I flamed amazement.
Prospera: Caliban!
and our little life is rounded with a sleep.
The medium was apparent. It was banal. We saw it.
Peter Parker: Standing on the precipice, I can soar away from this. JT: We're trying to do everything in live theater that you can't do in two dimensions in film and television.
Bono: They're mythologies.
You hold on to the roots, you put your foot in the little rocks and climb up there, and you get to the top, and I was with a good friend who was an actor, and we said, "Let's go up there.
So I throw away my camera. I throw away my thongs, and I looked at the line straight in front of me, and I got down on all fours like a cat, and I held with my knees to either side of this line in front of me, for 30 yards or 30 feet, I don't know.
I have beautiful collaborators, and we as creators only get there all together.
So there's about 25,000 things there that can go wrong.
On the race car in front of you here there are about 120 sensors when it goes into a race.
So all of this is taking data and turning it into knowledge that we can act upon.
So the question is, why couldn't we see it?
And then, we applied an application on top which would allow us to tease out the patterns in the data in real time so we could see what was happening, so we could determine when things started to change.
The blue line is an indication of when patterns start to change, and immediately, before we even started putting in clinical interpretation, we can see that the data is speaking to us.
So we have a very ambitious program.
My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning.
And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language, and how what we call people so often distances us from them, and makes them little.
And with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery, so let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea."
And Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T," the women's hips were swaying and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.
And it taught me three lessons that I think are so important for us today, and certainly in the work that I do.
But, having had a father with heart disease, and realizing that what our family could afford was not what he should have gotten, and having a good friend step in to help, I really believe that all people deserve access to health at prices they can afford.
And so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.
And I think some of you may have visited -- these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe, who help them become more self-sufficient.
This is Samuel. He's a farmer.
It could alter the vector, but like Artemisia, it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility, Sumitomo said, "Why don't we experiment with whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?"
We thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.
Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.
So then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market, we have a choice.
But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace, and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education, her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams.
Thank you.
And we were very excited about this because, of course, they have a history of dancing with machines.
So we were excited by this idea, and we started talking about exactly what it would look like.
They wanted us to make use of the space.
Okay.
Of those 85 takes, only three actually successfully completed their run.
Little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust, and they fall out of the tracks, the exact angles makes it hard to get right.
I think our enemy was physics -- and she's a cruel mistress.
But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.
OK Go: An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC.
Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?
Well, in the mid-'70s, there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me, especially in Italy, and so I decided, with some researchers from the United States and the University of Florence, to start probing the murals decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500 searching for the lost Leonardo.
And in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center for cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture and archaeology. So students started to flow in, and we started to build technologies, because that's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and do fieldwork.
A lot has been said and written about the unicorn, but if you take an X-ray of the unicorn, it becomes a puppy dog.
Well, the tablet. Well, we thought, well, if we all have this pleasure, this privilege to see all this, to find all these discoveries, what about for everybody else?
This is not just a curiosity, because it changes not just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology, the meaning of the painting, and we believe this is a cool way, easy way, that everybody could have access to, to become more the protagonist of your own discovery, and not just be so passive about it, as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums.
They're all the perfect size, and they don't have an ounce of fat.
And the later it fails, the worse the consequences.
So they're skin cells that can be tricked, kind of like cellular amnesia, into an embryonic state.
Here's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard.
Don't you miss all that with these tissue-engineered models?
And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed, you can see, going forward, that tissue engineering is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening at every single step of the path: disease models making for better drug formulations, massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing, reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials, and individualized therapies that disrupt what we even consider to be a market at all.
I've tried to show in this -- though the color doesn't come out -- that what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past, a generation future -- your parents, your kids, things you can change over the next few decades -- and this 50-year time bubble you kind of move along in. And in that 50 years, if you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times since I was born. When you have a new baby, by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born.
Now, the third curve is information technology.
So, that's the stage out of all this. I find, for reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal.
Human-powered airplane -- Gossamer Condor sort of started me in this direction in 1976 and 77, winning the Kremer prize in aviation history, followed by the Albatross. And we began making various odd planes and creatures.
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.
Buckminster Fuller said it clearly: "there are no passengers on spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew, can and must do more with less -- much less."
Ray Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii.
Matt Keenan: It's switched on.
All right.
OK, here we go.
You can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales, you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s -- but when you get down to the nature's realm, nature has 200 million years of experience.
Sort of a timeline, very non-linear scale, nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs, and eventually we saw some humans with caves ... Birds were flying overhead, after pterosaurs.
The one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here is an utterly impractical flight vehicle, which is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that -- rubber-band powered -- that we'll show you.
And you wonder, is it practical? And it turns out if I had not been -- Unfortunately, we have some light bulb changes.
And I wanted to let you know, a lot of the things you've heard about Australians are true.
I cast my mind back when I was in second grade at a beautiful little government-run school called Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney, and as we came up towards lunchtime, our teacher, Ms. Russell, said to the class, "Hey, year two. What do you want to do after lunch?
And there was that same awkward silence from most of my classmates, until sitting next to me, one of my friends, one of the cool kids in class, Steven, leaned across and punched me really hard in the head.
Numbers are the musical notes with which the symphony of the universe is written.
The proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties.
So 2 ^ 5 is 2 x 2 = 4, 8, 16, 32.
- 1 = 2,047, and you don't need me to tell you that's 23 x 89.
He proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill, ink, paper and his mind.
But he didn't know what the factors were.
It got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format -- and for the rest of the hour of his talk Frank Nelson Cole busted that out.
It was the year I left university.
And during that time, since I've left university, these numbers have got bigger and bigger, each one dwarfing the last, until along came this man, Dr. Curtis Cooper, who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime, only to see it snatched away by a rival university.
We're not talking sport today.
This is all seven Harry Potter novels, because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end.
I know what you're thinking: Adam, we're happy that you're happy, but why should we care?
But for me it's amazing because it's a metaphor for the time in which we live, when human minds and machines can conquer together.
That scares some people. That excites me.
It might have been a book I read, the arts. No, no, no.
It's beyond our reach."
The Tasmanian devil has shown us that, not only can cancer be a contagious disease, but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction.
In fact, growing up in Tasmania, it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a Tasmanian devil in the wild.
Now there's only a small part of the population, which remains unaffected.
Her body was riddled with secondary tumors.
In fact, the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister, and something that we hadn't really thought of before.
That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat.
The next slide is going to be gruesome.
What this told us was that Jonas' tumor did not arise from cells of his own body.
They tend to bite each other, often quite ferociously and usually on the face.
He's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya.
We also believe this cancer might be very old.
And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in 1957 injecting cancer into a volunteer, who in this case was an inmate in Ohio State Penitentiary.
In fact, I believe, given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth, we can defeat cancer.
In short, we're more optimistic than realistic, but we are oblivious to the fact.
And we all think our kids will be especially talented.
And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay, but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so.
Okay, now do the same for your driving ability.
And it's a global phenomenon.
Number one: Whatever happens, whether you succeed or you fail, people with high expectations always feel better.
Next time reality would catch up with them.
So why is that?
People prefer Friday because Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead, all the plans that you have.
So optimism changes subjective reality.
So all in all, optimism has lots of benefits.
And then we asked them again, "How likely are you to suffer from cancer?"
And it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them; everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer is about 30 percent and the average likelihood of divorce is about 40 percent.
One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus.
Could we alter people's optimism bias by interfering with the brain activity in these regions?
Now we interfere with the region that we found to integrate negative information in this task, and the optimism bias grew even larger.
He says, "Fatality investigations for firefighters often include 'We didn't think the fire was going to do that,' even when all of the available information was there to make safe decisions."
The key here really is knowledge.
But if you are an extreme optimistic penguin who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best, you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground.
And I want to tell you about them each separately and then how they interact and why, in the end, there may be some good news.
To understand power diffusion put this in your mind: computing and communications costs have fallen a thousandfold between 1970 and the beginning of this century.
If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe -- the last time I looked, it was something like a pound an hour -- and if you have Skype, it's free.
We think in terms of war and interstate war.
And that ability to get others to want what you want, to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment, is what I call soft power.
Now let me go back to the question of power transition between states and what's happening there.
In 1973, with the oil embargo and the closing of the gold window, that was the end of America.
Now someday, with a billion point three people getting richer, they are going to be bigger than the United States.
And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans until somewhere in the latter part, after 2050, of this century.
So these simple projections of the Goldman Sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition.
Thucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War, said it was the rise in the power of Athens and the fear it created in Sparta.
And the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the East is fear.
Middle board of this three-dimensional chess game: economic power among states.
If China develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions, that's good for us as well as good for China as well as good for everybody else.
Hard power is there, and it will remain.
So if one looks at the statements that have been made about this, I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton described the foreign policy of the Obama administration, she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration was going to be smart power, as she put it, "using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box."
Why has the record been so poor?
It's an election.
Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government?
If the reality is stagnation, I can only go up if you go down.
The first actor is the Security Council.
The donors provide post-conflict aid.
One is it's got to do economic reform, not fuss about the political constitution.
So those three actors.
So that's idea one: recognize interdependence.
So jobs, health, and clean government.
And why are they upset? Because they have nothing to do.
There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade, and which can generate a lot of jobs, and which is, in any case, a sensible sector to expand, post-conflict, and that is the construction sector.
Just think what you have to do successfully to build a structure, using a lot of labor.
And to date, there has been a sort of a schizophrenia in the donor community, as to how to build basic services in post-conflict sectors.
So the NGOs become part of a public government system, rather than independent of it.
They would be co-branded as being done by the post-conflict government, in the country.
So building clean government means, yes, provide money to the budget, but also provide a lot of scrutiny, which means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money.
And so gradually the selection, the composition of politicians, would shift from the crooked to the honest.
Fortunately, they and other family members got out in time, but they lost their homes, and as you can see, just about everything in them.
And how will they cope in a foreign land?
So what can we do? How can we prepare and adapt?
And around the world, satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood-prone areas such as Bangladesh.
In Ethiopia, 70 percent, that's 7-0 percent of the population, depends on rainfall for its livelihood.
They're splitting the cost of installing these green roofs with home and building owners.
Here's just one example, San Francisco Airport, with 16 inches or more of flooding.
These are not only important ecosystems in their own right, but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities.
But we can simply no longer rely on established norms.
Let's talk about manias.
Listen as Chinese students practice their English by screaming it.
S: I don't want to let myself down.
Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days.
S: I want to speak perfect English.
The world has other universal languages.
As you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900 have altered because the roads are better and because of technology.
Now this has raised all sorts of questions.
And then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye.
They wanted to break it up into little bits that they could use.
A fish can't do anything to a crow."
And the fellow said, "Well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there."
If a wise person came from the North Pole and told me the bears were white, I might believe him, but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear."
That is, we've gone from four to eight years of education to 12 years of formal education, and 52 percent of Americans have actually experienced some type of tertiary education.
And you were supposed to think, well, the state legislature was rural-controlled, and they hated the big city, so rather than putting the capital in a big city, they put it in a county seat.
Today, 35 percent of Americans practice cognitively demanding professions, not only to the professions proper like lawyer or doctor or scientist or lecturer, but many, many sub-professions having to do with being a technician, a computer programmer.
They had to look at computer projections for the housing market.
Some of the habits of mind that we have developed over the 20th century have paid off in unexpected areas.
they said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said.
They're just inherited mores.
It must be that blacks are somehow tainted.
Some of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices, and it's all about analogies.
By 2010, college graduates, if you said two circles followed by a semicircle, two sixteens followed by what, they would say eight, because eight is half of 16.
Think how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fifth time Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order, and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four previous occasions.
I'm very fortunate to be here.
And she's a very high-tech superintendent.
And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office, and it reminds me of him.
I said, "What is that, dad?" "A job."
There weren't really many materials or things to use.
His name is Chris Farina.
It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers.
And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day.
That's my brother Malcolm there on the right.
There are many people on this stage right now.
And so we made the game, and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure.
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them.
There's oil spills, environmental disasters, water rights disputes, breakaway republics, famine, endangered species and global warming.
Stewart Brand is here, and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force.
See, Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot, and he's trying to tell us how to fix that problem.
JH: All right, we're going into negotiations as of now. Go.
And she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor.
And we learned in this, you don't really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks.
That's the kind of thinking that we put them in, the situations.
There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room.
We all lose.
And I think it's sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said.
We had played the game one session after school for many weeks, about seven weeks, and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises.
I thought, I'm failing as a teacher.
I didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom.
And there are three seconds left on the clock.
And they find out what is right their own way, their own selves.
America was jolted by the anti-Vietnam movement, the Civil Rights movement.
Many people were inspired by this.
So I took one year off, and I went to this village science program.
It's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles -- an acute angle, a right angle, an obtuse angle, a straight angle.
Look at the pentagon, for instance, pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium.
We can't make a bridge with squares because the train would come, it would start doing a jig.
And once you make these, you make a little house.
And I thought this was so much better than making trucks.
It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon.
And this is the pump.
This is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing.
And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination.
Six major research papers on this.
This is a kind of a blowing straw.
This is a permanent magnet.
In a democratic country, science must reach to our most oppressed, to the most marginalized children.
This is a little straw, and what you do is you just nip two corners here, and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth.
Well before I go any further, this is something worth sharing.
And this has come as a great boon to them.
And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED.
And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this.
And you can see, this is a little fantail bird.
That night, when the passengers would be sleeping, he would give it one more fold, and the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap -- with a little shoot just like a designer cap, because it protects the spinal cord.
They were singing and dancing.
I'd like to start with a couple of quick examples.
And what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels.
And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it.
And in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes.
And with less overall weight in the superstructure, there were big savings in the foundations.
In ecosystems, the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system.
When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.
Then we would have an anaerobic digester, which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area, turn that into heat for the greenhouse and electricity to feed back into the grid.
It may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago.
So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea, you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell.
We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse.
And when you think about nature, often you think about it as being all about competition.
That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces.
You think, "What can I add to the system to create more value?"
And then after that, there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract, like phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them.
They're not just possible; they're critical.
Thank you.
I am constantly swimming in numbers and formulas and charts.
Population of Philadelphia: It has 1.5 million people.
One, I can take my grandmother's advice and sort of least-expect my way into maybe bumping into the one out of 35 possible men in the entire 1.5 million-person city of Philadelphia, or I could try online dating.
So I decided to sign on.
So obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward.
So we're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner, and I've decided Steve the I.T. guy and I are really just not meant for each other, but we'll part ways as friends, when he gets up to go to the bathroom, and in the meantime the bill comes to our table.
So I said, fine, from here on out I'm only going on dates where I know that there's wi-fi, and I'm bringing my laptop.
See, the real problem here is that, while the algorithms work just fine, you and I don't, when confronted with blank windows where we're supposed to input our information online.
So knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people, I decided instead to ask my own questions.
So I now have these 72 different data points, which, to be fair, is a lot.
I found Jewishdoc57 who's incredibly good-looking, incredibly well-spoken, he had hiked Mt. Fuji, he had walked along the Great Wall.
She said she was a "fun girl who is Happy and Outgoing."
But I didn't want everybody's data.
Well, one month later, I had a lot of data, and I was able to do another analysis.
Remember, I'm somebody who said that I speak fluent Japanese and I know JavaScript and I was okay with that.
Once I had all of this information, I was able to create a super profile, so it was still me, but it was me optimized now for this ecosystem.
They said, "What? You're still being too damn picky."
Obviously, I'm having a fabulous life, so -- -- the question is, what does all of this mean for you?
And I'll take her advice on that.
Would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra?
It's not, and binging is never good.
We actually know how to test that statement.
The other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray.
["Chair"] Orange, good. ["Table"] Green.
What we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games, they actually resolve the conflict faster.
Was it yellow initially or blue?
A bit more challenging, right?
We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have. That would be a little costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy, how good they are at switching from one task to another.
The first one is that not all media are created equal.
That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain.
And one more step is to do training studies.
It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games.
There is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can't resist.
Now, of course, that idea has brought us all of the computer technology we have today and so on.
But I wanted to look not at the astronomical universe, but at the computational universe.
You get something a little bit more complicated.
So let's take a closer look at rule number 30 here.
It also brings up new issues, though, like computational irreducibility.
People like Leibniz had wondered about that too 300 years earlier.
Hope for the best.
let's say the revenue of Microsoft.
It's got, by now, pretty good coverage of everything you might find in a standard reference library.
Well, a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language, which means that we've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them.
I mean, everything is scaling up very nicely and we're getting more confident.
Here we'll just create, in this line, a little user interface that allows us to do something fun there.
You can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have Wolfram Alpha figure out what you're talking about.
This is probably a fairly small piece of Mathematica code that's able to be run here.
And, for example, Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica are actually now full of algorithms that we discovered by searching the computational universe.
If the rules for the universe are simple, it's kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level; operating, for example, far below the level of space or time, which makes it hard to represent things.
A few years ago, I was pretty excited to discover that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce special relativity, and even general relativity and gravitation, and at least give hints of quantum mechanics.
and be able to type into Wolfram Alpha, "the theory of the universe," and have it tell us.
Are you able to say in a sentence or two how this type of thinking could integrate at some point to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explanations of the universe?
Benoit has been particularly interested in nested patterns, in fractals and so on, where the structure is something that's kind of tree-like, and where there's sort of a big branch that makes little branches and even smaller branches and so on.
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.
I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda.
So, right now, we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips.
I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality.
And you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them.
I went to school not because the Maasais' women or girls were going to school.
But when my father came, he would sell the cows, he would sell the products we had, and he went and drank with his friends in the bars.
So I wanted to become a teacher.
I told my father, "I will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school."
We walked out to the courtyard, and there were a bunch of people waiting.
After bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.
I met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the University of Oregon.
This gentleman, he helped me.
So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition.
He said, "Well, but I can't do it alone."
I learned that that ceremony that I went through when I was 13 years old, it was called female genital mutilation.
They were getting mutilated, and here, after I graduated from here, I worked at the U.N., I went back to school to get my graduate work, the constant cry of these girls was in my face.
As we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers, the fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said: "We want a school for boys."
She's an orphan. Yes, we could have taken her for that.
She was not the top student when we took her.
As we speak right now, women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we've started in our community.
Be the first. People will follow you.
We've looked at our government oversight.
So, if you've been gone, this is the easy CliffsNotes on what's happened in the economy. Okay?
It took us 50 years to reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent. 50 years.
And of course our banks did as well, as did our federal government.
They are taking responsibility.
Because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation.
Vasectomies are up 48 percent, according to the Cornell institute.
Based on Y&amp;R's BrandAsset Valuator, proprietary tool of VML and Young &amp; Rubicam, we set out to understand what's been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace.
First things is we see something must be happening when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.
And then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents.
Another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of Zynga.
And, as a result, businesses must provide not only value, but values.
So, from a value and values standpoint, what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways.
We're seeing on our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon, not a sprint.
We also see a big DIY movement.
Patagonia's Footprint Chronicles basically goes through and tracks every product that they make, and gives you social responsibility, and helps you understand the ethics that are behind the product that they make.
It's now about connecting to your communities, connecting to your social networks.
So, this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon.
And then we look at what companies can do.
So that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic.
You see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt, all because the consumer is demanding it.
It will make longer-lasting products. It will create better, more intuitive customer service.
So, I decided to investigate.
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."
I'm telling you where I need your help.
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.
I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.
But before I go there, please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story.
On the other hand was my grandmother, who also took care of me and was more spiritual, less educated and definitely less rational.
From her, I learned, amongst many other things, one very precious lesson -- that if you want to destroy something in this life, be it an acne, a blemish or the human soul, all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls.
It's an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection.
In retrospect, I think she was slightly worried about my sanity.
My mother became a diplomat.
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there.
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning, I saw something that stopped me in my tracks.
I started writing fiction in English.
And this is what I discovered in Boston -- that frustration was very stimulating.
When my first novel written in English came out in America, I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.
Many authors feel this pressure, but non-Western authors feel it more heavily.
There's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together.
It comes from everywhere.
Writers are entitled to their political opinions, and there are good political novels out there, but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics.
Fiction is flowing water.
If it cannot take us there, it is not good literature.
Like that, my fiction as well.
But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most.
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all.
Bob Dylan is 23 years old, and his career is just reaching its pinnacle.
I think these are the basic elements of all creativity.
Alongside that is "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right."
We know this tune, right? We know it?
I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work.
This is at TED, actually, about a year earlier.
Here is the first ever slide-to-unlock.
For example ...
We have no such aversion towards copying what other people have, because we do that nonstop.
I think this is mostly what we do.
And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.
And they say, "Well, streets don't have names.
The first house ever built on a block is house number one.
And this map is also accurate.
And it's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs.
from medical research, space exploration, where I work, at CERN in Geneva, particle physics, engineering, even arts and humanities, funded from the science budget, which is that 3.3 billion, that little, tiny yellow blob around the orange blob at the top left of the screen.
So that big sweeping, white sphere in the corner is Saturn, which is actually in the background of the picture.
What we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon.
And so this, again, a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space, absolutely beautiful.
We think it's saltwater, and that would mean that there's more water on that moon of Jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined.
Earthrise from Apollo 8.
So the Apollo program paid for itself in inspiration, in engineering, achievement and, I think, in inspiring young scientists and engineers 14 times over.
Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that's explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them.
And the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element.
And one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics, just by looking at the structure of atoms -- the same theory that describes transistors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than, quite specifically, 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.
This is about 50 million light years away, so one of our neighboring galaxies.
And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star, until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit, and then it explodes.
And they certainly didn't intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions, which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe.
And if I blow it up there, you see it.
It's currently 10 billion miles away from Earth, transmitting with that dish, with the power of 20 watts, and we're still in contact with it.
On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you've ever heard of, every human being who ever was lived out their lives.
And it's made today in these difficult economic times.
I don't know why, but I'm continually amazed to think that two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the Internet and that at any point in time more than 30 percent of the world's population can go online to learn, to create and to share.
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing.
So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further.
Now like most of you, I actually start my day going online and checking email.
So let me fast-forward through the rest of my day.
The revenue of the top handful of companies in this space is over 39 billion dollars today.
We'd take action. It may not be good action, but we would take action.
Because the memory of the Internet is forever.
My mother, out in the audience, she jumped up, "Hallelujah, Johnny's talking!"
Even though this one is kind of unusual, I want you to think about your own journey.
You're walking to make us feel bad."
And so I told my mother, "I'm happy though, I'm really happy."
And in my mind, I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back, while they were still finishing up.
Well, that lasted 17 years.
We have a special program for you." They did.
And I was there. I showed up in two years and they -- I tell this story because they really helped me.
He came back; he said to me, "OK John, now that you've registered for that one credit, you can have a key to an office, you can matriculate -- you're matriculating, so you can use the library.
All the students sat around and they went ...
"Yes, you can clear cut ..."
I hunched my shoulder, I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin.
I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast, put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean -- it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States.
Well, my journey kept going on.
How could that be, how could that be?
And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other.
I don't need to show you my passport. It's in the back of my pack.
I was a prisoner and I needed to escape.
I was going to have to change.
We have to change now.
Although my family constantly struggled against poverty, I was always loved and cared for first, because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family.
Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time, and in 2003, when I was 13 years old, my father became one of them.
My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash.
That hope kept me alive.
I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea, or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China.
But it was harder than living in North Korea, because I was not free.
My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying, but it didn't work.
And during dinner, I wanted to have one more wing, but I realized there were not enough for everyone, so I decided against it.
And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice.
My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction, and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America.
My foster father didn't intend to change my life.
JK: Okay, I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don't think I can make it without tearing up.
JK: I haven't spent much time with you, but I know that you still love me, and you probably still pray for me and think about me.
This is the first temporary building made out of paper.
My goal was when the building was demolished, because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste, so my building has to be reused or recycled.
That was the problem.
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters.
Over two million people became refugees.
And then, year afterward, 1995, in Kobe, Japan, we had a big earthquake.
So I proposed to rebuild. I raised -- did fundraising.
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.
2001, in West India, I built also a shelter.
And they are very kind, affording my model.
But look at this. There's no privacy.
He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [fields].
Thank you very much.
Maybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement, which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones.
Fetal origins is a scientific discipline that emerged just about two decades ago, and it's based on the theory that our health and well-being throughout our lives is crucially affected by the nine months we spend in the womb.
But the pregnant woman's own voice reverberates through her body, reaching the fetus much more readily.
My favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that show once they were born.
It's also tastes and smells.
What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat.
The fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body, makes them part of its flesh and blood.
To conclude, I want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world even before they're born.
But there was another population that was affected -- the 40,000 fetuses in utero during the siege.
This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term, but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs, deprived early on, become more susceptible to disease.
The real trouble comes when pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators, when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty.
About a year after 9/11, researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.
Let me be clear.
And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.
It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind.
Without this ability there is no magic.
Magicians play with fire and steel, defy the fury of the buzzsaw, dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape.
MT: In that respect, magic tricks are like jokes.
They want to share the experience.
The tools of social networking, these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story.
Tommy Mizzone: Tonight we're going to play you two songs.
JM: Thank you all.
Because it does seem to me that large organizations including government, which is, of course, the largest organization of all, have actually become completely disconnected with what actually matters to people.
Quite nice in itself, they're little, sort of, airplane things.
It actually says garage, funk, rhythm and blues.
It's a tiny, tiny thing.
It's those people I'd quite like to create in the world going forward.
So I did come up with five suggestions, which they are actually actioning.
What can we do and encourage more online banking?"
And you're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large.
It wants the world to be the kind of place where the input and the change are proportionate.
And I'd be wrong to dis that completely.
And the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff.
Thank you very much.
The power and coherency that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices makes a very different experience.
And this is essential to the progress of science, or exploration of what is possible.
So here, I have my computer set up with the projector, and I have a Wii remote sitting on top of it.
Thank you.
And why this is interesting is that if you put on, say, a pair of safety glasses, that have two infrared dots in them, what these two dots are essentially going to give you is, give the computer an approximation of your head location.
Thank you.
I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor.
That was news to me, and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.
In the years following, the other stories I heard about the poor growing up were no more positive.
I stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as I had before.
I was purchasing something -- I was buying my right to go on with my day and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.
But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well -- think of that as financial services for the poor.
All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital.
Their business trajectory would change.
Because the best way for people to change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.
I just got this impression that the money would work.
In October of '05, after those first seven loans were paid, Matt and I took the word beta off of the site.
And while those numbers and those statistics are really fun to talk about and they're interesting, to me, Kiva's really about stories.
Imagine if you're speaking with somebody who's growing things and making them flourish, somebody who's using their talents to do something productive, somebody who's built their own business from scratch, someone who is surrounded by abundance, not scarcity, who's in fact creating abundance, somebody with full hands with something to offer, not empty hands asking for you to give them something.
You see an opportunity and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.
That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.
Another thing is, it turns out, those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect -- banks, venture capitalists, other organizations and support structures -- they come from friends and family.
We make it really, really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site.
What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it, just like they've cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Distant galaxies were moving away from us.
And second, there was no question of the initial state of the universe.
We think we have solved the mystery of creation.
This suggests that a probability of life appearing is reasonably high.
This brings me to the last of the big questions: the future of the human race.
That is why I am in favor of manned -- or should I say, personed -- space flight.
The alternative is that civilizations don't last very long, but destroy themselves.
A couple of examples.
How beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island.
That's almost my name. SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
So here are pictures of myself.
But Drake's idea here became very popular because it was very appealing — and I'll get back to that — and on the basis of this experiment, which didn't succeed, we have been doing SETI ever since, not continuously, but ever since.
That's a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card, okay?
In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.
They're like, you know, kittens. You get a litter.
All right, so the bottom line is this: Because of the increase in speed, and because of the vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos, I figure we're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years.
And I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right?
We don't know what that's going to do to you, not in the long term, and not even very much in the short term.
It would change his day, all right?
So those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection.
Now, look, a lot has been written about the deplorable state of science literacy in this country.
Now, we've got to solve that problem, because that's a critically important problem, and you might say, "Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?"
Ask the next 10 people you see on the streets, "Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?"
It's exciting because we're naturally interested in other intelligent beings, and I think that's part of our hardwiring.
So to me this is interesting and important, and in fact, it's my policy, even though I give a lot of talks to adults, you give talks to adults, and two days later they're back where they were.
And so I got interested in electronics, and you know, I studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff.
Now, that kid was wrong by four orders of magnitude, but there was no doubt about it, these kids were smart.
What I see is the generation behind me.
There's a flying turkey under a tree.
And in a place where we thought no life at all, we find more life, we think, and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest, which tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all.
And these two males are fighting, they do it by bouncing their butts together, which is an interesting concept. Now, here's a male on the left and a female on the right, and the male has managed to split his coloration so the female only always sees the kinder gentler squid in him.
Disappears right into the background.
There's a good reason why: the shallow water's full of predators -- here's a barracuda -- and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod, you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide.
Watch the skin color; watch the skin texture.
All right.
We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet.
I think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry.
With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way.
Of course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today.
You either don't know what you're looking for, or you're looking in the wrong place," he said.
How would you feel if you were me? You have something extraordinary in your hand, but you are in the middle of nowhere?
Once that was done, then it was possible to compare.
How?
What do we actually know about our ancestors?
That's why we need care from our parents.
It's, in a way, your voice box.
Up to now, the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils, the baby fossils, were missing.
And they were probably not aware of this future legacy, but they did great.
And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa.
It is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.
And then finally, we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation, but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect.
So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all.
But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations, trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed.
The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there.
Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now: the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.
There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long.
This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area.
We need to work locally, but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.
And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN, to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers.
Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.
And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.
Thank you.
So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed, and pass it on to kids?
Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!
Goldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts.
Ideas! TED-ster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea: founding the first micro-computer software company."
Thank you TED-sters for all your interviews!
Now, while as a journalist, Miller's archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most, the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that's something completely different than anything that's been created by any previous generation.
Now we're already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die.
So what that service does, quite simply, is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die.
Well right now, as you can see, the results can be somewhat comical.

And people do terrible things in wars.
He'd already smuggled vitamin C into the camp, and now he managed to get hold of supplies of marmite on the black market.
He gives half of them vitamin B12.
But a young German doctor picks up Archie Cochrane's exercise book and says to his colleagues, "This evidence is incontrovertible.
So the symptoms of the complex are, no matter how complicated the problem, you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution.
You know Hans: the Mick Jagger of TED.
He's at MIT.
Five thousand products -- that's still nothing.
This is how complex the economy we've created is.
And we don't.
This baby was produced through trial and error.
Let's say you're Unilever and you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool.
You make lots of money.
You take a nozzle and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle.
And the moment you step back from the God complex -- let's just try to have a bunch of stuff; let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not -- you can solve your problem.
Which leads us to conclude American businesses fail faster than Americans, and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans.
Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing?"
I want to fix our education system.
It's so uncomfortable.
He ran his trial.
Shut it down at once."
I do not want to have my opinions challenged.
So shortly after the war, this young man, Yutaka Taniyama, developed this amazing conjecture called the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture.
He made a lot of mistakes.
There are many science-based analyses of this, but they all draw the same conclusion -- that we're living beyond our means.
In other words, thanks to those pesky laws of physics, when things aren't sustainable, they stop.
And I'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes.
We are certainly amazing, and we regularly solve complex problems with amazing creativity.
I find this argument fascinating, as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs.
See what happens when you operate a system past its limits and then keep on going at an ever-accelerating rate is that the system stops working and breaks down.
We're not even slowing down.
So when does this transition begin?
I want to talk to you about fear.
Imagine the Middle East without oil income, but with collapsing governments.
Perhaps denial.
That's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on, because if we wait until the crisis takes hold, we may panic and hide.
Think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult suddenly become relatively easy.
To my surprise, eliminating net CO2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap, not very cheap, but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization.
But fear can be paralyzing or motivating.
We've built a powerful foundation of science, knowledge and technology -- more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent, meaningful and satisfying lives.

Those three trends are the ability to engineer cells, the ability to engineer tissues, and robots.
It turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.
But the problem with Santa Clause is, if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing and promising folks, it turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending on what we call "entitlements."
This guy runs the China Investment Corporation.
I think I can safely say that I'm the only trillionaire in this room.
If you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.
If you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.
This is going to happen when hell freezes over.
That's the financial crisis.
And that's where these three trends come together.
They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.
And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn't, and where it was in the phase.
Four years ago, I showed you this picture.
But now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate, because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes.
So, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea, they took all the cells off the trachea, they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.
Then, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.
And all we've got is a Roomba.
This is not an intelligence Turing rest, but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.
He sued to be allowed to run, and he won the suit, but didn't qualify by time.
They'll be able to focus their hearing, they'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity, do a series of things that we can't do.
And, of course, the future is looking back 200 years, because next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth.
The universe was created 13.7 billion years ago, and then you created all the stars, and all the planets, and all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.
And I think this isn't 1,000 years out.
And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died, but it was certainly better than what they had before.
And this went on for quite some time. People were happy.
And the people were happy. They were satisfied.
We would lose all of our market."
It doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats.
And this is all relative to unrestrained -- the bigger the bar, the better. Okay.
And it's not just overall. It's very robust to anything you want to look at.
They say, "Well, that's impossible, that can't be."
And it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country, none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said, some explicitly, some not so explicitly, "All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers.
And I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think car seats are so great. Look at the kid in the car seat.
This is a car seat that was installed by someone who has installed 1,000 car seats, who knew exactly how to do it.
But still, if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government, and said, "I have invented a new car seat.
Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all.
And then, let's make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain."
So, my father would have patients come in who he thought were not really sick.
And he would say, listen, I know I gave you that huge pill, that complicated, hard-to-swallow pill before, but now I've got one that's so potent, that is really tiny and small and almost invisible.
So in this data, it's statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lap-and-shoulder belts.
So all of the things that we've seen come about, starting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth, which we couldn't even imagine happening before, all these things rolling into our lives, just this abundance of things that are right before us, sitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop.
The other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago, as I looked at what even Wired was talking about, we thought it was going to be TV, but better.
So, I have a kind of a simple story, and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making, this thing that has happened in 5,000 days -- that's all these computers, all these handhelds, all these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers -- basically what we're getting out of all these connections is we're getting one machine.
What are the dimensions of this machine?
So here's the specifications, just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it: 170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links, emails running at two megahertz itself, 31 kilohertz text messaging, 246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk.
But to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size -- and its complexity, kind of -- to your brain.
And the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture.
It's wireless. It's always connected.
They're going through the machine.
So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels, and a car as a chip with wheels, because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials.
And the network effects rule, meaning that the more you have, the more you get.
So we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches, through all our digital photographs and cameras.
And what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this, you had to share packets of information.
So that's what we were doing.
So something will resolve down to the information about a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID.
There's like a billion social sites on the Web.
So you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step than just sharing your Web page, or your computer.
And I found out by looking at it that I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning.
We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing.
And I think it's going to be smarter.
It looks more global. If you take this whole thing, it is a very big machine, very reliable machine, more reliable than its parts.
To share is to gain. Let the One read it.
And within a week I had come to believe that the second coming of Christ had occurred, that it was Sun Myung Moon, and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God to be his disciple.
Most of the cases I went out on were called involuntary.
Because something did.
Their mates were chosen for them.
In 1974, I was young, I was naive, and I was pretty lost in my world.
It becomes impenetrable.
It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us.
And instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space, I work in the mineral world. I work with more or less inert matter.
I'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things.
I have no interest in that whatsoever.
And I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city, an accretional notion of the city, and that led to various ideas of organization.
This is a project that we just finished in Penang for a very, very large city project that came directly out of this process, which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it.
In this case, we only used 15 of the 60 acres of land, and the 45 acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village.
This is Jim Dine, and it's the absence of presence, etc.
And now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated.
It's transparent, and it allows you to understand, I think, what is always the most interesting thing in any building, which is the actual constructional processes that make it.
And again, we're looking at an early sketch where I'm understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower.
It adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning.
And I understood that building really could be the augmentation of the Earth's surface, and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense.
And, of course, we're interested in participating with education.
And this is how they see the world.
The new capital competition for Berlin, four years ago.
The main idea was the gateway, where it breaks the site, and the building occupies both the public space and the private space.
And I'm a character that's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone.
Here's a piano nobile, which is a device used in the Renaissance.
So everyone of you turns to their neighbor please.
It is made for a diet which is soft, mushy, which is reduced in fibers, which is very easily chewable and digestible.
So cooking is a very important technology.
It's very expensive.
Now, cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species.
Okay, it's not obvious to be honest.
What kind of criteria did it use?
Think about bittersweet chocolate; or think about the acidity of yogurt -- wonderful -- mixed with strawberry fruits.
If you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated, was not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong.
I took the three elements -- stomach, small intestine and colon.
So if we give you a specification, this brain, which is autonomous, have 500 million nerve cells, 100 million neurons -- so around the size of a cat brain, so there sleeps a little cat -- thinks for itself, optimizes whatever it digests.
And then finally, it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery, which actually digests the food we cook.
If you have an empty stomach, your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin.
We have transferred enough energy."
This is fat digestion.
Now if we could take this language -- and this is a language of structures -- and make it longer-lasting, that it can go through the passage of the intestine, it would generate stronger signals.

And he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt, through ritual, to rekindle a connection that had been irrevocably lost.
We all have to deal with the mystery of death, the world that waits beyond death, the elders who fall away into their elderly years.
All peoples are simply cultural options, different visions of life itself.
And if we slip from the realm of the sea into the realm of the spirit of the imagination, you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism.
Their billboards are manuals, prayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures.
And the fourth and most important, of course, was the delineation of a contemplative practice that not only had the possibility of a transformation of the human heart, but had 2,500 years of empirical evidence that such a transformation was a certainty.
Once each year, the fastest young boy in each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman.
I only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day than anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant.
But more importantly, it was linked in to the Andean notions of sacred geography.
Right on the slopes of the Koariti.
And I always wanted to go back into these mountains, to see if this could possibly be true, as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist, Reichel-Dolmatoff.
You can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd.
When I first met Danilo, in the Colombian embassy in Washington, I couldn't help but say, "You know, you look a lot like an old friend of mine."
For that entire time, the world only exists as an abstraction, as he is taught the values of society, including this notion that their prayers alone maintain the cosmic balance.
It's going to look like a John Ford Western.
Now, if we slip to another end of the world, I was up in the high Arctic to tell a story about global warming, inspired in part by the former Vice President's wonderful book.
The world remains a rich tapestry.
The myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us.
Thank you very much.
Yet, after just a few weeks of use, you'll throw this material in the trash.
They're basically fouling up Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems.
We should be talking about half, a quarter, one-tenth the energy content.
And this gets us back to the mushrooms.
So I'd like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials.
We then process these husks with some basic equipment.
Our entire facility is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools sitting indoors in the dark, quietly self-assembling materials -- and everything from building materials to, in this case, a packaging corner block.
But it's much faster than conventional farming.
You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls, because you have multiple choices.
And I think that can be some really good news.
The reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons, and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light.
Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough, something truly bizarre happens.
And this is the great pleasure of science: the defeat of our intuition through experimentation.
Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds.
For example, at the University of Minnesota, there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde, and he works with dancers to study how cells move.
I think that bad PowerPoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy.
Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money.
Once we eliminate public funding for the artists, let's put them back to work by using them instead of PowerPoint.
As other speakers have said, it's a rather daunting experience -- a particularly daunting experience -- to be speaking in front of this audience.
This evening, there's a reception in the University's Museum of Natural History.
And you'll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to.
Don't tell her I said that.
So you've had a pretty easy time up till now -- a few laughs, and all that kind of thing -- in the talks to date.
So you might think there are more interesting things to do, but humor me for the moment.
And you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-head appears and you average them. OK?
Who thinks that A is true -- that, on average, it'll take longer to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail?
How could that be?
On this side -- remember, you're excited about head-tail-tail; you're excited about head-tail-head.
On this side, there's a different experience.
It's another way of getting the intuition.
And instead of asking the question, "How long until I see a head-tail-head?" -- you can ask, "How big will the chunks be when I use a restriction enzyme which cuts whenever it sees G-A-A-G, for example?
The natural thing to do after you've done that -- and that's what this project, the International HapMap Project, which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries.
Because we understand very little about most human diseases.
What's the chance that they do?
It actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is.
Amongst all these other people who don't have the disease, the test will get it right 99 percent of the time.
The other explanation is that the person does have the disease -- that's unlikely -- but the test gets it right, which is likely.
Later, and fairly recently, acquitted on appeal -- in fact, on the second appeal.
So if you toss a coin twice, the chance of getting a head twice are a half -- that's the chance the first time -- times a half -- the chance a second time.
They've probably got these environmental risk factors and/or genetic risk factors we don't know about.
In the disease example, we had to bear in mind two things, one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not.
Now, we probably think a priori that's unlikely.
There's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences.
We can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly -- and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here.
Please drive your car home over it," they would have said, "Well, pediatricians don't know how to build bridges.
And there have been celebrated appeal cases in Britain and elsewhere because of that.
The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives, worldwide.
So what about circuit breakers?
Now, every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network.
Hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms from a central location, or even a cell phone.
Thank you.
This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy.
Same was true for China.
But we also use a very simple metaphor, the cat and the mouse game, to describe in the past 15 years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship, government censorship, the cat, and the Chinese Internet users. That means us, the mouse.
You have Facebook, we have Renren.
Sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands.
So he can't prevent it, his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption.
So it angered the Chinese Netizens.
But 99 percent of Chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the Embassy's side.
It's the same content. One, you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets.
It became the media platform of 300 million readers.
And even some of them were put into black jails.
But also, it is like the first time a public sphere happened in China.
So that's kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè, that's very good.
So they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident.
It's never happened before.
Something you find is, freedom is weird.
So that's the update about this game, cat-and-mouse.
SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, TPP and ITU.
We don't really think of the evolutionary need to be protected by our senses, but that's probably why our senses really evolved -- to keep us safe, to allow us to live.
So many of you know that that's Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.
And it's at the hair cell level that they do this.
Mother: That's an owl.
Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years.
Now actually, this is quite crude in comparison to our regular inner ear.
Do you remember writing that chapter?
Girl: I just take off my CI, and I don't hear anything.
And so when it comes to this idea of restoring beauty to somebody's life, we have a long way to go when it comes to audition.
There's really very little point in listening to music when it doesn't sound good to you.
Now this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff's Prelude.
But it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended.
Cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments.
I'm going to play you two clips of Usher, one which is normal and one which has almost no high frequencies, almost no low frequencies and not even that many mid frequencies.
This is Beethoven.
Text: Beethoven doesn't excite her.
And here's a video of Joseph.
Since then, I've never looked back.
And it's one of the most awful things -- heartwarming, but awful.
And I don't mean to understate how important it is to restore basic function.
Some chose the microscope as their instrument.
I chose this instrument.
The Netherlands is not at war.
Why then am I standing before you with this weapon?
The Nazis invaded The Netherlands.
At this decisive moment in Dutch history my father was positioned on the bank of the river Waal near the city of Nijmegen.
But with an old gun, not even the best marksman in the armed forces could have hit the mark.
I stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability.
Why?
It removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies.
War is simply no longer the best option, and that is why violence has decreased.
Failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability.
But until that day comes, we will have to make ideals and human failure meet somewhere in the middle.
They put their lives on the line, for us, for you, and we cannot let them down.
So how many of you know what I'm talking about?
It can be compiled into this -- into zeros and ones -- and pronounced by a computer.
We understand it so well, in fact, that we think we can actually write programming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers.
It'll approximate that shape. We do this for real in the test tube.
What we really want to do in the end is learn how to program self-assembly so that we can build anything, right?
This is a friction climb, up in Tuolumne Meadows, in the Yosemite high country.
He's actually right about where I fell.
This is a climb called the Dike Route, on Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country.
Fear really sucks because what it means is you're not focusing on what you're doing.
Women are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups.
Well, it's great to be here.
Most regions of the world are moving in that direction.
That invariably, the world was a different place when I would introduce a technology.
There are remarkably smooth exponential curves that govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth.
It took us 15 years to sequence HIV -- we sequenced SARS in 31 days.
Now this is an interesting chart, and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process -- and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes -- accelerate.
We always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation.
And that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth.
That hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum.
Supercomputers -- same thing.
Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses, it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor.
This is due to greater productivity, but the economist says, "But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that.
We're understanding the software programs that make our body run.
So, life -- long lifespans -- like, that is to say, much more than 30 -- weren't selected for, but we are learning to actually manipulate and change these software programs through the biotechnology revolution.
Another major revolution: the communications revolution.
And this is less futuristic than it may sound.
Presumably we'll ban them, but then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms routinely out-performing the Olympic athletes.
And with the new generation of scanning tools, for the first time we can actually see individual inter-neural fibers and see them processing and signaling in real time -- but then the question is, OK, we can get this data now, but can we understand it?
E-commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars.
They'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment.
We are going to merge with our technology.
We routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology.
So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems.
Oh, sorry.
And in fact, I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things.
And sometimes A really is connected to B, and that's called association learning.
Our second type of error is a false negative.
But no harm. You just move away.
And so I think that we evolved ...
For example, what do you see here?
How about here?
Because fielders are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time.
The fish is degraded 20 percent, 50 percent and then the one I showed you, 70 percent.
So dopamine appears to be the drug associated with patternicity.
So perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity.
You think people are talking about you.
Again, I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here, causing you conflicting pattern detections.
Of course, thanks to the environmentalist movement we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals.
So you say, "Aw, come on Shermer, anybody can do that in a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that."
Yet again, your pattern detection devices are fooled.
A fairly famous illusion -- it was first done with Margaret Thatcher.
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator?
The intelligent designer's always portrayed as this super intelligent, moral being that comes down to design life.
And he popped out at the last second, took that shot.
But that's not what the "9/11 truthers" think.
Or you can do it through loss of consciousness, by accelerating in a centrifuge.
This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm.
So this is a blind test.
Take a step here.
The second school I was at had big trees too, had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country, and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it, around the playing fields.
But the thing that really amazed me, that I had no idea, was that you could suffer in this way and then have your whole experience, your story, denied, buried and forgotten.
Life in the camp is never simple. Even today life is difficult.
The other soldier also came.
I fell. They ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead.
No, not at all, no problem, take your time.
WITNESS.
So the question is, where do we start this story?
So this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball.
This is Africa. It's hot.
So our next question then was, how are they doing this?
It does a little double dance, and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went in the first place.
So obviously beetles can see polarized light.
How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves?
Now we thought, now what could be going on here?
So the truth is, if you look at the temperature over here, dung is cool.
Watch how often the beetle dances.
And that's exactly what the beetles are doing here.
There's one more interesting aspect of this dung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating, and that's that it forages and provisions a nest.
And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets.
So here's our cunning experimenter.
Shame.
So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance we can actually learn an awful lot from these things doing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do.
It's okay to applaud the laws of physics, but essentially what's happening here -- -- is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules is influencing the combustion properties of propane, creating a visible waveform, and we can see the alternating regions of compression and rarefaction that we call frequency, and the height is showing us amplitude.
All right, so it's a delicate dance.
This is data from a skate park, and this is Mabel Davis skate park in Austin, Texas.
I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking, and I wanted to use all eight hours of his Cambridge lecture series to create an homage.
Stephen Hawking: There is one, and only one, arrangement in which the pieces make a complete picture.
Sometimes you get a little star applause, and then I think even Bill Gates takes a nervous breath, and the talk begins.
I don't know. It's a theory right now.
So I made a really bad career decision.
And the second, was something one of our teachers told us.
And I thought, what if I took whatever I learned in animation school, and used that to design my robotic desk lamp.
And it's the same structure, just the motion is different.
It was after a Passover seder.
And then the human waits, until it's their turn again.
And this book was kind of waiting for 100 years to be rediscovered for robotics.
Which also talks about the same ideas -- We use our bodies to think, we don't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move.
So I worked for quite a long time on these models and I implemented them on a number of robots.
It waits for its turn, it analyzes everything, it plans.
And they thought it was more intelligent, more committed, a better member of the team, contributed to the success of the team more.
Maybe it's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution.
And so, I tried to do the same things, this time with music, where the robot doesn't really know what it's about to play.
Musicians also communicate with their bodies, with other band members, with the audience, they use their bodies to express the music.
So we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot, which was nice.
And at some point, we are in Atlanta, so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point.
Just to introduce the last robot that we've worked on, that came out of something kind of surprising that we found: At some point people didn't care anymore about the robot being so intelligent, and can improvise and listen, and do all these embodied intelligence things that I spent years on developing.
So, a lot of bobbing head.
And maybe they should be able to anticipate what you're about to do.
The pithiest answer to the question "why?"
And my answer must at once be, it is no use.
That is what life means, and that is what life is for."
I was 26. I remember sitting there looking down at my sledge. I had my skis ready to go, I had a satellite phone, a pump-action shotgun in case I was attacked by a polar bear.
So again, there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had.
I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it, but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on, to ruin every relationship I've ever had, so be careful what you wish for.
There is a sort of misconception nowadays that it's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure.
It will take us about four months to make this return journey.
I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what's outside.
There are business models, and there are financials, and there are markets and there is that. Overall, of all the things that you have to do, what is the single most important thing the VC is going to be investing in?
You actually have to convey about 10 different characteristics while you're standing up there.
DSR: Close enough! Passion.
And "done this before" is starting an enterprise and creating value, and taking something from beginning to end.
So I don't want somebody who's saying, "Hey, I've got a great idea in a business I know nothing about.
So what else do you require?
So I don't want somebody who's going to cut and run at the first opportunity.
Because I need to know that you know that while changing the world is great, it doesn't always happen.
Okay, so how do you convey all these 10 things in 10 minutes without saying any more?
You walk in the door. So the first thing you've got to do -- the overall, you know, arc of your presentation -- it's got to start like a rocket.
And you've got to get better, and better, and better, and better.
Why are you going to do X, Y or Z.
And that's two parts.
And the minute you tell me that -- boom! You know, I discount half of what you're saying from then on.
That shows me that -- if you can't even do a presentation, how the heck can you run a company?
Oh, isn't that funny! There's another great one over here.
What's good? Short, short bullet points.
I looked at the image -- a picture's worth a thousand words.
I don't need all that.
And that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box.
Now, this is not a product pitch, not a sales pitch.
I want to know what the business model is on a sort of per-unit basis, or for the actual product that you're selling.
But then, I want to know how you're special.
You're making X amount per widget.
You're looking for 5 million -- at what kind of valuation?
This is that rocket going up.
You've got to give me the final, you know -- boom! -- the final pitch that's going to send me into space.
No, I'm looking actually at a special version of PowerPoint over here, which shows me the slides ahead, the slides behind, my notes from here, so I can see what's going on.
It helps you pace yourself, it gives you a timer so we end on time and the whole bit.
You want to have a handout that gives a lot more information, because the handout has to stand without you over here.
And I wondered if I could update that game, not just for modern methods, but for the modern me.
And it is really fun to say.
Now in the old days, that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically, maybe getting sidetracked, that was fun.
So to keep the game going, I just have to find another term and look that one up.
This is the most successful order on the planet by far.
Beetles, I was reminded, have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom.
But as the article mentions, because of enzyme breakdown, it's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally.
That's the idea behind voodoo dolls, and possibly also cave paintings.
I click on chimpanzee, and I get our closest genetic relative.
He experienced weightlessness and re-entry months before the first human being to do it, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.
You can come back to Earth.
What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball, if you could take planet Earth, with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests, astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees, voodoo dolls, fireflies, chocolate, sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea, you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball, it would be as smooth as a billiard ball, presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle.
We need a revolution because things aren't working; they're just not working.
And worst of all, it just came out three weeks ago, many of you have seen it, The Economist.
And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies.
It's not.
I said "play," all right.
And instead, what do we value?
We have a serious meme running through.
I'm going to give bebko to baba.
And we said, "Well what about play and recess?"
We create robotic workers that we treat like assets, to lever and just throw away.
In social, in education and in our business, don't value play.
Evolution has selected, over millions and billions of years, for play in animals and in humans.
But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially.
But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players?
We play musical instruments.
We develop more emotional maturity if we play more.
Imagine a world without theater, without the arts, without song, without dancing, without soccer, without football, without laughter.
We have this concept that the opposite of play is work.
For example, it stimulates creativity.
We shouldn't be feeling guilty.
People, service, profit.
Not one customer would refer us.
Through promoting fun and a great environment, we were able to transform Sciant and, in just three short years -- sounds like a long time, but change is slow -- every customer, from zero to every customer referring us, above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders.
Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you, you need to rediscover play.
I'm going to encourage constructive criticism.
Let them be on instant messengers.
We don't need a workers' revolution.
Thank you.
Some of them were new stories.
We've gone to this world of many to many, where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.
He was able to write and publish in relatively short order.
Now Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.
It begins in Elliott's voice, but then Elliott's voice recedes, and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon, characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story, a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.
I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves, but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.
They respond to it.
And then, very interestingly, it came to an end.
I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, "eppasod," presenting them as episodes really, it creates something new.
So with real-time storytelling, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, the real world and the digital world, flexible identity, anonymity, these are all tools that we have accessible to us, and I think that they're just the building blocks.
I have my file which is called To Do. I have my plans.
This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale.
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work.
Let me tell you some about my life.
The work as an apprentice was very primitive.
First I set up a shop in my own garden, and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest.
However, everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department.
And the first day, I was coming to take my place at the turntable -- there were three or four turntables -- and one of them, behind where I was sitting, was a hunchback, a deaf-mute hunchback, who smelled very bad.
Moderator: Yes, I am sure.
And if this is the end of my five minutes, I want to tell you that I actually did survive, which was a surprise.
My archive: 175 films, my 16-millimeter negative, all my books, my dad's books, my photographs.
This was bad! Man, I was -- I cough. I was sick.
These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film, which opens in New York in two weeks downtown.
I came up with this idea: a life of bits and pieces, which I'm just starting to work on -- my next project.
That's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved.
That's my wife, Heidi, who didn't take it as well as I did.
It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways, and those unexpected ways we later reflected on, that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us, and a year later, we launched Babble, a website for parents.
You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble, which we did.
And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this.
RG: So today, what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos.
And I was there with my arms open.
I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.
You're either in love, or you're not in love.
So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.
You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.
And I called my sister whom I'm very close to -- and had three children -- and I asked her, "Why didn't you tell me I was going to be feeling this way, that I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?"
So to take one example among many: in Southern India there's a practice known as jholabhari, in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant, moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies, give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born.
I really wanted to crawl into a hole, and I didn't really know how I was going to work my way back into my surrounding community.
There's not really a lot of community support around it.
I'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day, our first son, Declan, was nine months old, and I was sitting there on the couch, and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, "Stumbling on Happiness."
We said, something is wrong here.
As you get older, you become more stable.
We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments.
And we obviously went forward. We did.
RG: And so this is what -- And we think that a lot of parents, when you get in there -- in our case anyway -- you pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go.
And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can.
And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there.
He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year.
And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about, one in mono, and one in stereo.
We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other.
And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.
And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this, you're inside of Glenn Gould's body.
There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side, and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano.
And at some point he's dancing with his -- and I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967.
The transition will be this one.
You want to hear it played by different musicians.
We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September.
And I want you to hear that right now.
The effect, the payback, perhaps, for years of vampire predators like Bernie Madoff, whom we saw earlier.
I want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from.
And they were people who were not short of wit, or grace or energy, but they had no hope, no jobs, no prospects.
If you look at America, the proportion of Americans with no one to talk to about important things went up from a tenth to a quarter.
And you saw that in the '30s, when the Great Depression paved the way for Bretton Woods, welfare states and so on.
There's a similar story, I think, for governments.
Don't overdo it."
Environmental services, energy services, the myriad of green jobs, they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy which isn't just about products, but is using distributed networks, and it's founded above all on care, on relationships, on what people do to other people, often one to one, rather than simply selling them a product.
And what's striking though, is that in society there's almost nothing comparable, no comparable investment, no systematic experiment, in the things capitalism isn't very good at, like compassion, or empathy, or relationships or care.
It's what we do in the organization named after him where we try and invent, create, launch new ventures, whether it's schools, web companies, health organizations and so on.
Now, the idea that all of this represents, I think, is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis, recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress.
I think what this is all about, this whole movement which is growing from the margins, remains quite small.
But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago, just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France.
And as that happens, we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism, which is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks, it's not a self-sufficient system.
The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics, dating back to at least before Adam Smith.
So all the way over on the left of this graph, what you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year, and some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year.
I grew up in the Midwest of the United States.
All of this information is obligatory. Chinese doesn't let me ignore it.
They can say, "Yesterday it rain," "Now it rain," "Tomorrow it rain."
Could how you speak about time, could how your language forces you to think about time, affect your propensity to behave across time?
But how would you actually go about testing such a theory?
Over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation.
"Excuse me, would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio?
Take all of that data, combine it, and this map is what you get.
It's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in Brussels who are identical on every single one of these dimensions, but one of whom speaks Flemish and one of whom speaks French; or two families that live in a rural district in Nigeria, one of whom speaks Hausa and one of whom speaks Igbo.
Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings.
Ultimately, the goal, once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making, we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future.
I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over 30 years.
It's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations.
That is a little bit too early.
After all, the best education -- according to the latest World University Rankings -- is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S.
They can't pursue their dream any longer, 'til they get English.
"But," I hear you say, "what about the research?
Now don't get me wrong; I am not against teaching English, all you English teachers out there.
He, by the way, was considered remedial at school because he was, in fact, dyslexic.
Now I get it, I understand why people would want to focus on English.
They really didn't know what to do, until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb, whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German.
Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad, we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know, and they know it in their own language.
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark.
The weather modification subject was getting started, and as a graduate student, I could go around to the various talks that were being given, on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast, and so on. And everybody would talk to me, but all the professionals in the field hated each other, and they wouldn't communicate. And as a result, I got the absolutely unique background in that field, and started a company, which did more research in weather modification than anybody, and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into.
You're down to a third of the speed, a third of the power, and a good bicyclist can put out that power, and that worked, and we won the prize a year later.
It turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the debt, so for five years, six years, I only had to pay one third income tax.
But this last time, just coming round, right now, suddenly, there'd be huge changes in the environment, in the concentration of people, and it was just unbelievable, the amount of -- all the change in it.
Ten thousand years ago, the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve.
"Solar Manifesto" by Hermann Scheer, in Germany, claims all energy on Earth can be derived, for every country, from solar energy and water, and so on.
And two weeks after this drawing was done, we actually had our first project contract, at AeroVironment, on robotic cockroaches, which was very frightening to me.
This enables her to easily ride through the air currents as if she's sliding along on the ocean waves.
A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance.
Alan Alda: He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head.
TM: 12, something like that.
So I can do it -- oops, that was going to be a right turn.
I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement, just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century also agrees with us, and also calls us to this action.
It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair.
And he was discontented with the state of people's practice of the Buddhist religion in India at that time.
And he was rubbing it with a cloth.
This time, he comes down.
And he comes to the town. He's a broken person.
And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.
So he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots.
But, being human, he's immediately thinking of his next complaint.
And he said, "If you don't believe me, just take me with you."
And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years, dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion.
I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly.
I've been female, and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life, the way the Buddhists reflect.
And we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important.
And so, we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings.
Nobody seems alien. They're not "other."
And then the fourth step, you go to what is called "lovely love."
But, actually, that's practical.
And you realize how unhappy they are actually, mostly, most of the time.
And they, then, never get any positive feedback.
And in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life.
And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us: we are responsible for that, and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it.
Don't just think, "Well, I'm compassionate," or "I'm not compassionate," and sort of think you're stuck there.
I want you to read this, because we're going to come back to it in a moment.
Why is that important?
And it rests on a complexity, which has some characteristics very different from those that my friend Benoit Mandelbrot discussed, but are very interesting.
It's like, what is simplicity?
And, interestingly, complexity is very highly evolved.
One of the things I want to do is to help you with a very important task -- which you may not know that you have very often -- which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation.
You can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it, but that's a tiny part of the chemical reactions going on in each of your cells at any given moment.
That's a Bono, this is a Bono.
And I'm going to use as an example the Internet, because it's a particularly good example of stacked simplicity.
You can catch errors with it, it's unambiguous in its reading, there are lots of good things about binary.
So the second layer of simplicity was the transistor in the Internet.
And from that comes the Internet.
Their behavior is predictable.
What that means is that you have to have a high performance or value for cost.
Now, the example is something that I want to give you from the work that we ourselves do.
You know, no power required.
And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem.
But it does make a point -- which is one which, in a sense, differentiates the real world of people who make things, and the world of people who think about things, which is, there is an intellectual merit to asking: How do we make things as simple as we can, as cheap as we can, as functional as we can and as freely interconnectable as we can?
How do I put that simply? No.
Because traditional economic theory would say, well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R&amp;D lab where they were thinking up new projects, and it came out of there. It didn't come from there.
That's 58 billion dollars.
They can say "yes" or "no" to the invention.
The ideas are coming back from the consumers, and they're often ahead of the producers.
All of our patents, our entire approach to patents and invention, is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for; we can say what it's for.
You're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder.
30 years later, rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture -- would never have come from the big companies.
Why, we found, people were interested in this, is that at work they don't feel very expressed.
The users can be producers.
And so the debates about copyright, digital rights, so on and so forth -- these are all about trying to stifle, in my view, these kinds of organizations.
There'll be huge professional arguments as well.
Shock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers.
The first is: can we really survive on volunteers?
It won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux -- there'll be all sorts of things in between.
At any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games.
If, for some reason, your credit card bounces, or there's some other problem, you lose your character.
If you're a games company, and you've got a million players in your game, you only need one percent of them to be co-developers, contributing ideas, and you've got a development workforce of 10,000 people.
Do you see?
It's pretty incredible -- the video's online.
This is project called Ray.
I'm about to whip somebody's ass Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass Oh, if you don't leave me alone, you gonna have to send me home 'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass Now you might not be able to sing that out loud, but you can hum it to yourself, and you know what the words are.
And I asked my audience, I said, "Listen to this piece of audio.
So that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in Kansas City.
It's been an interesting two weeks."
And this is it, right, to feel and be felt.
A Childhood Walk, which is a project where I ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless -- like on the route to the bus stop, to a neighbor's house, and take it inside of Google Streetview.
He died long after he left the pillow at my house, but we never got around to returning it."
But sometimes I feel really lonely.
Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation."
But the truth was that as this start becoming popular, a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing, which I could also see.
But this was the emotional moment.
So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point, and she actually was singing that song to herself.
One person sent me a very detailed description; the other person didn't.
So I asked her, "What does it feel like when you feel this way?"
And when you put them together, something magical happens, something absolutely incredible happens, and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world.
But then, for some reason, I got into something else, just recently.
And what came up was a number of pieces of data.
So there is the pattern that every one of them had, but they all were a little different too.
So this is how it's passed from mother to son.
And if I was a young girl, somewhere in a violent area, you know, a 14 year old, and I want to find a mate, I'd find some tough guy, right, to protect me.
Now she blamed this on my father's side, of course.
Okay, so that's the first case of matricide.
And we had to take action. Now our kids found out about it.
And we don't know where it's going to pop up.
We collide them inside giant detectors.
And, again, a EU standard-size, real person, so you get some sense of the scale.
And by everything I mean, of course, me and you, the Earth, the Sun, the 100 billion suns in our galaxy and the 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe.
It's almost like ...
But, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.
One of the wonderful things, actually, I find, is that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.
It's the Newton's laws, if you want, of particle physics.
Can anyone see what it is?
Higgs particles have not been discovered.
Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.
It's almost like they get heavy. They get massive.
So that's one thing.
But they just miss.
And I'd say that it deserves, in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk, to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen, 25 percent helium. It still is today.
And built this civilization, this wonderful picture, that turned the darkness into light, and you can see the civilization from space.
So that's the LHC.
When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers, I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science, to find a more useful truth.
The good news is that we're actually born smiling.
Outside of this room, more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day, whereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five.
In addition to theorizing on evolution in "The Origin of Species," Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory.
That's like 25 grand a smile.
I still paint. I love art.
The French E.U. official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting.
The rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost.
Thirty-seven said no, we don't like it.
"Come on, man! What policemen?
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets.
"I'm convinced," I told a German official with the World Bank, "that it would be impossible for them to be bribed if they worked in Germany, in a German administration, just as I am convinced that if you put German officials from the German administration in those holes, they would be bribed just the same."
The corruption in the state administration of countries like Albania -- it's not up to me to say also like Greece -- can be fought only by modernization.
I love it because it lets me get the message out, but it also lets people get their messages to me.
We can all change the world.
The catalyst for this change was the major earthquake that struck Haiti on the 12th of January in 2010.
Haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future of what disaster response might look like in a hyper-connected world where people have access to mobile smart devices.
On street sides all over Port-au-Prince, entrepreneurs sprung up offering mobile phone charging stations.
And we wanted it to be easy to use.
Those who were intended to receive the data, 74 percent of them received it.
One illustration of the transformational power of technology is in Kibera.
You can find out about the latest security incident.
And we're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories.
The U.N. broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in 50 percent of the Developing World, compared to 20 percent today.
We need technology as a core organizational principle.
I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy, and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me.
I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.
We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless.
Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time: a long arc of time that is our lifespan, and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment.
Science can do things with and in a picosecond, but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second.
News from India is a stream on my smartphone app whether I'm in New York or New Delhi.
Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else.
And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror.
For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it, the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous.
What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact, but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact.
The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one.
The digital world cannibalizes time, and in doing so, I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves.
Stories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence, but that are never sentimental, that never look away from the darkest things about us.
I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window.
My parents met in Oxford in the '50s, and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there.
And she shook her head and said, "Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language, why don't they use it?"
And when my father complained about this situation, where she's taking a seven-year-old boy to teach this birth control, you know, he used to say, "Oh, you're turning him into -- you're teaching him how to be a woman."
And she told this woman.
And then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge, they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born.
Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women, that's essentially what it is.
My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human until we started keeping goats.
Just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult."
It's your birthday present."
And he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books -- "Spiderman" and "X-Men."
Then I'd say, "How do you know?"
But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice, the Igbos would destroy the god.
"Libation, North Carolina, 1999.
Thank you.
If you take a close-up of those, they look like this.
And then what happens is there's enough dust left over that it doesn't ignite into a star, it becomes a planet.
The first theory of the case is that's all she wrote.
Second theory is: Could we upgrade?
Wouldn't it be really odd if you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica and found exactly the same bird -- particularly given that we co-existed at the same time with at least eight other versions of humanoid at the same time on this planet?
And those are the specific genes that differ from one to the other.
That was partly based on Francis Galton's work.
Because nobody's ever climbed an 8,000-meter peak without oxygen that doesn't have an ACE gene.
If these differences are the difference between an Olympic medal and a non-Olympic medal.
So they go down one side of the mountain, they go down another.
Here's a second experiment: If you could photocopy your body, maybe you also want to take your mind.
So what's the bottom line on that?
Do we have any evidence that that is happening?
You've got all kinds of stuff going on out there, and we still don't understand how and why this is happening.
These conditions are highly rare.
Here's the bottom line.
I'd like to tell you a little bit about the challenges in building these and some of the terrific opportunities for applying this technology.
The robot I'm holding in my hand is this one, and it's been created by two students, Alex and Daniel.
So to get it to tilt, there's one of two ways of doing it.
It's actually half the diameter.
At the bottom right you see a robot performing a 360 degree flip in less than half a second.
You can also use them for applications like construction.
So this gets a little challenging because the dynamics of this robot are quite complicated.
And it does that avoiding obstacles.
And here you'll see Daniel throw this hoop into the air, while the robot is calculating the position of the hoop and trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop.
And I told you earlier that we may want to employ lots and lots of robots to overcome the limitations of size.
But because they sense the neighbors and because they sense the object, they have implicit coordination across the group.
So this is what we call anonymity.
As you can see in this figure-eight flight, they come within inches of each other.
So his algorithm tells the robot what part to pick up, when and where to place it.
So there is no global coordinate system.
So suppose I were to send this into a building and I had no idea what this building looked like, I can ask this robot to go in, create a map and then come back and tell me what the building looks like.
I want to conclude with a music video.
Now, this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees, maybe insects, or maybe anything that has more legs than two.
This is called colony collapse disorder, and it's bizarre. Researchers around the globe still do not know what's causing it, but what we do know is that, with the declining numbers of bees, the costs of over 130 fruit and vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price.
The way that urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden, and it's not because they need to be.
What about in 100 years, if we have green rooftops everywhere, and gardening, and we create our own crops right in the cities? We save on the costs of transportation, we save on a healthier diet, and we also educate and create new jobs locally.
Furthermore, they also produce more honey.
Why are bees doing better in the city?
Now, the varroa mite is what changed the game in beekeeping, and you can see, at the top right, the years are changing, we're coming up to modern times, and you can see the spread of the varroa mite from the early 1900s through now.
So, what I do is honeybee research.
You just mix up some pollen, sugar and water, and whatever active ingredient you want to put in, and you just give it right to the bees. No chemicals involved, just immune boosters.
I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives, because they can be anything.
The bees fly right into the outfield of Fenway Park.
Now, this was a mystery in the New York Times where the honey was very red, and the New York State forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street.
A bee isn't going to sting you if you see it.
And that is bread -- something which is as simple as our basic, most fundamental human staple.
One is a supermarket standard: white bread, pre-packaged, which I'm told is called a Wonderbread.
It's about a traditional way of living.
And we have this mythical image of how life was in rural areas in the past.
And it actually drove up our yields.
And don't despise the white bread because it really, I think, symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all.
And that is the result, directly, of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production.
So as food became more plentiful, bread became cheaper.
Bread has migrated to tropical countries, where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava.
How many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals?
The counter-movement says, "Let's go back to this.
We cannot just think that small-scale is the solution to the world food problem.
The main driver of that is actually meat.
You cannot ask people to work under these conditions.
What you see is that we've started in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture, which was sort of small-scale and low-control.
So what kind of science can we have?
There are different ways in which we must use it -- for residential, for nature, for agriculture purposes.
And the main thing that I would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries, or as you stay here: ask your government for an integrated food policy.
Talk to people in restaurants.
Never before, as I said, has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few.
Let me share some of the food with you.
So enjoy your bread.
And the devices usually available to these people are not made for that context, break down quickly, and are hard to repair.
But when you get home or want to go indoors at your work, it's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside.
So seeing this in practice, this is the Leveraged Freedom Chair that, after a few years of development, we're now going into production with, and this is a full-time wheelchair user -- he's paralyzed -- in Guatemala, and you see he's able to traverse pretty rough terrain.
So I'm an academic at MIT, and I'm a mechanical engineer, so I can do things like look at the type of terrain you want to travel on, and figure out how much resistance it should impose, look at the parts we have available and mix and match them to figure out what sort of gear trains we can use, and then look at the power and force you can get out of your upper body to analyze how fast you should be able to go in this chair as you put your arms up and down the levers.
And the final point I want to make is that I think this project worked well because we engaged all the stakeholders that buy into this project and are important to consider in bringing the technology from inception of an idea through innovation, validation, commercialization and dissemination, and that cycle has to start and end with end users.
And this picture was taken in India in our last field trial, where we had a 90-percent adoption rate where people switched to using our Leveraged Freedom Chair over their normal wheelchair, and this picture specifically is of Ashok, and Ashok had a spinal injury when he fell out of a tree, and he had been working at a tailor, but once he was injured he wasn't able to transport himself from his house over a kilometer to his shop in his normal wheelchair.
Because that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you.
And my mother, brave lady, was partly to blame, taking me to the New York Natural History Museum, buying me books on snakes, and then starting this infamous career of mine, which has culminated in of course, arriving in India 60 years ago, brought by my mother, Doris Norden, and my stepfather, Rama Chattopadhyaya.
Here is a limbless animal, capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves, and then laying her eggs inside, to withstand 5 to 10 [meters of rainfall], in order that the eggs can incubate over the next 90 days, and hatch into little baby king cobras.
This is basically a base wherein we are trying to gather and learn virtually everything about the biodiversity of this incredibly complex forest system, and try to hang on to what's there, make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean, and of course, having a good time too.
And it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom, and was hanging around there for two or three days.
And king cobras feed only on snakes.
It's very much like the rutting of mammals, including humans, you know, sorting out our differences, but gentler, no biting allowed.
And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged.
And the thing is, it's not just big industry.
Even though it grows to 20 feet long, since it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings.
But complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt.
Suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river, dead.
And it's a horribly painful death.
It's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know about the bandits, the dacoits who used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around.
So, we all know about the Narmada river, the tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects which displace people and wreck river systems without providing livelihoods.
So, we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project.
And the final word is that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders.
How do you really get them to care?
RW: Yes, this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it, for one thing.
Thanks Rom. Thank you.
They're powerful tools for transformation, for quieting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy, to be peaceful, to be joyful and to realize that it's not something that you pursue and get, but rather it's something that you have already until you disturb it.
And in our studies, what we've been able to do is to use very expensive, high-tech, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost -- and in many ways, ancient -- interventions, can be.
Clinically, he literally couldn't walk across the street without getting severe chest pain; within a month, like most people, was pain-free, and within a year, climbing more than 100 floors a day on a Stairmaster.
You just never know.
I like this slide, because it's a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change, and what doesn't.
And the pain is not the problem: it's the symptom.
So does cocaine, so does a high fat diet, so does emotional stress.
And the paradox is that when you make big changes, you get big benefits, and you feel so much better so quickly.
but it doesn't last, which is the problem.
You know, I don't like talking about the Atkins diet, but I get asked about it every day, and so I just thought I'd spend a few minutes on that.
So, and you get all the disease-protective substances.
Now, the problem with the Atkins diet, everybody knows people who have lost weight on it, but you can lose weight on amphetamines, you know, and fen-phen.
So, yes, you can lose weight, but your heart isn't happy.
So, there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health.
I then wondered, well, maybe they're just changing their PSA, but it's not really affecting the tumor growth.
And depression is treatable. We need to do something about that.
They just met once a week for a year.
To me, it's just shorthand for what we're talking about: that anything that creates a sense of connection and community and love is really healing.
but you seem to have more hair.
BP: I heard momma and Tizzy whisper, and they said I was gonna die soon.
Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body.
It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.
It happened to be this guy.
Sounded great.
And we did it in about five weeks.
So we started to have early team meetings, and we got everybody together, and it was really more like therapy in the beginning, convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this.
So, when you're faced with something like that, of course you've got to break it down.
We did about 325 shots.
You can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers.
So we aborted using motion capture.
And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS.
And if you look in a comparison, on the left, we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us.
This is when we're like, "OK, we're going to be OK, This is actually going to work."
And we commissioned them to make a maquette, or a bust, of Benjamin.
And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin in the computer.
So while all that's going on, we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world.
We encouraged him to improvise.
And so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from.
The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this, because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides.
We worked from dental molds of Brad.
So, lots of work on skin deformation, you can see in some of these cases it works, in some cases it looks bad.
So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.
Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this.
The couple are barely 18 years old.
The cubs, which are taken, are separated.
And now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway.
Education. The kids never went to school.
So, basically in 2002 there were 1,200 dancing bears.
And the children, both humans and bear cubs can live peacefully. Thank you.
And that's where the hyena comes in.
And we were in the desert -- Richard Wurman: That's the end of this talk!
And they said, "Ah, no problem! We just get out and walk."
There's also one other aspect about these camels.
And he kind of went, "Nah. I don't think we want to be bringing a camel."
It is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut.
So we'll need to be very careful around him. Don't let him get you.
The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold.
They're like sun shoes, but, you know, with sand.
I don't know if you've read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants -- you know what I mean, like, "Br-r-r!"
And it makes him very dangerous at this time of year.
That way the camel can dip its tail in the stream, and just whacker the entire area around him.
But before I do, I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand, the ship of the desert. It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found -- largely Mongolia and Sahara -- that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel.
The perfect desert machine.
And my hump?
But go without for more than a month.
No surprise.
And I think when you look at the animal kingdom, that is one of the most remarkable things.
It's a great way to start sentences.
I think more influential than Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworth on my imagination were Warner Brothers, Merrie Melodies and Loony Tunes cartoons.
So let us start with the first one.
One of my students came up after class, an introductory class, and she said, "You know, poetry is harder than writing," which I found both erroneous and profound.
Some days I put the people in their places at the table, bend their legs at the knees, if they come with that feature, and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs.
The name of the author is the first to go, followed obediently by the title, the plot, the heartbreaking conclusion, the entire novel, which suddenly becomes one you have never read, never even heard of.
He lived, and still does, in rural Vermont.
I wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike-anywhere matches just lying around the house, because the mice might get into them and start a fire.
And that to me was a bad start to the afterlife, having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified.
But then again, it took us a long time to put the wheel and the suitcase together.
So never mind; you're fine just being yourself.
We think you're special just being you -- playing with your food and staring into space.
Much later, as a student, I went to a very different garden, a zoological garden in Arnhem where we keep chimpanzees.
They ended up in a tree, and one of them holds out a hand to the other.
The principle is that you have a valuable relationship that is damaged by conflict, so you need to do something about it.
So these are the pillars of morality.
So this is already about a hundred years ago that we were doing experiments on cooperation.
So one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore.
And so that's how this all operates.
And the first tape you're going to see is two elephants who are released together arrive at the apparatus.
And so what we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other, and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope -- because if he pulls at the rope, it disappears and the whole test is over.
Now something on empathy.
Your average dog has that also.
It activates the same areas in the brain.
Now we also study more complex expressions. This is consolation.
Now we did a very simple experiment.
So they have a whole bucket full of them.
So she gives us now a pro-social token and both chimps get fed.
And this is what happens without a partner, when there's no partner sitting there.
So what we did is we put two capuchin monkeys side-by-side.
The one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber.
And she gets a grape and she eats it.
They didn't like this at all.
I think morality is much more than what I've been talking about, but it would be impossible without these ingredients that we find in other primates, which are empathy and consolation, pro-social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness.
Now, notice that the leader embraces him as an equal.
It's important to show not just to show the leader, but the followers, because you find that new followers emulate the followers, not the leader.
But let's recap some lessons from this.
Thanks.
It was painful at times, especially for those around me.
And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard -- because Leviticus says you cannot shave.
And I just finished a couple of months ago.
This was no small feat, because if you listen to dermatologists, they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.
I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council.
All of the markers went in the right direction.
I went to the dark side, and I just indulged myself.
Let me just tell you two really quickly.
And they estimated that 1.6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution.
And just to give you one instance of this: food.
It's called "Drop Dead Healthy."
A few years ago, my colleagues and I were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people's decisions in social situations.
And I thought the same thing myself when these came out, because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate.
When the headlines rolled, what happened was, the marketers came calling.
So I went to the company's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products.
So the take-home message here is, do you want to sell it? Put a brain on it.
It quickly became the most emailed article on the site.
My colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published.
Other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy. It increases gloating.
These scans, the clinics say, can help prevent Alzheimer's disease, solve weight and addiction issues, overcome marital conflicts, and treat, of course, a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD.
We haven't found a "buy" button inside the brain, we can't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans, and we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones.
I'd like to begin with a thought experiment.
And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers -- buried in the hills somewhere in North America -- massive versions of these same symbols.
Here's an example of one of these objects.
Now we don't know if it says Hollywood, or even Bollywood for that matter.
Or maybe that big?
Perhaps they're the name of the sender or some information about the goods that are being sent from one place to the other -- we don't know.
There's a last group of people who believe that the Indus people were the ancestors of people living in South India today.
And furthermore, we don't even know what language they spoke.
But in 2007, my path crossed again with the Indus script.
I'll give you a couple of seconds.
What other properties of language does the script show?
And this is very similar to a Q and U example.
You may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of Wheel of Fortune.
Now here's one other thing you can do with the computer model.
Language, on the other hand, has an intermediate level of entropy; it's neither too rigid, nor is it too random.
When this result was first published, it was highly controversial.
Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages.
We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found, and it turns out that they were found very, very far away from the Indus Valley.
The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the Indus script probably does represent language.
Okay. Great.
Here's a really short text.
So that was pretty exciting.
The Indus civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the Pakistanis; it belongs to all of us.
We've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives, from the speculative images of science fiction to the inspirational visions of artists to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies.
This is a a highly condensed clump of neutral matter, spinning in the distant universe.
It's punctuated by three quick anecdotes, which show how accidental encounters with strange noises gave us some of the most important information we have about space.
We didn't have the technology to transmit.
Fast-forward 50 years, and Bell and Watson's technology has completely transformed global communications.
Now any astronomer will tell you, this is the telltale sign of something that doesn't originate from Earth.
There was a glitch in their soundtrack.
This was the first experimental evidence that the Big Bang existed and the universe was born at a precise moment some 14.7 billion years ago.
So he was hanging out with the movie star, and of course they were grumbling: "He's supposed to be religious and all this.
He made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected.
Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do, a little bit tired, we do suffer.
And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it's you versus the universe -- that's all Buddha discovered.
How awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching.
Too bad nobody ever woke up to it, and they've been trying to suppress it since then.
And then it's never good enough.
And so then he looks at me.
Because when you open up like that, then you can't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery?
But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did.
It is Nirvana.
This is Neda, the Iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran only a few weeks ago, and she is now the focus, rightly so, of the YouTube generation.
The reply was, "No, Mr President, he's an anti-communist."
They protested across Britain.
Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago.
100 years ago in most countries in Europe, the pressure was for the right to vote.
Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all.
So the great project of our generation, it seems to me, is to build for the first time, out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together, a truly global society, built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future.
So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility, not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years.
She herself was suffering from HIV; she was suffering from tuberculosis.
It said "David, age 10."
So we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid, but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world.
Thank you.
Now if we want to design a foot, what do we have to do?
You need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work.
Now it turns out that animals can go anywhere.
And in fact, the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot.
It's acting, again, as a distributed foot -- very effective.
It walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can't be seen.
Can this help us inspire the design of novel robots?
Really simple, but beautiful.
Did you touch it?
We can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out.
Dan Koditschek put some steel nails -- very simple version -- on the robot, and here's RHex, now, going over those steel -- those rails. No problem!
One of the ones I'm passing around is climbing up this vertical surface that's a smooth metal plate.
This is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself.
Mark Cutkosky at Stanford University, one of my collaborators, is an extraordinary engineer who developed this technique called Shape Deposition Manufacturing, where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot.
Watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich.
It certainly helps it to hold on.
And when you watch how they detach it, it is bizarre.
So to our blueprint, we split some hairs.
This is an undergraduate volunteer -- we have 30,000 undergraduates so we can choose among them -- that's actually just a red pen mark.
I call the new robot RiSE, for "Robot in Scansorial Environment" -- that's a climbing environment -- and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot.
He's the one able to build this shape-deposition manufactured feet and toes.
It's sped up -- again, it's a foot climbing.
That nature uses hybrid solutions, not a single solution, to these problems, and they're integrated and beautifully robust.
Our vision, which works so well in air, all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic.
And I mentioned I'll use some visual representations of sounds.
So it's a puzzle: The few other mammal groups that do this, why do they do it?
Well let's look at mothers and calves.
As these two animals form a social bond, their distinctive whistles actually converge and become very similar.
This is a bad situation.
When we think of marine-protected areas for animals like dolphins, this means that we have to be quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign.
To me, the most mind-bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean comes from an acoustic experiment where oceanographers took a ship to the southern Indian Ocean, deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound.
The top plot here shows a complicated series of calls that are repeated by males.
This shows us both that the calls are detectable over hundreds of miles and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles.
In '95 they all sang the normal song.
You sound very nearby.
There's a lot of noise, which is mostly other whales.
And on the y-axis is the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean by frequency.
It's louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers.
I'll describe a couple strategies.
It's an amazing shift, induced by humans over this large scale, in both time and space.
If you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull, you can reduce that noise by 99 percent.
These black lines mark shipping lanes in and out of the Bay of Fundy.
We can be very creative about thinking of different ways to reduce these risks.
So to conclude, I'd just like to point out, you know, the whales live in an amazing acoustic environment.
And I want to urge you, when you get a chance, to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs.
We can see across the entire spectrum of light, revealing worlds that had previously been invisible.
And third, you can create your own tours -- you can share them with friends, you can create them with friends -- and that's the part that I think I'm most excited about because I think that at heart, we are all storytellers.
Thank you.
It's a labor of love for us and our small team, and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe.
So what's the data?
First, it's a new fear of intimacy.
They don't know the language of face contact, the non-verbal and verbal set of rules that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else, listen to somebody else.
Drug addiction, you simply want more.
And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America -- 15 billion annually.
No offense to banana slug owners. Thank you.
However, the approach I built here is actually high-resolution, low-cost, and probably most importantly, very scalable.
Google should have something like this in their lobby.
Again, the interface just disappears here.
We have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces should start conforming to us.
It's pressure-sensitive, you can notice.
I can switch to different data views. That's what's neat about this app here.
And when I close it, it becomes a character.
This kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it, and I'm really looking forward to interacting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields.
And secondly, because what I'm going to say is true, and it will make a lot of people nervous because it's something we don't want to hear.
I think there's consensus on this.
We are a country of victims.
Hold on! Wait a minute!
Today, much of Mexican society is in denial of the situation we're going through.
And that recognition will sow fear -- recognizing the seriousness of the situation.
So streets become more desolate and unsafe, so we stay home more -- which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe, and we stay home even more.
Recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 35 public lynchings have been recorded so far in 2010 in Mexico.
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico.
Seven days later, Eric was set free and was able to return home.
He keeps mobilizing.
That devotion we show in helping victims of disasters, such as the earthquake in 1985 or this year's floods.
Masiosare, the strange enemy, is here.
But we are many more.
I started juggling a long time ago, but long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer.
But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere, I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not.
Well, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff.
Juggling three balls is simple and normal.
But you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way.
So, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers?
Same pattern.
Enough of a clue? So, you get the pattern, right? OK.
Actually, let me put you in that area of learning, which is very insecure.
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.
So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do, but in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it.
Finger, finger, finger, pink or finger.
You've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life. OK?
Well, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment.
Time. How can you look at time?
Are we ready to do that? Yes?
To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen.
And they influenced that, and this next piece, which I'll do a little segment of.
I'm actually leading up to something, the newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it.
Talking about geometry and everything, if you take the circle and you split it in half -- can you run "S-Curve music?"
And what it involves, and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not, but I'll do a little bit of it.
Let's see here.
And so thinking back, I was thinking those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects -- certainly technological objects.
Maybe you've seen them in the airports? They seem to be everywhere now.
But firms like ours are having to move to a point where we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion, showing how they'll be used.
So, there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags: there's RF tags on the user, on the cards, there's the staff devices that are all around the store.
And then one of my favorite features of the technology is the magic mirror, where you put on the clothes.
And then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it.
He's always been interested in technology in the future.
The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens for the computer and for family photos.
So this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time.
It's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye, started by Nigel Jagger in London.
It can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate, and is equipped with powerful lights.
And he noticed that for weddings and funerals there they could find enough money to put something together.
So with seed-squeezers, and pumps, and hay-balers and very straightforward things that we're designing -- my students are doing this as class projects and IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work -- it's really amazing to see his success, Martin's.
There is more of it than you think, actually.
And the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears.
Try as he might, he couldn't get away from her.
I wrote Horse Face on her, so you'd remember who she was."
Consciousness. I see all your faces.
With artificial intelligence, not only have they not created artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created artificial stupidity.
Geneticists will know this, but every year since, it's been revised downwards.
Time, nobody can see time.
Another thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang.
Okay. Atoms, you can't see them.
There is so many things that -- Light.
Galaxies, 100 billion of them estimated in the universe.
And that's what they do, radio. That's what they discovered.
And to help you, I've got two things to leave you with, from two great philosophers, perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century, one a mathematician and an engineer, and the other a poet.
And we cogitated about this for about four years.
Now the problem is there's an X-axis for that, which is the practical axis.
EL Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from.
And what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data.
Now Google, and Jon Orwant in particular, told us a little equation that we should learn.
We do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books, and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing.
How to know?
Now this is just two out of two billion rows.
Pretty much for the vast majority of history, no one gave a damn about 1950.
Finally in 1954, someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat passé.
So for those of you who seek to be famous, we can learn from the 25 most famous political figures, authors, actors and so on.
But guess what, nobody will really care.
Here's a simple way to do it.
What you expect is basically what you observe.
Except genomics is a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome.
And so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its n-gram immediately -- also browse examples of all the various books in which your n-gram appears.
EL People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes.
JM: There are many usages of this data, but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized.
We are losing our listening.
We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal, and especially our name.
When I married my wife, I promised her that I would listen to her every day as if for the first time.
So, "Sonority is time and meaning" -- a great quote.
We're becoming impatient.
Because listening is our access to understanding.
Second, I call this the mixer.
This, for example, is my tumble dryer.
The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these, if you just take one thing away.
You can use this in listening, in communication.
And if we can teach listening in our schools, we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous, scary world that I talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time -- or at least capable of doing it.
And if they didn't take the flower, I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away.
I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting for the music business on this box.
People would bring home-cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us. This is in Seattle.
And that night, her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds.
Is this what stupid people do?
It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat.
And I was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?"
And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible, so it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad; Amanda Palmer over here, and I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing, but I'm going to ask for help, because I saw it work on the street.
And through the very act of asking people, I'd connected with them, and when you connect with them, people want to help you.
Because they weren't with us on the sidewalk, and they couldn't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd, an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them.
It's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough.
What if we started asking, "How do we let people pay for music?"
So when I had my TED wish last year, I said, look, I'm going to switch my concept.
This is the size.
Boom! This is what happened.
She organized a TEDx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town.
Do you know what it takes to do this?
Here they even got the help of the firemen.
It's everywhere.
And you know what? It's just the beginning.
I'm going to talk all about that.
This is not a real brain. This is a picture of one, a line drawing.
I thought the word framework was great.
But I was a little disappointed -- pretty young -- but I went back again a few years later and this time was in California, and I went to Berkeley.
And I said, I want to do this for four years, make some money, like I was having a family, and I would mature a bit, and maybe the business of neuroscience would mature a bit.
But sometimes, a science has some other attributes which makes it really, really interesting.
Well, let's first take a look at what normal science looks like.
A lot of data. But there's no theory. There's a little, wimpy box on top there.
This is actually a symptom of the fact that we just don't have a theory.
In fact, it looks like it's the same thing repeated over and over and over again.
I've got this experience, I'm in the world, you know.
First of all, they had a lot of unexplained data. A lot of it.
In the case of the solar system, the idea that the Earth is spinning and the surface of the Earth is going like a thousand miles an hour, and the Earth is going through the solar system about a million miles an hour.
All the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around on top of the Earth, you know? It's like, it doesn't make any sense.
And Alan Turing defined the Turing test, which is essentially saying, we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human.
The word came into you, and you're making these predictions all the time.
But we don't consider the alligator very intelligent, not like in a human sort of way.
The old brain is still there. You still have that alligator brain.
It allows you to, literally it feeds back the signals into your brain; they'll let you see what's going to happen next, will let you hear the word "sentence" before I said it.
So we are now able to make very sophisticated motor planning, things like that.
Now I could change your doorknob in other ways.
You're constantly making predictions about your environment.
Every single moment. And finally, let's think about how we test intelligence.
Then, if in that framework, you take a bunch of theoreticians.
I'm really, really excited. This is not going to take 50 years at all.
It's an automatic playback. And prediction of future inputs is the desired output.
And we're going to attach these memories to sensors, and the sensors will experience real-live, real-world data, and these things are going to learn about their environment.
Anywhere where we're basically using our brain, but not doing a lot of mechanics.
So I think that's all my time, I'm over it, and I'm going to end my talk right there.
It is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives, where these people have enough access to education and health care, so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear.
It is not getting other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them.
and take action to make it happen, unless we begin to believe that all of the things that we've been hearing about in these last two days are elements of what come together to make human security.
We're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak, and he leans over to me, and he says, "Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk."
I think what we need is action."
She said, "You know, we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country.
And instead of going home, she conferred with all the other women that she works with, who said to her, "Stay out. We need you out.
But if they were together planting trees for the environment, it was okay -- creativity.
There was a mother and three children.
She is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy, about how you bring democracy to the country, about educating, about how to vote -- but that democracy is not just about voting; it's about being an active citizen.
It's hard work every single day.
And now she was going to watch electricity do that work.
Today, in Sweden and other rich countries, people are using so many different machines.
They have electricity, but the question is, how many have washing machines?
And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the laundry at home, or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off.
And some of them proudly raise their hand and say, "I don't use a car."
That's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is.
What are the trends? If we just prolong the trends, without any real advanced analysis, to 2050, there are two things that can increase the energy use.
And these people, they want the washing machine.
It's real.
She's very happy about her minister of energy that provided electricity to everyone -- so happy that she even voted for her.
Because this is the magic: you load the laundry, and what do you get out of the machine?
Thank you steel mill.
Nowadays, Adam and Eve would probably act differently.
Well, we conjecture that the result of this combination of technologies will be a radical change in our very notions of privacy and anonymity.
We started from social media data, we combined it statistically with data from U.S. government social security, and we ended up predicting social security numbers, which in the United States are extremely sensitive information.
What will this future without secrets look like?
But in fact, privacy is not about having something negative to hide.
But think again. Why should that be always the case?
Now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight.
Transparency. Notification. And sure enough, this worked, in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second.
Fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups disclose the same amount of information, as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers.
In other words, we can have the benefits of big data while protecting privacy.
They become aware. They achieve autonomy.
In "Brave New World," he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing us.
They have what I called "logorrhea dementia," which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane.
Another case: Last election cycle, I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire, and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons: Bip, Chip, Rip, Zip, Lip and Dip.
We invaded Iraq with a military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities.
And it's led to a view of human nature that we're rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives, and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is.
You see these cars that drive up -- usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos, because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car, so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy -- that's fine.
They buy these seaweed-based snacks there called Veggie Booty with Kale, which is for kids who come home and say, "Mom, mom, I want a snack that'll help prevent colon-rectal cancer."
And so they hire personal trainers; they're popping Cialis like breath mints.
And I think when you synthesize this research, you start with three key insights.
The second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking.
And the brain scans were identical in both activities.
When we watch a car chase in a movie, it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase.
When we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily -- things like grades, SAT's, degrees, the number of years in schooling.
In the United States, 55 percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with Mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people.
So for example, we are overconfidence machines.
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity.
And that comes in tremendously handy, because groups are smarter than individuals.
And these are skills, again, we can't count and measure.
When their kids were five and two, Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly.
And now as we confront that shallowness and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are, comes this revolution in consciousness -- these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted, this new humanism.
By the time we got the information, we reached there, Pranitha was already raped by three men.
In this country, and across the globe, hundreds and thousands of children, as young as three, as young as four, are sold into sexual slavery.
I don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it.
Most of them come from very optionless families, not just poor.
But the rest, who succumb into it, go through everyday torture.
We think the person likes to do what she's doing.
It's in that context that I rescue children.
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder.
And each one of them are excelling in their chosen field, gaining confidence, restoring dignity, and building hopes in their own lives.
My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own.
It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.
Many times when I talk to people, I keep telling them one thing: don't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem.
Because they are also a part of us.
How about this word?
But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy."
And for another, deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy.
Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.
And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!
You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!
This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!
Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.
The bad words -- see, when people think about a place and they don't find a place on the map, they think, "This map sucks!"
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.
What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals, and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?
And so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?"
Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop -- the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection, or the cars get confused. Right?
And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs -- and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time.
That's a lexicographical cop out, to say, "miscellaneous technical senses."
We're missing California from American English.
And there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.
Now, y'all know where I'm going with this.
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact.
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.
I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.
Two years ago at TED, I think -- I've come to this conclusion -- I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion.
The date was February 2000.
And worse than that, far worse than that, my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating.
And at about the same time, and I think partly because of that, I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus: I started to read again.
But something as basic as happiness, which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue, today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions that you can ask about it, which are really interesting.
To understand even something as important to us as happiness, you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions, and there's nowhere that I've discovered -- other than TED -- where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions.
Number one: do nothing. This thing ain't broke, so I ain't gonna fix it.
There's a year to do this, and already -- I hope to show you a bit later -- there's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year.
And then, fourthly: I want to mention the Sapling Foundation, which is the new owner of TED.
He was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington, he was engaged to Gretchen, about to be married, she was the love of his life.
So what would you do at this point?
He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.
I study memory. I've studied memory for decades.
Well, why?
In one study, we showed people a simulated accident and we asked people, how fast were the cars going when they hit each other?
And when we feed them suggestive information that insinuates it's a different person, many of them misidentify their interrogator, often identifying someone who doesn't even remotely resemble the real interrogator.
And when I began looking into these cases, I was wondering, where do these bizarre memories come from?
But we and other investigators have planted rich false memories of things that were much more unusual and much more stressful.
And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story to be filmed and presented in public places.
And we found that once we planted this false memory, people didn't want to eat the foods as much at an outdoor picnic.
Hello, Santa Claus.
We need independent corroboration.
The change was silent, imperceptible, unless you knew exactly what to look for.
Paper maps are becoming obsolete.
I could build for you a structure up here in 3D, millimeter accurate, that only you could see, or my friends at home.
Imagine what we could do with a world full of GPS dots.
I was in my office some months back and got a telephone call.
"He didn't see anything obvious, and he said he'd have to take the car apart piece by piece."
In fact, as I looked into her case, I discovered to my surprise that it's not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else's car.
So you might be thinking, the Wave Bubble sounds great.
All of a sudden your GPS readout goes blank, and now it's just you and the fog and whatever you can pull off the radar system if you remember how to work it.
The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple.
So is this really possible?
We knew it wasn't going to be so hard, and we wanted to be the first to build one so we could get out in front of the problem and help protect against GPS spoofing.
They'd say, "Here you are. Here you are."
It's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of GPS dots.
Maybe you'll have a whole bag full of them.
We call ourselves Pors and Rao, and we live and work in India.
It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person.
And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.
So when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.
Of course, it got much better after that.
Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.
But as soon as they passed by, it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.
And it very slowly, over a few minutes, sort of painfully goes up, and then it gains momentum and it looks like it's almost about to fall.
So this is a work that we were very intrigued with, working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.
But we use it because we're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create.
Okay, I'm reading that at about 75 to 25 in favor at the start.
And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power, as are most climatologists who are engaging this issue seriously.
Electricity for cities, at its best, is what's called baseload electricity.
The nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don't have underground storage yet.
They've run out of good sites.
A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay, a physicist in England, and in his wonderful book, "Sustainable Energy," among other things, he says, "I'm not trying to be pro-nuclear. I'm just pro-arithmetic."
Typically, these things are put in the ground.
So arguing against, a man who's been at the nitty, gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years.
And if you look, wind and concentrated solar have the lowest CO2 emissions, if you look at the graph.
And in China, right now, they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear.
Let's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States to battery electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or flex fuel vehicles run on E85.
And Venezuela would be doing it if they started with their nuclear energy facilities.
The spacing is something else.
For example, cellulosic ethanol, to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet, this is how much land you would need.
Matching the reliability, base load is actually irrelevant.
If you use wind, you guarantee ice will last.
SB: I think a point of difference we're having, Mark, has to do with weapons and energy.
Mark, 30 seconds, either on that or on anything Stewart said.
We need someone for.
So if we get that through, then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris.
Tell me they're not going to have accidents.
And I'm, you know, very much "pro" that kind of stuff.
If we're going to keep the lights on, nuclear is that solution.
Because five years from now, it will blow you away what we'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible, disastrous nuclear power.
And as usual, they had to buy nuclear power from France.
Now, with regard to the resources, we've developed the first wind map of the world, from data alone, at 80 meters.
So, people of the TED community, I put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy.
You both won. I congratulate both of you.
It went like this.
It became part of us, and we believed in it.
This one went as follows: All societies, regardless of culture, be it Christian, Muslim, Confucian, must progress from traditional societies in which groups are the basic units to modern societies in which atomized individuals are the sovereign units, and all these individuals are, by definition, rational, and they all want one thing: the vote.
Eric X. Li: Now -- This story also became a bestseller.
Six hundred fifty million people were lifted out of poverty.
Middle class is expanding in speed and scale unprecedented in human history.
Now, most political scientists will tell us that a one-party system is inherently incapable of self-correction.
So the Party instituted term limits with mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70.
Indeed, corruption is a big problem, but let's first look at the larger context.
The question then is, how could that be possible in a system run by one party?
The range of positions is wide, from running health care in a village to foreign investment in a city district to manager in a company.
Just to show you how competitive the system is, in 2012, there were 900,000 fuke and ke levels, 600,000 fuchu and chu levels, and only 40,000 fuju and ju levels.
Now, please don't get me wrong, okay?
Where is the source of legitimacy?"
Financial Times polls global youth attitudes, and these numbers, brand new, just came from last week.
Now, I don't want to create the misimpression that China's hunky-dory, on the way to some kind of superpowerdom.
Transparency International ranks China between 70 and 80 in recent years among 170 countries, and it's been moving up.
Income per capita will be near the top of all developing countries.
It is the universal claim that many Western elites are making about their political system, the hubris, that is at the heart of the West's current ills.
And worst of all, it is boring.
EXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama, the political scientist, called the Chinese system "responsive authoritarianism."
So there is, in China, there is a different kind of mechanism to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people.
But it's different. You wouldn't recognize it.
In fact, the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources.
In fact, I think in the next decade, without any question, we will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous under the soils and different parts of that planet.
This was -- my motivation was actually during Apollo.
This is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying, "If I can go to the moon" -- this is the last human on the moon so far -- "nothing, nothing is impossible." But of course, we've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.
The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals, and clearly the industrial-military complex -- with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA -- are the dinosaurs.
For the first time ever, we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration.
100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that -- we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way, I'll grant you that.
12 to 15 launches per year.
Pilot: Release our fire.
And what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry and buying a hole-in-one insurance policy.
Today, you can go and experience weightless flights.
If we can get the audio up?
And this is something that we're very excited about.
You get publicity increase, and when it's won, publicity shoots through the roof -- if it's properly managed -- and that's part of the benefits to a sponsor.
Then, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridicule of -- that's a crazy idea, it'll never work.
We are looking at a number of energy prizes.
Within two minutes, three people pass two-year-old Wang Yue by.
And I believe you. I'm sure you're right.
What is really important is, can we reduce that death toll? Can we save some of those 19,000 children dying every day?
But it's really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effective and well-directed, and not only that, but also I think reason helps us to understand that other people, wherever they are, are like us, that they can suffer as we can, that parents grieve for the deaths of their children, as we do, and that just as our lives and our well-being matter to us, it matters just as much to all of these people.
According to one estimate, the Gates Foundation has already saved 5.8 million lives and many millions more, people, getting diseases that would have made them very sick, even if eventually they survived.
So Toby founded an organization called Giving What We Can to spread this information, to unite people who want to share some of their income, and to ask people to pledge to give 10 percent of what they earn over their lifetime to fighting global poverty.
But you might be surprised to know that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider, if they have the right abilities and character, is to go into banking or finance.
And the organization draws together people of different generations, like Holly Morgan, who's an undergraduate, who's pledged to give 10 percent of the little amount that she has, and on the right, Ada Wan, who has worked directly for the poor, but has now gone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give.
So you do the sums, and you get something like that.
And some effective altruists think it's very important to make sure that our species survives at all.
It's been something fulfilling to me.
You never get off, and you never really feel satisfied.
There's about 100 people each year in the U.S.
What kind of forms could we design if we wouldn't work with references anymore?
And I'm not saying that we should copy nature, I'm not saying we should mimic biology, instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes.
And in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything.
We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions.
I designed the process that generated the form.
So now I'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it, but instead I'm establishing a rule, I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded.
A challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column.
An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months, or it would take even a year to draw all the sections, all of the elevations, you can only create something like this through an algorithm.
And to go back to the analogy with nature, one can begin to think in terms of populations, one can talk about permutations, about generations, about crossing and breeding to come up with a design.
Unbeknownst to me at the time, because we had only seen the outside, the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves, to grow on the inside of the column, which was quite a surprising discovery.
But it is increasingly possible.
In short, we have no constraints.
If you follow that curve, you'll see that it starts way down there.
So we have this huge challenge, this huge gap.
Well, what is it to make a therapeutic, anyway?
So we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would, and say, "How can we do better?"
Here it is. That's the same kid.
I want to tell you about another disorder.
In an experiment done in cell culture and shown here in a cartoon, if you take that particular compound and you add it to that cell that has progeria, and you watch to see what happened, in just 72 hours, that cell becomes, for all purposes that we can determine, almost like a normal cell.
I cannot play sports or do physical activities, but I have been able to take interest in things that progeria, luckily, does not limit.
You might have noticed that the drug that is now in clinical trial for progeria is not a drug that was designed for that.
And you could expect quite a lot to come from this.
Let me tell you another thing we could do.
You can see this chip even breathes.
We have made all these discoveries pouring out of laboratories across the world.
I think it'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets and the surfers and the bankers and all the other people who join this stage and think about what we're trying to do here and why it matters.
Instead, it's a diverse cultural statement that we choose to wear.
And yes, Qatar wants to be a modern nation.
Life necessitates a universal world, however, we believe in the security of having a local identity.
How does that impact our desert culture?
I think that women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally.
They make a lot of money.
In the same way, Qatar is trying to grow its national museums through an organic process from within.
Now this museum is just as important to us as the West.
Last year we didn't have one Qatari woman filmmaker.
Boy: No, you play mom and I play dad.
It's important for two things.
Now I don't pretend to have all the answers, but I know that me as an individual and we as a nation welcome this community of ideas worth spreading.
And we use the word "nothing."
I thought, I need to retreat into something else.
I told her I couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me, ridiculing me, and using me as an example of failure.
And I thought, "These ants, are they looking for the queen ant?
That was a bit crude, at the time. And I made all these little apartments and little merry-go-rounds, seesaws and swings, little ladders.
So I realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us that's huge.
And he says to me "Willard, can you put my house on a pinhead?"
And the actual roof is made up of a fiber, which I found in my sister's old teddy bear.
So what I did, like I said, come back to the glass.
And how I constructed it, is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead.
So I found some more. And I decided to, sort of, construct it very, very slowly, holding my breath, working between my heartbeat, and making sure everything is leveled.
I noticed that the house was occupied.
I think he was just warning him actually.
And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air.
And after I've actually sculpted them, I have to paint them.
And I looked at it underneath the microscope.
My work, rough estimate, sometimes five, six to seven weeks; you can't always anticipate.
So say if you cut a period stop in half, a full stop, that's about the size of the whole thing.
And then I went ...
When I did this one, a gentleman seen it and said to me, "There's no way you can do this, you must have used some kind of machine.
The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand, because I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect.
Because we know we see needles, but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it.
So the eyes are probably about one micron or something.
It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.
The truth of the matter is otherwise.
The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism, or "tasawwuf" in Arabic.
The voice says, "Go away."
And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean.
All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way, get our egotism out of the way.
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other, because the knowledge of truth is within every human being.
Rumi has another story about three men, a Turk, an Arab and -- and I forget the third person, but for my sake, it could be a Malay.
Why? Because the soul, the human soul, embodies a piece of the divine breath, a piece of the divine soul.
Thank you, and God bless you.
And one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac hidden away a few streets away.
I traveled around the world, entered different cultures, wrote a series of books about my travels, including "Walking the Bible."
I have cancer.
Anyway -- so they had just turned three, and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground, laughing with all the glee in the world.
They may not have their dad.
She's got big hair -- although, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair, because if I say she has big hair, people will think she's from Texas.
And she loved the idea, but she quickly started rejecting my nominees.
We kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing.
And Jeff came up beside me and said, "So, have you ever been cow tipping?"
I was like, "Yes?"
What would you tell them?"
Twenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped, and there was a 15 percent survival rate.
This is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived it before me.
And one night I got a call from my mother-in-law that my daughters, at that time three and a half, were missing me and feeling my absence.
And what was so striking about that time was, instead of repulsing people, I was actually proving to be a magnet for people.
And this also happened to my girls as they began to see, and, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate.
And yet from everything we've been talking about -- compliance, or addiction, or weight loss -- we now know that community is important, and yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in.
But like a lot of modern men, he hugs, he bakes, he leaves work early to coach Little League.
He said, "I don't see the wall," and I'm telling you the same, Don't see the wall.
Walking upright, we are told, is the threshold of what made us human.
He was called a "flaneur," one who wanders the arcades.
That 50th year is called the jubilee year, and it's the origin of that term.
I wrote a letter to my girls that appears at the end of my book, "The Council of Dads," and I listed these lessons, a few of which you've heard here today: Approach the cow, pack your flipflops, don't see the wall, live the questions, harvest miracles.
I got good news that day, and I stand here today cancer-free, walking without aid and hobbling forward.
Thank you very much.
And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe, you know, in his brain something was stirring, some sort of musical gift.
And now, here's what Nanny did also do was to press the record button on one of those little early tape recorders that they had, and this is a wonderful tape, now, of Derek playing when you were four years old.
Now, along -- Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old, and at first, Derek, I thought you were mad, to be honest, because when you played the piano, you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard, and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way.
Basically it was just an exciting journey, really.
But Derek, your ear is so much more than that.
Etc.
Can you play "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note?
The other wonderful thing about you is memory.
AO: Well done.
AO: I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it.
DP: For one encore. AO: One encore, yes.
Now, I'm sure you recognize this object; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days.
And on top of it, the juicy salif.
This is affordable and can come home with you and, as such, it can sit on your kitchen counter -- it can't go in your drawers; trust me, I found that out the hard way -- and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design.
No, I have an iPhone. Of course I do.
It is easy to forget the gasp-inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life.
And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people, these amazing talks that we've had.
We want to know about health care.
And I propose to bring into this TED conference, as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom.
And we're using -- you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff -- but we're using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area.
She does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them, but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn't like making mistakes.
And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves -- modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose -- the beginning of tool-making.
It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human.
They have very sophisticated cooperation.
So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees -- who've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility -- are in the wild, disappearing very fast.
And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called, than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred.
Didn't they know what was happening?
In the developed world, in a way, it's worse, because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we're doing.
I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because, finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now, I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world.
And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren, and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age.
And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference.
It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural.
We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden.
And then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel, saying, "Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it."
Hard work and persistence --don't give up -- and love and compassion leading to respect for all life.
And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place.
We can see a whole area desolated, and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help.
So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?
So we go from, say, this beautiful and complex crystal as non-life, and this rather beautiful and complex cat on the other side.
Now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment.
And so what we do is, we start simple and we work our way up to living systems.
And in this particular example, what I took is some membrane molecules, mixed those together in the right environment, and within seconds it forms these rather complex and beautiful structures here.
This is natural from the environment, this clay.
So, something is missing.
It is moving around, exploring its environment, and remodeling its environment, as you see, by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.
If we count the number of chemicals in that system, actually, including the water that's in the dish, we have five chemicals that can do this.
And we just put these two together in the same system.
Now we have a dancing protocell and a self-replication event. Right.
You turn up the heat, you start making or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar, forming a brownish caramel, right?
They become very energetic, and able to find the resource in the environment, similar to what we saw before.
Well, they came up with three very general criteria. First is -- and they're listed here.
But these protocells satisfy these general requirements of living systems.
Because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error.
And I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices that I set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face.
And the interesting thing that happens -- because we're using tadpoles, of course, because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have, several orders of magnitude more sensitive than some of our senses for sensing, responding in a biologically meaningful way, to that whole class of industrial contaminants we call endocrine disruptors or hormone emulators.
Anyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse -- a domestic partnership with mice?
Coping with environmental stressors is tricky.
Where's our export?
It's very different from the medical model.
These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants before they enter the harbor, and they're produced by impatients on various city blocks in some very interesting ways.
This is one of the more ambitious ones.
What it does is a very simple idea of taking -- 80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan is building related -- we take, just like a commercial greenhouse, we take the CO2 from the building -- CO2-enriched air -- we force it through the urban agriculture facility, and then we resupply oxygen-enriched air.
You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building, it'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow.
Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users.
This is communication technology for birds. I looks like this.
The birds were able to jump from one to the other.
That is, share your lunch.
And then you can also text the fish.
Instead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish.
But I wanted to say that interaction, re-scripting that interaction, into collective action, collective remediative action, very different from the approach that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River, where we're dredging the PCBs -- after 30 years of legislative and legal struggle, GE's paying for the dredging of the largest Superfund site in the world -- we're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania or the nearest Third World country, where it will continue to be toxic sludge.
Prince wrote a great song: "Little Red Corvette."
We really have to ask the question: Can the world sustain that number of automobiles?
And we wanted to take advantage of Moore's Law with electronic controls and software, and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected.
And secondly, when are these kinds of cars going to be available?
That hydrogen's being made because there's a good business reason for its use.
We think it's a question of not whether, but a question of when.
that's a huge power-generating capability, a mobile power-generating capability.
And I tell them I sleep like a baby: I wake up crying every two hours.
Larry Burns: Yeah, we're absolutely serious.
So I grew up in East Los Angeles, not even realizing I was poor.
Really, do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list?
And eventually, I ended up at a school where there was a mixture.
But then, they were very surprised when I graduated from high school.
I had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before.
And we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding, for support.
But what if we get it right?
And because we connect it to what they're doing — For example, they made public service announcements for the Cancer Society.
Because it's time that kids like me stop being the exception, and we become the norm.
It was about 35 families that lived on this farm, and everything that we produced on this farm, we consumed.
I met an incredible girl who became my lifelong best friend, and my associate in everything that I have done till now, my wife, Lélia Wanick Salgado.
I put photography as my life.
I started to have infection everywhere.
It was a big coincidence.
This farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds, and we didn't know how to deal with these.
It became a national park.
We created an incredible amount of pictures, and the result -- Lélia did the design of all my books, the design of all my shows. She is the creator of the shows.
But there is another part that we must together rebuild, to build our societies, our modern family of societies, we are at a point where we cannot go back.
And we must rebuild these forests.
You happy people that have a lot of hair on your head, if you take a shower, it takes you two or three hours to dry your hair if you don't use a dryer machine.
Land completely destroyed, the erosion there, the land had dried.
We are doing the sequestration of about 100,000 tons of carbon with these trees.
Cities, past and future.
And from these early experiences as a child I learned to love landscapes.
I'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown Manhattan.
And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill, and I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree.
Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway.
This is Richmond Hill, and Minetta Water, which used to run its way through Greenwich Village.
But I had another idea about this map.
And we built a probability map about where they might have been.
And it turns out that Manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types.
Where do they get their reproductive resources?
But a beaver also needs things. And that having it on either side means that we can link it together, that we can create the network of the habitat relationships for these species.
And that you can put these on a grid that's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way.
So then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps.
We used the tools they use in Hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies.
This is the view from the East River, looking up Murray Hill at where the United Nations is today.
There is such power in bringing science and visualization together, that we can create images like this, perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass.
This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity.
This is a crowd that does know what it is, so I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right?
It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable.
North Americans, such as myself, you know, we're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs, and we're eating all sorts of stuff.
And those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did, no matter where they live.
And I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable.
Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out.
Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there, you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city.
Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments.
When you share them, you end up using less.
This is a bio-morphic building.
So this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae.
They don't have existing infrastructure; they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty, and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out how to do things in new ways.
So I rather like this picture here.
This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo.
It's doing something new. There's new things happening.
And as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week, are absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions, is we've got to craft new political realities.
OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that.
We get so little news about the developing world that we often forget that there are literally millions of people out there struggling to change things to be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt.
You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains.
Here's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area, will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable.
Seriously -- give that one a hand, it's pretty great.
Does anyone know what this is?
And I think that we will.
This is a hand-lettered sign that appeared in a mom and pop bakery in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.
If you want a printed sugar birthday cake, you have to use one of our prefab images -- only for professionals."
They want to take them out of the domain name system.
If you were making a TV show, it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made; it only had to be better than the two other shows that were on at the same time -- which is a very low threshold of competitive difficulty.
And this freaked the media businesses out -- it freaked them out every time.
If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them, that's not okay.
It was a complicated piece of legislation, a lot of moving parts.
Now the DMCA had, and is continuing to have, a lot of complicated effects, but in this one domain, limiting sharing, it has mostly not worked.
But where the DMCA was surgical -- we want to go down into your computer, we want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine, and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store -- PIPA and SOPA are nuclear and they're saying, we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content.
So this is the Internet they have in mind.
You don't have millions and millions of dollars, but you can call your representatives, and you can remind them that you vote, and you can ask not to be treated like a thief, and you can suggest that you would prefer that the Internet not be broken.
And all of this goes back to the failure of the DMCA to disallow sharing as a technical means.
And if we defeat these, as I hope we do, more is coming.
Apparently, I was in charge of making sure that no one stole the computers from the university.
Now medical devices have come a long way technologically.
Well, in order to not have to open up the person every time you want to reprogram their device or do some diagnostics on it, they made the thing be able to communicate wirelessly, and what this research team did is they reverse engineered the wireless protocol, and they built the device you see pictured here, with a little antenna, that could talk the protocol to the device, and thus control it.
Okay, let me shift gears and show you another target.
They basically stuck an attacker on the wired network and on the wireless network.
Okay, so think of that as, someone gets to go to your car, they get to mess around with it, and then they leave, and now, what kind of trouble are you in?
One of the things they were able to do from the chase car is apply the brakes on the other car, simply by hacking the computer.
You use the GPS in the car to locate it.
What you see here in number one is a reflection in somebody's glasses of the smartphone that they're typing in.
Could you run a denial-of-service, because these are first responders?
So they bought a scanner. These are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the P25, and what they did is they hopped around frequencies and they wrote software to listen in.
Now, we've all looked at smartphones upside down.
They typed in, "The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled that Rahm Emanuel is eligible to run for Mayor of Chicago" — see, I tied it in to the last talk — "and ordered him to stay on the ballot."
If someone is able to put malware on your iPhone, they could then maybe get the typing that you do whenever you put your iPhone next to your keyboard.
And I'd like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor, living on less than one dollar a day.
It changed my life.
"What do you want to do in a village?
I went to this village for the first time.
Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us?"
You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community.
And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal.
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas.
This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground."
He had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it. No way.
It is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don't know.
But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest, a Hindu priest, who's only done eight years of primary schooling -- never been to school, never been to college.
We have a dentist -- she's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist.
Because it's for the convenience of the child; it's not for the convenience of the teacher.
She has a cabinet, a minister of education, a minister for energy, a minister for health.
Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high, we use puppetry.
The attendance must not drop."
Why? Because they want to leave the village and go to a city, looking for a job.
I said, "I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well."
They go back and solar-electrify their own village.
All these women sitting at one table from eight, nine countries, all chatting to each other, not understanding a word, because they're all speaking a different language.
He said, "No." Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.
I knew which woman I would like to take.
"What happens if she runs off with an Indian man?"
I'll just wind up by saying that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside.
Thank you.
But first a little bit about this group of artists, scientists, and engineers that are working together.
Our narrative here is real fMRI data that's mapped visually and sonically.
For artists, we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore.
You see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists.
You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines.
This will be the final project that I show you.
When you have 21 minutes to speak, two million years seems like a really long time.
Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life.
One of them is winning the lottery. This is about 314 million dollars.
Now, don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz, because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time.
I am more invulnerable than Achilles; fortune hath not one place to hit me."
As a challenge to myself, since I say this once in a while in lectures, I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness.
What does he have to say all these years later about it?
"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience."
And then finally -- you know, the best of all possible worlds -- some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best, who was the original drummer for the Beatles, until they, you know, sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour.
"Oh yeah, right. You really didn't have that much in common with her, and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face."
Now, I'm a scientist, so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric, but by marinating you in a little bit of data.
We happen to have number three and number four," we tell the subject. This is a bit of a difficult choice, because neither one is preferred strongly to the other, but naturally, people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four.
That's the synthesis of happiness.
Like everybody else, they said, "Gee, thanks Doc! That's great! I could use a new print.
"No problem, Jim. All I want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one you like the least."
These people like better the one they own, but they don't know they own it.
And I'm going to show you why.
"Ah! Now that you mention it, it does seem a little silkier!"
Now what I want to show you is that people don't know this about themselves, and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage.
You get to keep one, and I get to keep one."
And look at what we find.
They don't like their picture, and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired, they still don't like their picture. Why?
It's nice poetry, but that can't exactly be right.
But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures, we are at risk.
Baking soda and vinegar.
They use solid propellant most frequently.
To take this shot, I do what I often do, which is go way beyond the pads where none of the other spectators are.
Up, up, up.
It is this breathtaking image -- success, of course -- that motivates us and motivates kids to follow and understand rocket science: to understand the importance of physics and math and, in many ways, to sort of have that awe at exploration of the frontiers of the unknown.
"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?"
"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?"
"I already heard your mother. I think she's right."
Back then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.
I'm telling you this one.
I called my mom.
I got an errand to run."
But now she was a septuagenarian, she'd stopped driving.
I show up. She's in the carport.
Oh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license.
I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny.
Puts it in reverse. Fifty-five out of the driveway, in reverse.
I said, "Ma, pick a lane!"
"Four or five days."
So I look up and I'm thinking, maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute."
Now, I don't know if she's toying with me, kind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse -- left paw, right paw, left paw, right paw -- but by now, we've reached the mall.
It's Saturday. It's the holidays."
"No, no, no. The only thing with him is, he's an idiot.
You want to laugh, but you don't know -- you're that politically corrected, have you noticed?
And years of therapy later, we're doing great.
"I'm coming." Italian hand signals follow.
She wields great power.
I grew up with this woman.
Ready? Brace yourselves. Here it comes.
Come on, honey, tell it to me."
I pull in. I put the car in park.
People are watching us all around," right?
I'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder.
I said, "No, I follow little old women around parking lots to see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!"
Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw.
And I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that.
What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve, by the hour and by the day, instead of using their own car.
Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world that I can have at my beck and call, but heaven forbid I would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it.
It's because they said, "It's eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day.
This will apply to people across all of America.
Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel.
And again, do people like the outcome?
And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient, that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes, so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive.
Because I'm going to say, that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight.
These are also called mesh networks.
Volunteers flew in, added a whole bunch of devices, and for the next 12 months, mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans.
There isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen -- or in those municipalities, to build out their cities with these wireless networks -- because there's zero ongoing communications cost.
We could have a coast-to-coast, free wireless communication system.
Right now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices -- I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane -- that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks.
And if I had my druthers, we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards.
So the Awesome story: It begins about 40 years ago, when my mom and my dad came to Canada.
We grew up, and we grew older.
Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.
My marriage wasn't going well, and we just were growing further and further apart.
Very sadly, he took his own life.
And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits, and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions.
But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.
None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.
I love hanging out with three year-olds.
That three-year-old girl is still part of you.
He's number 76 in the picture.
I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL, he started joining clubs.
And you end you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled.
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.
And when my dad tells the story, he says, "The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.
And I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am.
When I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right.
We've got books, buffets and radio waves, wedding brides and rollercoaster rides.
You will never be as young as you are right now.
There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero.
J So many, in fact, that seeing has become a bit of a problem.
Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.
DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th, I felt myself in the role originally -- first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated, and as someone who works less than a mile from there -- that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating.
And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios, but to help right now.
It was just extraordinary.
And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.
The city actually approached us.
There was no filter.
And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site.
DR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this -- we had to work with the families of the victims, through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening.
And Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country, volunteered to do it at cost.
And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site.
So we didn't know what to do, but we decided to cast a very wide net.
It seems to me with this, that it was the opposite of that.
But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible.
I think this is, obviously, substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it.
And that's what we were interested in.
DR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas, where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses.
I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces, regardless of what the number is.
This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help.
As you say, it's not a memorial.
I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done.
It's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else; it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are."
And, despite being cursed with my athletic inability, he plays soccer.
Let's take a look.
Close.
It requires only a change in consciousness, and that can be any one of a number of symptoms, including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy, hearing a ringing in your ear, being more impulsive or hostile than usual.
And here's the really alarming part: we don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries.
So how do we guarantee the safety of our kids?
The first: study up.
It's a great place to start if you have questions.
Maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear -- which brings us to suit up.
So whether athlete, scholar, over-protected kid, neurotic mom, or otherwise, here's my baby, Vander, reminding you to mind your matter.
In the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool -- as in Yankee Doodle.
And unfortunately, the press tends to reinforce this norm when they're reporting on a doodling scene -- of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like -- they typically use words like "discovered" or "caught" or "found out," as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed.
And I'm not comfortable with that.
Additionally, it has a profound effect on creative problem-solving and deep information processing.
And I think that is incredible.
In reality, it is one of its greatest allies.
The U.S. government decided to take action, and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of airplanes.
In 2002, they were facing a different battle.
Thirty-four million are infected with HIV.
First of all, the rules have changed.
There's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away.
That can be generic manufacturers.
It relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others to use.
The pool is already working today, two months later, with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed. This is unprecedented.
We are in this wonderful open-air amphitheater and we are enjoying ourselves in that mild evening temperature tonight, but when Qatar will host the football World Cup 10 years from now, 2022, we already heard it will be in the hot, very hot and sunny summer months of June and July.
Mexico temperature has been, air temperature has been something between 15, up to 30 degrees C, and people enjoyed themselves.
It's again, sun in the day and high humidity, and it was not comfortable.
That's it. And if I don't get rid of the energy, I will die.
And how does it look like in a stadium?
But even the best passive design wouldn't help.
And I can do that in the first year and I can balance that in the next 10, and the next 20 years, this energy, which is necessary to condition a World Cup in Qatar, the next 20 years, this energy goes into the grid of Qatar.
And I also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters, it will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions, to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an outdoor environment, and we can do that with the best passive design, but also using the energy source of the site in Qatar which is the sun.
So this man, his name is Sathi Shri.
And it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there, and he was like, "Yeah, do you want an upgrade?"
It's even happening in Africa, like, for example, in Cape Town we did extensive research on this.
There's the traditional crafts, and then there's the technology crafts.
It also affords us cheap fabrication, which is fantastic, so it means that you can do a lot more with it.
So there is this amazing concept called the one-teacher school, which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker who teaches this amazing little social setting.
So the thing that we got was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector that comes for about 60 dollars.
Out comes this, a little lunch box -- form factor.
But it's not limited to just education.
So we said, "Come on, there's got to be a better way of doing this for sure."
Come along.
So it's taking a little reading from you.
Thank you for the good news. VV: Yeah.
A TED medley -- a TEDley.
And in this case, unlike this couple, she was being cared for by her daughter.
And then, in fact, these people were embedded in other sorts of relationships: marriage and spousal and friendship and other sorts of ties.
It had become trendy to speak about the "obesity epidemic."
In addition, some questions are immediately raised: How much clustering is there?
And then the next line over says if your friend's friend's friend, someone you probably don't even know, is obese, your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher.
And we found that if your friend becomes obese, it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent in the same given time period.
And we thought this was a very interesting comment on America, and a kind of self-serving, "not my responsibility" kind of phenomenon.
Every tie between them is a relationship.
And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena.
There's emotional contagion that takes place in human populations.
Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger, as in riots.
There's a middle and an edge to this network, and the unhappy people seem to be located at the edges.
And notice first of all -- so, to understand this, though, we need to dissect network structure a little bit first -- and notice that every person in this network has exactly the same structural location as every other person.
Now, those people both have four friends, but A's friends all know each other, and B's friends do not.
Would you rather be C or D?
Whether your friends know each other has not just to do with their genes, but with yours.
They are a kind of social capital.
Our experience of the world depends on the actual structure of the networks in which we're residing and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow through the network.
So the spread of good and valuable things is required to sustain and nourish social networks.
Sometimes I'm concerned that we hear about it so much that we've come to accept longer lives with a kind of a complacency, even ease.
Because what that means is that for the first time in the history of the species, the majority of babies born in the Developed World are having the opportunity to grow old.
That's right, older people are happy.
So we've asked all sorts of questions to see if we could undo this finding.
And every time we paged them we'd ask them to answer several questions -- On a one to seven scale, how happy are you right now?
And other research has shown that older people seem to engage with sadness more comfortably.
But as social scientists, we continue to ask about possible alternatives.
And if there's a paradox of aging, it's that recognizing that we won't live forever changes our perspective on life in positive ways.
We take less notice of trivial matters.
If we invest in science and technology and find solutions for the real problems that older people face and we capitalize on the very real strengths of older people, then added years of life can dramatically improve quality of life at all ages.
I mean, this is literally human beings with super-human strength and abilities.
And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared, sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos.
And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages, with cheap webcams, lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow.
Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it, but sometimes they get a little freaked out.
I got my name just because I was so young.
I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota.
They've called me "brother" and "uncle" and invited me again and again over five years.
The following is a time-line of treaties made, treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles.
1866: the beginning of the transcontinental railroad -- a new era.
The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux.
We had plans.
A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as "sell or starve:" Sign the paper, or no food for your tribe.
The move destroyed the reservations, making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation.
The Wounded Knee massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars.
They were tired of sacred hills.
The court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken and that the initial offering price plus interest should be paid to the Sioux Nation.
More than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line.
The last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say, "My God, what are these people doing to themselves?
As removed as we the dominant society may feel from a massacre in 1890, or a series of broken treaties 150 years ago, I still have to ask you the question, how should you feel about the statistics of today?
It's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti, or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine.
As a researcher, every once in a while you encounter something a little disconcerting.
For babies, it's deadly.
Many of you have probably used this.
Well the easy answer is, we just haven't gotten those salts to those people.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well, the last mile's proving incredibly stubborn.
On Medicaid -- if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid, or if you have health insurance -- insulin is pretty straightforward.
We think there's an income problem, so we create new ways of farming that increase income.
This machine is really strange, and one of the consequences is that people are weird.
Let me go back to diarrhea for a second.
In India, 35 to 50 percent say "Reduce."
Just doesn't make sense.
I'm going to give you a little math problem, and I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible.
Yeah. So, together they would cost $1.20.
It's called "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?"
Ready? Go.
I found a problem, a specific problem that actually found an error with that.
And they are trying to figure out, "Safety is good.
They are saying, "This is 35 miles per gallon. I'm going to do the environmentally right thing, I'm going to buy the Prius, 50 miles per gallon."
Why? Because we don't care about miles per gallon, we care about gallons per mile.
They showed a BMW driving down the street.
This is a battle we all fight every day, along with trying to get to the gym.
This is a typical insulin injection.
You just gotta carry this thing around.
This is about energy efficiency.
And I think to tackle it, we need to combine psychology, marketing, art, we've seen that.
We put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies.
So, this whole area is so fascinating.
That's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign.
Alright Sendhil, thanks so much for coming to TED. Thank you.
And they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these.
So what does that mean?
It's like a wall to the electricity.
And we can start talking about things like electrical load.
And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.
They were combined in the media.
These are 65,000 coat hangers in a street that's lined with fashion stores.
We had a show that just came down last week in New York.
This is our roof in New York, the roof of the studio.
But I will demonstrate different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point, to find an answer probably much quicker than Arthur did. So, first, we violate the common sense, the logic. All of you, if you hold your hand like this, 90 degrees -- all of you. Not you.
Right-molded you say, with iron?
But it was six moves. Now with one move.
Good. Nice. And you can sit over there.
memory system, right?
And here, I had a mat here to make it a little -- the critical moment is -- sorry.
But also the other hand is good, if all the other guys have good hands too.
Such life. Right?
Right? You agree.
LG: Here -- you see some are missing?
Come to -- no, no, no, no.
Not at the last card.
So, this deck is bought here. Sorry.
But not too much.
But you know, I think you are familiar with fractals -- the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Yes, right.
Now, I do it quicker, better.
LG: Diamonds, good. I start here.
But now I do it the regular speed, right?
And you'll say stop, anywhere. Got it?
And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.
and queen of hearts. Yes!
When I put one card at a table -- look, it's not one card. It's -- look, it's a bunch of cards that gives this impression.
Now, I put the laser here, and -- now, when I deal the cards in the laser, I know where they are but -- yes?
Ah, good, good, good. But now.
So here, here I have to peek, lots of cards.
You see, I don't work with prestige, so always do mistakes.
So I find ...
I like this guy, yeah.
Ah, this is tough.
So here, diamonds, hearts -- no, diamonds. Good, good.
It's too easy to do it right away, right?
But it was -- did you hear?
And it was OK. One more?
Maybe I'll stand up. Half.
Two -- and it was two of spades, right?
Try that.
LG: It's not here? Zoe: It's not there.
Seven.
Ten -- once again, I love this Jonny Wayne move.
One, two, three, four -- mmm!
And one of them wrote, "Situation hopeless. Stop.
One is I want to remind you of what a seven-year-old child sounds like when he plays the piano.
Now, what happened was not maybe what you thought, which is, he suddenly became passionate, engaged, involved, got a new teacher, he hit puberty, or whatever it is.
I didn't say, "I'm going to move my shoulder over, move my body."
There was a gasp in the audience when they heard the difference.
And your children are playing instruments.
These are the people who never listen to classical music.
If you were tone-deaf, you couldn't change the gears on your car, in a stick shift car.
So that's what we're going to do.
"I don't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year."
We have a B. This is a B. The next note is a C.
Now, Chopin didn't want to reach the E there, because what will have happened? It will be over, like Hamlet.
So he does it again.
And then finally ...
And what you're going to see is one-buttock playing.
A beloved grandmother, a lover -- somebody in your life who you love with all your heart, but that person is no longer with you.
Think of it. 1,600 people, busy people, involved in all sorts of different things, listening, understanding and being moved by a piece by Chopin.
So I made up my mind at that moment that classical music is for everybody. Everybody.
Now, I had an amazing experience. I was 45 years old, I'd been conducting for 20 years, and I suddenly had a realization.
If their eyes are shining, you know you're doing it.
And I say, it's appropriate for us to ask the question, who are we being as we go back out into the world?
Unfortunately, it was the last thing she ever said to him, because she never saw him again. He did not survive.
Now, in America law is a professional degree: you get your university degree, then you go on to law school.
I want to make a hard-headed, evidence-based, dare I say lawyerly case, for rethinking how we run our businesses.
Now many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall.
This shows the power of incentives.
Question: How much faster did this group solve the problem?
You've got an incentive designed to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity, and it does just the opposite.
If you look at the science, there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.
What happened this time?
That reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility.
Are the problems that you face, or even the problems we've been talking about here, are those kinds of problems -- do they have a clear set of rules, and a single solution? No.
This is not a philosophy.
What happened? As long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected: the higher the pay, the better the performance.
But this time, people offered the highest rewards, they did the worst of all.
Last month, just last month, economists at LSE looked at 51 studies of pay-for-performance plans, inside of companies.
And to my mind, that new operating system for our businesses revolves around three elements: autonomy, mastery and purpose.
Okay? Somebody invented it.
It looks like less than half.
Why? Because you have to deliver something overnight.
They show up when they want.
And I say, "Nope. I have proof."
If they went head to head, who would win?"
And here is what science knows.
This is a sculpture I made, which is a way of, kind of, freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom.
But if you put something on top of it, it disbalances it. And so it would tip over.
So this is just floating, floating on a permanent magnetic field, which stabilizes it in all directions.
And here is a similar sculpture.
And then each of these little spheres is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun.
It weighs about a ton or over a ton.
This is based on the structure of a diamond.
This is an idea of moving a sculpture, a ball, that would be directed around the room by a computer.
And some of it is just the idea of creating media -- media as a sculpture, something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever-changing, by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of.
I came with a plan.
The cabin is open or closed, as you like.
It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways.
It would also be able to be an open code, so people could interact with it.
They say, "Really? How many?"
And I do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward.
But it doesn't seem to be working.
We have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone would make very much money helping other people.
Now, there's no way you're going to get a lot of people with $400,000 talent to make a $316,000 sacrifice every year to become the CEO of a hunger charity.
I want it go to the needy."
That's an important fact, because it tells us that in 40 years, the nonprofit sector has not been able to wrestle any market share away from the for-profit sector.
If you can't raise more revenue, you can't grow.
If we have any doubts about the effects of this separate rule book, this statistic is sobering: From 1970 to 2009, the number of nonprofits that really grew, that crossed the $50 million annual revenue barrier, is 144.
They were taught that self-interest was a raging sea that was a sure path to eternal damnation.
Now this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question, which is, "What percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead?"
I'll give you two examples. We launched the AIDSRides with an initial investment of 50,000 dollars in risk capital.
They wanted to distance themselves from us because we were being crucified in the media for investing 40 percent of the gross in recruitment and customer service and the magic of the experience and there is no accounting terminology to describe that kind of investment in growth and in the future, other than this demonic label of overhead.
Now which pie would we prefer, and which pie do we think people who are hungry would prefer?
But it's never going to happen by forcing these organizations to lower their horizons to the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low.
Dan Pallotta: Thank you very much. Thank you.
Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.
And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.
Unlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.
And I often show this to senior management.
And then you have other stories, unseen.
Yeah, that was very short, but you could see it's a completely different figure. Right?
Now look at me. "Aaaaaah," and I stop you. Let's go.
Responsible in front of him.
So he had to resign. Isn't that nice?
So, the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself.
Let's see another super-conductor, a German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please.
Audience: Itay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained, let me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come.
And when Karajan is asked about it he actually says, "Yes, the worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction.
Oh yeah. He says, "You start when you can't stand it anymore."
When he does this, it's not, "Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix, smash it on the floor." It's not that.
It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.
But it's the best music making, like this.
See, second time for the same player.
The whole orchestra is playing.
So that's a good thing.
So Kleiber is about process.
And you're playing a painful sound.
And Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?
My work, for a long time, has been involved in education, in teaching people practical skills for sustainability, teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food, how to build buildings using local materials, how to generate their own energy, and so on.
We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials, medicine, modern clothing, laptops, a whole range of different things.
In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it.
No. But the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are.
And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels, and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy, or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.
And we have the elves in the form of China.
And it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks, the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis, that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints, the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side, the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world.
And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face, and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need.
Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here, what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.
When they encounter shock from the outside that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.
So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.
They are mulling whether they're going to take it further.
A lot of places are working with their local schools.
Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community, still start by assuming that there will be more energy, more cars, more housing, more jobs, more growth, and so on.
As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.
And for me, one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done, when Eleanor Roosevelt did it, it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.
This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning.
U.S. economy is big -- 14.7 trillion.
And some of that, in fact, is due to the fact that we've had an economic recession.
After all, at least on paper, there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced.
What were those things that allowed us to hide this?
Is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do?
So it's systemic across the entire country.
If you don't change that revenue picture, if you don't solve what you're doing in health care, you're going to be deinvesting in the young.
Technology has a role to play.
Where's the brain trust that's in error here?
And the numbers are used to make decisions.
We need to take the fact that the current employees, the future liabilities they create, that should come out of the current budget.
In fact, the week afterwards, some tax cuts were done that made the situation even worse than their assumptions.
Thank you.
Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug, one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard, and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy, which has become very popular in music therapy now.
Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession.
Nathaniel's story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States, as told through the book and the movie "The Soloist," but I became his friend, and I became his violin teacher, and I told him that wherever he had his violin, and wherever I had mine, I would play a lesson with him.
After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino, a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face, and she had a palsy, she was shaking, and she had this gorgeous smile, and she said that she had never heard classical music before, she didn't think she was going to like it, she had never heard a violin before, but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine, and that nobody ever came to visit them, and that for the first time in six years, when she heard us play, she stopped shaking without medication.
And Keats said, "Beauty is truth, and truth beauty.
Now, as you know, sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day.
This will warm up the scented oil inside, and a particular smell will be emitted.
Many years after the solar powered clocks project, a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses.
[Sound] [Touch] [Sight] [Smell] [Taste] JL: And that's how the five senses graph works.
Okay, here what I found interesting was that taste is at four, and many respondents told me it's because of the taste of drinks, but also, in some cases, kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience.
Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level.
And that's what this theory taught me about my field.
Finally, I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet.
Oh, one last thing before I leave.
There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.
We are all born artists.
Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.
"Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!"
In essence, they are not different.
He was not on good terms with his father.
But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand, making mountains and seas -- well, not seas, but different things -- people and dogs, etc.
When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment, many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.
"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."
You know this gentleman, right?
"I'm drawing diligently," I said.
There were a lot of girls there as well, so I was utterly mortified.
No crows are brought up.
Picasso even made the statement, "I draw not what I see but what I think."
In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing "She's Gone" or "Hotel California," miming the guitar riffs.
This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.
We get jealous, not because we're evil, but because we have little artists pent up inside us.
They can write the play, for example, and the writers may work on stage art.
It can be a simple theme: Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.
The really good writing I've seen in my class was not from the assignments with a long deadline, but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did in front of me with a pencil.
Sometimes they look like our spouses, but they are not your parents or spouses.
It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.
King Lear.
In 1990, she was asked this question.
And what would you do if you knew what I know?
I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus.
In 1981, we published an article in Science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 degrees Celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO2.
By 15 years later, evidence of global warming was much stronger.
After I informed the New York Times about these restrictions, NASA was forced to end the censorship.
So the key quantity is Earth's energy imbalance.
The total energy imbalance now is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter.
Yet, there was more energy coming in than going out.
When there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt.
There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning.
The important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity's control.
Fifty years ago, such anomalies covered only two- to three-tenths of one percent of the land area.
Now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple, honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100 percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis, with the government not keeping one dime.
But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society, our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 400 to 500 billion dollars per year worldwide, thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel -- mountaintop removal, longwall mining, fracking, tar sands, tar shale, deep ocean Arctic drilling.
If we wait 10 years, it is 15 percent per year -- extremely difficult and expensive, perhaps impossible.
Or perhaps not quite on Earth.
We can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set, or any passerby. So, safety is everything.
Yakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight.
Highly dangerous, but also you'll notice it doesn't look as though I'm wearing anything underneath the suit.
Having said that, it works with compressed nitrogen.
But we have padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane -- the materials that help us, when we're hit like this, not to hurt ourselves too much.
Rolling a car over is another area where we use technology.
"Well, we can flip the bus over, we can have it burst into flames, and how about someone, you know, big explosion."
We went to Cambridge University, the other university, and spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there, a physicist who taught us that it had to be 37 miles an hour.
That's the only reason we do it. See, it's all fun, this job.
It's 30 feet. It's water. It's very simple.
And again, technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters, and stop within a couple of feet of the ground without melting the rope with the friction, because of the alloys I used in the descender device.
And just how brave he was in 1960, bear in mind.
And I'm planning to go from 120,000 feet, which is about 22 miles.
He's in his 80s and he lives in Florida. He's a tremendous guy.
Not even a jet engine.
I'm excited and I'm scared, both at the same time in equal measures.
That's in New Mexico.
Well there's a little bit more to it than that.
It was made by a Russian that's designed most of the suits of the past 18 years for the Soviets.
Then they're comfortable, they have good vision, like this great big visor.
It's a working prototype. I will use it for all the jumps.
And I hope that you will agree with me, it is the greatest stunt on Earth.
If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly, if you work in education.
If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue -- despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days -- what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.
I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this little girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson she did.
It was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel.
And the third boy said, "Frank sent this."
And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this -- he said that all children are born artists.
Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he? How annoying would that be?
Anyway, he was really upset on the plane, and he said, "I'll never find another girl like Sarah."
Why not? I think this is rather important.
And I used to be one, so there.
And there you will see it -- grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat, waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it.
And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities designed the system in their image.
And I didn't want one, frankly.
The brain isn't divided into compartments.
I say, "Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here. Give me a break."
People weren't aware they could have that.
People who had to move to think." Who had to move to think.
And he's right.
Don't get me wrong: it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East.
Also, three guys working for years in Los Angeles, an Iranian, a Palestinian and an Egyptian, created the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act.
And I had every intention of taking this tribe from being outliers in the Middle East and pushing them over the tipping point towards success.
The earth rotated, as did our management, and as if by divine intervention, things came together to help this revolution take shape.
So I quickly went to work with a great team around me.
In five countries, in just under a month, we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live.
And all this TV and Internet exposure has led to a great many recruits to our cause.
And the Lebanese, brilliant Lebanese, Nemr Abou Nassar, we featured in our first tour, has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs.
We have a positive story to tell and image to sell.
For inspiration, go to one of our festivals, go online, drop us a line.
Today, some 25, 30 years later, we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85 percent.
Early detection, early intervention, that's the story for these successes.
It's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country.
What drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression?
Now, I started by telling you that there were some good-news stories.
That's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days, and people feel that, for whatever reason, it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior.
In a sense, it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition, something you can observe, that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex, mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand.
As we think about this, probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder, and that would be schizophrenia, because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters.
The tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier, long before the symptoms emerge.
But this tells us how we need to think about it, and where we need to go.
And then in 2003 I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation from my kitchen table.
Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary and administrators' salary.
So, we started Parikrma.
Then came the second school, the third school, the fourth school and a junior college.
Girl: I like adventurous books, and some of my favorites are Alfred Hitchcock and [unclear] and Hardy Boys.
But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world love fast bikes?
All parents all over the world want their children to lead a better life than themselves, but they need to believe that change is possible.
Can you teach us?" So, we started an afterschool for our parents, for our mothers.
They do a very good job because their children are eating their food, but most importantly this is the first time they have got respect, and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile.
There they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset, a totally different society.
And I learned football, volleyball, Frisbee, lots of games.
We've got the best school award for three years successively.
Creating an environment of learning, of inquiry, of exploration is what is true education.
He's in kindergarten.
He comes for a tummy rub, because he believes that will give me luck.
And it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.
And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard, and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains, New York.
Howard does the experiment, and he gets the data back, and he plots it on a curve, and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve.
And this was not good enough for him, and this question bedeviled him for years.
And Howard immediately went on the road, and he would go to conferences around the country, and he would stand up and he would say, "You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi. You're wrong.
And that's where we got zesty pickles.
That's called "adherence."
And he sat them down for two hours, and he gave them, over the course of that two hours, ten bowls.
And sure enough, if you sit down, and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce, you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups.
In six varieties: Cheese, Light, Robusto, Rich &amp; Hearty, Old World Traditional, Extra-Chunky Garden.
People don't know what they want! Right?
Most of you like milky, weak coffee.
Yellow mustard seeds, turmeric, and paprika. That was mustard.
It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now, and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy.
He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste.
This is the way it ought to be.
That's what it was. And why were we attached to that?
It is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability.
And coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafe.
But what actually happened when he signed the contract -- and by the way, he didn't want to sign that contract, he wanted to go to college -- which is what my mother, who actually does love me, said that I should do too, and I did -- well, he didn't do very well. He struggled mightily.
One of my favorites is called subclinical acne.
And yet, if you take, for example, subclinical osteoporosis, a bone thinning disease, the precondition, otherwise known as osteopenia, you would have to treat 270 women for three years in order to prevent one broken bone.
You have to have a high-tech experience of pregnancy, otherwise something might go wrong.
And that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk, which we'll see if that happens for everyone, you will be a pre-vivor.
We've selected, at every point in this system, to do what we do, and to give everyone a precondition and then eventually a condition, in some cases.
I'm responsible.
So when you put another MRI in every corner, you put a robot in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery.
No, he said, "Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit, or just give me a call and let me know how you're doing."
One time in Nova Scotia, when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun -- yeah, same one as in the Carly Simon song, which may or may not refer to James Taylor, Warren Beatty or Mick Jagger; we're not really sure.
So, Dad graduated Harvard in 1946, married my mom, and bought a house in Lexington, Massachusetts, where the first shots were fired against the British in 1775, although we didn't actually hit any of them until Concord.
So, he has four kids, right?
But there's a middle ground, too.
Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.
And it's that third one, especially, where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves.
And they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right; tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom.
So you have things like resemblance, where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted in a couple of different directions: abstracted from resemblance, but still retaining the complete meaning, or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plan.
Comics presents a kind of temporal map.
So, one of the first things that were proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound, motion and interactivity of the CD-ROMs that were being made in those days.
And -- but in comics, in comics, every aspect of the work, every element of the work has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times.
But that's only if you look at the monitor as a page, but not if you look at the monitor as a window.
And notice what's going on here.
See what's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about.
Now, it could be that motion pictures -- and eventually, virtual reality, or something equivalent to it -- some sort of immersive display, is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we're in.
Gabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite writers, for his storytelling, but even more, I think, for the beauty and precision of his prose.
It's highly recommended for anyone who's interested in the translator's art.
Time after time, whenever I set out to share some great truth with a soon-to-be grateful recipient, it had the opposite effect.
Because that's what I take from the theme of this conference: Gained in Translation.
And the key detail of this is that Fey's scripts weren't written by her and they weren't written by the SNL writers.
Now The Daily Show with John Stewart is by far the most -- it's by far the most well-documented example of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy.
And just like that, you've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses.
And that's followed by these lines about gay adoption: What is the problem with gay adoption?
Bill Hicks -- and if you don't know his work, you should really Google him -- Hicks had a routine about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground, where finally the other kid says to him, "Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad," to which Hicks replies, "Really? How soon?"
Clearly, it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue.
And it turned out that Joel and I were both bothered by the same thing, which was how so much of the debate was still focused on the science and how complete it was or wasn't, which, to both of us, seems somewhat intentionally off point.
How about that? How about we create a better world for nothing?
So my suggestion to those of you out here who are seriously focused on creating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and practice thinking funny, because you might just find the question that you've been looking for.
Anyway, so you're in for a treat, because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark.
And I think that if you're not, there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you're in, if you're a designer.
Being serious is hard.
Going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the future is solemn.
But mostly, it's achieved through all those kind of crazy parts of human behavior that don't really make any sense.
That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn, and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you're just jumping right up there.
I thought everybody had a job like that.
And there weren't a lot of books about the history of design in the early 70s. There weren't -- there wasn't a plethora of design publishing.
And that kind of passion drove me into very serious play, a kind of play I could never do now because I'm too well-educated.
There's a Paul Newman movie that I love called "The Verdict."
And I had that moment in 1994 when I met a theater director named George Wolfe, who was going to have me design an identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival, then known, and then became the Public Theater.
And what was different about it was the totality of it, was that I really became the voice, the visual voice, of a place in a way I had never done before, where every aspect -- the smallest ad, the ticket, whatever it was -- was designed by me.
I still work for the Public Theater.
Now -- and I think since the Public Theater, I must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions, and I don't think I ever -- I ever grasped that seriousness again -- I do them for very big, important institutions in New York City.
New Yorkers look at their feet.
Things I never did before, built before.
And there's the building. Everything was painted -- typography over the whole damn thing, including the air conditioning ducts.
But it became the end of the seriousness of the play, and it started to, once again, become solemn.
And this is the bridge they're actually painting up and preparing as we speak.
And it was worth it, because they bought this thing, and it played out on such a grand scale, and it's so internationally recognizable, but for me it was actually a very, very depressing year.
But what I liked about it was, I was controlling my own idiotic information, and I was creating my own palette of information, and I was totally and completely at play.
We began doing these big silkscreen prints, and they started selling, too.
Thank you very much.
And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor, when there was presumably a competition among many languages?
You may just know more about everything than anyone.
About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.
Now this is typically how you see sunfish, this is where they get their common name.
Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution.
They start as little eggs, and they're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.
Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but -- we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild, but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium -- one of the first places to have them in captivity -- they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.
How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world.
And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.
And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents, using temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.
Not so many California sea lions down there.
So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific; we've gone over to another part of the Pacific, and we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.
And so the waiting is really the hardest part.
Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure, that population doesn't get replenished.
And they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer -- which a whole variety of food's in that layer.
And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered, and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.
It was a big idea, for sure, and it was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animations of global data, trends and other information regarding the globe, on this sphere.
The equator's speed is actually about 60 miles per hour.
That's nothing new: that's a propeller clock; that's the rims that you can buy for your car.
And the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case.
That's amazing.
Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing, and I feel really proud, really honored.
Under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously.
So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor, and proceeded to rape her.
Vishnu gave his judgment.
And it's not only about women.
Have we stopped seeing injustice?
And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change, we need a language that reaches through.
She told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dowry Dance.
And that's because there is no clean water to drink, or in countries like India, people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation.
Most houses in Asia and India have a cotton garment.
You know how expensive those are.
And you, you count that she does it right.
Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari.
Your parents were peaceful people.
It's what made you smack your baby brother, stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother.
Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me.
Mainstream art, cinema, has been used across the world to talk about social issues.
Because, any future planning, if 2048 is when we want to get there, unless the arts are put with the scientists, with the economists, with all those who prepare for the future, badly, we're not going to get there.
Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully.
He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.
I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men and I am going to ask them if they defeated correctly.

This is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now.
Leibniz, who came a little bit later -- this is 1679 -- showed that you didn't even need subtraction.
The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather.
If you look at the origins of this, the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here.
Von Neumann, and a logician, and a mathematician from the army put this together. Then, they needed a place to build it.
And Julian Bigelow, who took Zworkykin's place as the engineer, to actually figure out, using electronics, how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this, and women in front, who actually did most of the coding, were the first programmers.
They were using vacuum tubes, very narrow, sloppy techniques to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes.
This is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels.
"Running time: two minutes. Input, output: 90 minutes."
So, already, they're complaining about the manuals: "before closing down in disgust ... " "The General Arithmetic: Operating Logs."
Twenty-four hours a day, this thing was running, mainly running bomb calculations.
There's an inside joke someone has penciled in: "Here lies Marston Mouse."
I know when I'm licked."
So, that was the result. It was Mike, the first thermonuclear bomb, in 1952.
He had a wonderful rapport.
"If it's that easy to create living organisms, why not create a few yourself?"
And he went around the country after that.
So, when I went into these archives looking at this stuff, lo and behold, the archivist came up one day, saying, "I think we found another box that had been thrown out."
You know, could we get them running?
It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned.
Thank you very much.
This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world.
Right?
It's a catastrophe.
In 10 years, it's set to double: 300 billion dollars a year.
I went to West Virginia, the most unhealthy state in America.
She's got six years to live because of the food that she's eaten.
He gets bullied, for God's sake.
And he's fed up with it. He's fed up with burying his friends, his family, his community.
I need you to understand it.
Thirty years ago, most of the food was largely local and largely fresh.
Home.
How are you feeling?
School was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative, do wonderful things, make us earn a living, etc., etc., etc.
I'm not slagging them off.
Pizza for breakfast. They don't even get given crockery.
And this is a little clip from an elementary school, which is very common in England.
JO: Who knows what that is? Uh, pear?
Your kids will be having milk at school, breakfast and lunch. Right?
Okay? There's sugar in everything.
And I've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar, just from milk.
To reboot and make real tangible change, real change, so that I could look you in the white of the eyes and say, "In 10 years time, the history of your children's lives, happiness -- and let's not forget, you're clever if you eat well, you know you're going to live longer -- all of that stuff, it will look different. OK?"
It is done in some, and it needs to be done across the board in America soon, and quick.
But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry, and over a five, six, seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat, sugar, fat and all the other non-food ingredients.
The workplace, we haven't really talked about it.
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay?
Businesses of America need to support Mrs. Obama to do the things that she wants to do.
Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow.
We are but the base of chaos.
And of course, who could escape the irony of a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
They claim that they are battling a dastardly conspiracy.
And unfortunately, for mortals like you and me, we probably can't understand it very well.
And what do you know, nobody else does talk to the hackers.
But I think they're doing very important work.
Now CarderPlanet was very interesting.
They appointed an officer who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser.
And he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004 he would go on sprees in New York, taking out $10,000 from an ATM here, $30,000 from an ATM there, using cloned credit cards.
And I want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who I met while I was doing this research.
As an eight year-old, he and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital because Singhalese mobs were roaming the city, looking for Tamils like Renu to murder.
Max Vision, aka ICEMAN -- mastermind of cardersMarket.
He set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup, bankfrauds@yahoo.co.uk before arriving in Britain in 2005 to take a Masters in chemical engineering at Manchester University.
Remember that, when they developed those hacking skills, their moral compass had not yet developed.
They are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities -- are mobilizing them on behalf of the state.
We just never knew how to get there, what we were doing.
Just from the perspective of climate change, the average urban dweller in the U.S.
And those have been linked then with the rather alarming, growing rates of obesity, shown in these maps here, and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes.
You know, none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs, and they're not going down any time soon.
The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now: the Baby Boomers retiring -- and then there's a gap, Generation X, which is a small generation.
But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again, as we've just continued to sprawl, and they now have a relatively central location.
It's not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was, but it's serving its community.
Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint, a gourmet grocery, and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.
This is Mashpee Commons, the oldest retrofit that we've found.
By 1980, it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right.
There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines.
They're easy to be re-adapted.
But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring -- just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city.
I mean now we're hoping we start to see it; they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.
So they've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time.
I think we have three challenges for the future.
Two, in a hundred years, thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors.
They have urban streetscapes, but suburban parking ratios.
But culturally, we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic, and we expect that.
There is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them.
So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas.
"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina."
There's powder-box, derriere, a pooky, a poochy, a poopy, a poopaloo, a pooninana, a padepachetchki, a pow, and a peach.
And I really haven't gotten off it. I think if you had told me when I was younger that I was going to grow up, and be in shoe stores, and people were going to scream out, "There she is, the Vagina Lady!"
The second thing is that what talking about the vagina did is it opened this door which allowed me to see that there was a way to serve the world to make it better.
What women lined up to tell me was how they were raped, and how they were battered, and how they were beaten, and how they were gang-raped in parking lots, and how they were incested by their uncles.
One woman took that energy and she said, "I want to bring this wave, this energy, to college campuses," and so she took the play and she said, "Let's use the play and have performances of the play once a year, where we can raise money to stop violence against women in local communities all around the world."
It has taken me to Juarez, Mexico, where I was a week ago, where I have literally been there in parking lots where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to Coca-Cola bottles.
But one of the things I've seen is this species -- and it is a species, and it is a new paradigm, and it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media because I don't think good news ever is news, and I don't think people who are transforming the planet are what gets the ratings on TV shows.
I want to talk about three particular people that I've met, vagina warriors, who really transformed my understanding of this whole principle and species, and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez.
He almost murdered me. I left and you can too."
There's another woman named Agnes. And Agnes, for me, epitomizes what a vagina warrior is.
When I was a little girl -- and I grew up in a wealthy community; it was an upper-middle class white community, and it had all the trappings and the looks of a perfectly nice, wonderful, great life.
And in the Masai community, goats and cows are the most valued possession.
Thank you very much.
That was a very Hungarian thing to do, as anyone will attest who remembers 1956.
His name was Sandor Teszler.
The night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks -- it was a hosiery mill, and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock and was shoveling in mountains of socks.
But none who entered that death house had ever come out alive.
And there, Mr. Teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success, especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double-knit.
He also received a visit from the leader of the black community, a minister, who said, "Mr. Teszler, I sure hope you're going to hire some black workers for this new plant of yours."
"No, I reckon I don't."
Wise he was, indeed, but he also had a wonderful sense of humor.
And into the slow, second movement, marked "adagio religioso," he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring; he was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part.
"Yo napot, Sandor!"
They would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece, but it was not a good one."
And what they were arguing about was this: whether the second Harry Potter movie was as good as the first.
This is what I'm passionate about. It is precisely this.
It was a landscape with figures, semi-dressed, drinking wine. There was a nude woman in the lower foreground, and on the hillside in the back, there was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus, and he said, "What is this?"
As I said, he swore too much.
Tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages and, really, well into the 18th century, and it was pretty apparent why.
They have to be wound on huge rollers, shipped in oversized freighters.
I remember taking my son's school class. He was eight at the time, and all the little boys, they kind of -- you know, they were little boys, and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground — — kind of an in-your-face joke by the artist.
That was an interesting case.
I heard over and over again, "Wow, that was worth it.
I'm often asked, "Is digital media replacing the museum?"
Others are very uneasy. It's an intimidating place.
Thank you.
Pat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside.
And we have a school. This is our bright -- we opened [in the] last two years [an] elementary school where we have 850 children, and the majority are women and girls.
If he beat, we will put [him] in jail, and we will call the eldest people.
As my mother said, we are the future hope, and the men are only killing in Somalia.
You're also running a civil society.
That's why I became a doctor.
So that's how I decided [to do] the same.
Most people fled abroad.
PM: What's the best part of working with your mother, and the most challenging part for you?
Wait. Wait.
It's in NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
OK. And what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world.
All the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans were mostly discoveries made by accident.
No, no, that's the only place a ship's been.
And as I will point out later in the presentation, 50 percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea.
Alvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana, and all the major deep submersibles we have, which are about eight.
And our interest in this mountain range, as Earth scientists in those days, was not only because of its tremendous size, dominating the planet, but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin.
And for that reason, you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea.
We couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension.
But the only logical [explanation] was that there were hot springs.
This is what a real one looks like, on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.
No mouth, no gut, no digestive system.
On a 42,000 mile mountain range. Great job security, but not the way to go.
How do you do that? That's water upside down.
Recently, diving off -- in the Gulf of Mexico, finding pools of water, this time not upside down, right side up.
Finding the state of preservation.
And then here's one that sank at the time of Homer, at 750 B.C.
We begin to go on the Hill and lobby.
This is that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea.
A discovery is made, that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later.
We can disseminate.
We need to be not only proud of our universities.
And my final question, my final question -- why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea?
Unfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.
There has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care.
Let's talk about what's suddenly possible.
So we formed Coursera, whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free.
Nick Parlante: For each pixel in the image, set the red to zero.
Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India and would never have access in this case to a Stanford-quality course and would never be able to afford it.
And these would be real homework assignments for a real grade, with a real deadline.
You can break up the material, for example, into these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes, each of which represents a coherent concept.
We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform, as well as other forms of practice in many ways.
This is a kind of simple question that I as an instructor might ask in class, but when I ask that kind of a question in class, 80 percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing I said, 15 percent are zoned out on Facebook, and then there's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it, and I as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer.
We can grade models, whether it's financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.
That didn't go over really well.
Around each one of our courses, a community of students had formed, a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor.
Some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.
And in the context of particular courses, you can ask questions like, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them?
So this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers.
In the individual tutoring instruction, 98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold.
So the goal here is to try and push, and see how far we can get towards the green curve.
We do that by doing active learning in the classroom.
And finally, this would enable a wave of innovation, because amazing talent can be found anywhere.
And so therefore this music you're about to hear is maybe the most important music you'll ever hear in your life.
And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.
And of course we live in a society that's all about contradicting other peoples' reality.
"Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts."
Of course, by talking about science I also may, as I did the other night, incur the violent wrath of some scientists who were very upset with me.
Head is ego, body id.
Richard. Yes but it's also the head, the head of the conference.
"The act of a master taking painful contemptuous possession of her, was the kind of rapture she wanted.
And Ayn Rand of course, Ayn Rand is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism, which reflects another value of Newtonian physics, which is objectivity.
And this still goes on as I think I told you last year.
"We have a lifelong emotional and financial commitment to our Asian Elephant partners."
It seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudice and that you're not really hurting anybody.
There always had to be the butt of a joke.
I really miss the old telemarketers now, I'll tell you that.
And it was like being psychoanalyzed.
I hope that's my agent, because you aren't paying me anything.
When you're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you, or share the same set of assumptions as you, you start to think that that's reality.
That's an actual quality of the trickster.
I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up around five, if that's OK with you.
This is what I tend to see almost more than contradictions.
And then, in economics, there's an active producer and a passive consumer, which explains why business always has to penetrate new markets.
I still have a way to go.
And the mother goes through a second red light.
Finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.
When you go into beauty the probability wave collapses into one possibility.
The science writers and editors -- I shouldn't say science writers, I should say people who write about science -- and editors would sit down over a couple of beers, after a hard day of work, and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works.
Which leads me to a videotape of a President Bush press conference from a couple of weeks ago.
So let's start. Number 10: we lose the will to survive.
Now the problem with all of this, getting older, is that people over 65 are the most likely people to commit suicide.
Moving on. Number nine -- don't laugh -- aliens invade Earth.
So, I don't know how much civilization really has progressed since AD 79, but there's a great likelihood. I really believe this, and I don't believe in aliens, and I don't believe there are any aliens on the Earth or anything like that. But there's a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own.
Secondly -- and you're going to hear more from me about this -- we have to become an outward-looking, space-faring nation.
Many other ecosystems on Earth are in real, real danger.
The problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly, that we don't know they're really in trouble until it's almost too late.
They can't fish there for a radius of 200 miles.
They are expecting to create little, tiny black holes.
We need to -- we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics and what should be done in particle physics, but we need some outside thinking and watchdogging of what's going on with these experiments.
But the thing that's alarming is a couple of months ago, in Mexico, where Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal, they found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants.
Believe it or not, this happens every few hundred thousand years, and has happened many times in our history.
One of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is, is that we have -- you know, we don't have good weather data from 60 years ago, much less data on things like the ozone layer.
Solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the Sun that bombard the Earth with high-speed subatomic particles.
Start terraforming Mars. This is one of my favorite subjects.
A new global epidemic. People have been at war with germs ever since there have been people, and from time to time, the germs sure get the upper hand.
The danger is that some germ like staph will be -- will mutate into something that's really virulent, very contagious, and will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it.
We have a real, major outbreak of disease in the United States, we are not prepared to cope with it.
Most of them should be in orbit around something.
And this is my scariest.
Nothing to worry about, right?
The folks at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey told us last fall -- they're making the first map of the universe, three-dimensional map of the universe -- that there are probably 700,000 asteroids between Mars and Jupiter that are a half a mile big or bigger.
Could we have the solutions?
You'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of, amateur astronomers? That's because nobody's looking for them, except amateurs.
A nuclear explosion is just as hot, but we don't really have anything big enough to melt a 22-mile long asteroid, or vaporize it, would be more like it.
Knowledge is power.
Then he says to himself, very quietly, "[Turbulent the sea,] [Stretching across to Sado] [The Milky Way]."
If we would know the oceans, we must go to the oceans.
The system isn't Chesapeake Bay.
That's the planet that we live on.
This is very, very important because this is the system, this is the crucible, out of which life on the planet came, and it's now time for us to understand it.
Part of the urgency comes from the fact that, of order, a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving.
So people in Kansas, in a wheat field in Kansas, need to understand that the oceans are central to them as well.
This is very, very exciting.
And the program that I wanted to talk to you about just a little bit here, was funded, and it involves autonomous vehicles like the one running across the base of this image.
For a variety of reasons they're dangerous, but we feel that OOI, this Ocean Observatory Initiative, which the National Science Foundation has begun to fund, has the potential to really transform things.
Fiber: next-generation way of communicating.
It's a very powerful system, and most of our communications consist of it.
So anyone coming along later simply accesses the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place.
Or they can transfer control to someone in India or China who can take over for a while, because it's all going to be directly connected through the Internet.
This is what it actually looks like.
Nanotechnology: this is a small generator.
So in the volume of the ocean, we will know, not just the physics and the chemistry, but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis.
Here's an example.
A laboratory: many of you heard what happened on 9/7.
So let me leave you then with a few words from another poet, if you'll forgive me.
And yet, when I look at the environment outside, you see how resistant architecture is to change.
And that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities, the greatest spaces that we have had.
It's something very personal.
And yet it is in times like this that I think architecture can thrive with big ideas, ideas that are not small. Think of the great cities.
That's what expression is.
Radical, what does it mean? It's something which is rooted, and something which is rooted deep in a tradition.
It's about conserving emotions, conserving the traditions that have obstructed the mind in moving forward and of course what is radical is to confront them.
And of course, we are all about the struggle of emotions.
So the important thing actually, is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions, which might be totally inexplicable in words, because they operate in proportions, in materials, in light.
And I think when I draw drawings which may imitate the computer, but are not computer drawings -- drawings that can come from sources that are completely not known, not normal, not seen, yet the hand -- and that's what I really, to all of you who are working -- how can we make the computer respond to our hand rather than the hand responding to the computer.
And yet, our lives are complex.
So again, the evasion of that sphere, which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture, the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object has never appealed to me.
So the reality of architecture is visceral. It's not intellectual.
You know Frank Gehry's buildings, they will continue to be unexpected in the future.
So the rawness, I think, in space, the fact that sustainability can actually, in the future translate into a raw space, a space that isn't decorated, a space that is not mannered in any source, but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature, might be refractive to our desires.
So that is indeed what is memory.
There would be nowhere to turn.
Cities should be full of vibrations, full of sound, full of music.
So yes, I do believe that the risk we take in every building.
These are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us, but are important for everybody in this world.
We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful.
And yet, in all its messiness, in all its difficulties, I would not have liked somebody to say, "This is the tabula rasa, mister architect -- do whatever you want."
I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others, looking at America from that point of view.
You have to fight for what you believe. You don't always win everything you want to win. But you can steer the process.
It is about a country in the southwest of Africa called Namibia.
I'm a Himba.
Walk up to it and smack it on the backside."
And it is very important if you are in the field to know what to confront and what to run from.
They could sell these things for anything between $5,000 a kilo.
But even today, that memory is still in people's minds.
Death and despair surrounded Joshua and our entire communities.
And thus, as people started feeling ownership over wildlife, wildlife numbers started coming back, and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia.
We learned these things from outsiders.
The best one, like my father -- I'm not campaigning for my father -- they were put in charge to stop others from poaching.
And so far, with the support of World Wildlife Fund, we've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today.
The black rhino -- they were almost extinct in 1982.
Nowhere else in the world has community-adopted conservation at this scale.
I like that one: Namibia serving as a model to Africa, and Africa serving as a model to the United States.
I want to know how I impact them.
Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource, suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency.
Pole caught -- no bycatch.
That's great! I love red wine!
Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman, but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.
This is an easy sell.
Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.
It doesn't work.
I made more money.
Shellfish, mussels, oysters, clams, tilapia, char -- these were the common species.
Get a knife. Cut it into four portions.
And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents.
Eat your vegetables.
We've seen an image of our blue planet, our world bank.
Art, of course, looks at the world through the psyche, the emotions -- the unconscious at times -- and of course the aesthetic.
It's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action.
That's outside Antarctica.
When I realized that climate change was real, and it was not based on computer models, I decided that one day I would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically.
We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet.
Our time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland, and we have repeat photography positions, that is places we just visit on an annual basis, in British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia.
You know, scientists have collected this kind of information off and on over the years, but a lot of it stays within the science community.
And several things are important.
Earth is having a fever.
This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months.
This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago.
This is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do -- you put some cheesy illustration on your shot, right? -- and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points.
Now we turn on our time lapse.
The images make the invisible visible.
One of my favorite glaciers, the Sólheimajökull.
That's where it ended a few months ago.
Here's a two-year record of what that looks like.
This glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past 15 years.
So an illustration again, gives you a feeling for scale.
But what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet.
Over the last two decades, India has become a global hub for software development and offshoring of back office services, as we call it, and what we were interested in finding out was that because of this huge industry that has started over the last two decades in India, offshoring software development and back office services, there's been a flight of white collar jobs from the developed world to India.
Initially, or, you know, as people would say, you know, in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting the Western innovative model, say, "Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras, if the Indians are so bloody smart?"
Well, interestingly, what you find there is, usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the R&amp;D center as they may call it, and more often than not, it's an Indian.
It could be new products and services, but it could also be new ways of producing products.
They were working on truly global products, and companies like Microsoft, Google, AstraZeneca, General Electric, Philips, have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore and Hyderabad R&amp;D centers they are able to produce products and services for the world.
The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies, where many companies today are contracting Indian companies to do a major part of their product development work for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world.
What happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart, young, ambitious kids on a call center job?
Now, this has, of course, some implications, and so we developed three implications of this research.
The second thing we bring up is what we call the browning of the TMT, the top management teams.
Here is the profile of employees of IBM over the last decade.
Thomas Dolby: For pure pleasure please welcome the lovely, the delectable, and the bilingual Rachelle Garniez.
Following three years of work in Somalia, I got picked up by the World Health Organization, and got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS.
It's full of panic and fear, and I'd heard the women wailing and crying in the desert.
And now I do that.
And besides that, it reminded me of ancient epidemics that were previously completely misunderstood because the science hadn't been there before, epidemics of plague or typhus or leprosy, where the prevalent ideas were that there were bad people or bad humors or bad air, and widows were dragged around the moat, and dungeons were part of the solution.
Frequently, a strategy has to be rethought.
And it also looked like infectious epidemics.
Make sense?
So violence interruptors hired from the same group, credibility, trust, access, just like the health workers in Somalia, but designed for a different category, and trained in persuasion, cooling people down, buying time, reframing.
And so we had to then, fortunately, get the funds to repeat this experience, and this is one of the next four neighborhoods that had a 45-percent drop in shootings and killings.
In other words, what do you mean, health problem?
Yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases in places with awful economies without healing the economy.
So the theory, in a way, is kind of being validated by the treatment.
This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times.
Coppola's script describes these guys as, "exhausted in shirt sleeves.
I figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really, aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it, right?
No, feel free to follow along on your Blackberries or your iPhones if you've got them.
Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this?
Homer Simpson: We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room -- You mean if I want pork chops, even in the middle of the night, your guy will fry them up?
When Homer Simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock, but the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400 on the birthday of the Baby Jesus.
My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on Inauguration Day, I was still changing it."
And I noticed, he's not exactly around here today to face any tough questions.
And once our lives are touched by cancer, we quickly learn that there are basically three weapons, or three tools, that are available to fight the disease: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
And electric fields are not magnetism.
And as they land, they're fully aligned in the gravitational field.
As cell division begins the nucleus disintegrates, the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell and those special proteins undergo a three-dimensional sequence whereby they attach and they literally click into place end-on-end to form chains.
What I'm going to show you next are two in vitro experiments.
The one within the circle manages.
The first cancer that we have focused on is the deadly brain cancer, GBM.
And then the second group received only Tumor Treating Field therapy.
He won the gold medal in Moscow in the 4,000 meter pursuit.
That cloudy white mass that you see is the recurrence of the tumor.
There's none of what is called the "chemo head."
By month 12, we could argue whether there's a little bit of material around the edges, but it's essentially completely gone.
I'm going to show you another clip of a woman named Lydia.
She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids.
We have more trials planned for lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer.
The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters.
But for the desert society this is no program; this is their life.
And the water will go where it should go.
Because we are used to get written things.
The age is 400 years.
And we request them.
So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away, soon it become like this.
And people started renovating their own structures.
None of us were able to go to Europe, but Jaisalmer was well connected to it.
So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body.
And then they will come and worship this pond, pay respect, their gratitude.
Dry water body. Children are standing on a very difficult device to explain.
And where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water.
Your own thing, not personal property, my property, every time.
If it comes up, some of them will be submerged.
but not to create the engineering colleges.
You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this.
These artifacts and designs are inspiring.
If it is there it can be done right now.
The battle against malaria is being won, with deaths from malaria down 27 percent, according to the latest World Bank data.
And the West is engaging with that.
Africa, many African countries, are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP.
And they're investing in energy.
Which means you're going to have new guys knocking on the door saying, "Give us a job," and, "I don't need a big pay rise, just please give me a job."
I think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic?
It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist.
And what you'll see here is that most Africans are now living in democracies.
Education is helping growth and investment, and that's giving budget revenues, which is giving governments more money, which is helping growth through education.
Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt.
Because the question really is, what happens next?
No offense.
Boom! India began to explode.
And when I present this in Africa -- Nairobi, Lagos, Accra -- I get one question.
You can go and download some of the great African literature from the Internet now.
Thank you very much.
It was never popular with many political leaders, especially those in the United States who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn't.
And again, I think this is kind of false.
So you may wonder, why on Earth are they doing it?
And for those of you who didn't know, I'll just give a little summary.
Within days the entire incident was forgotten, which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content.
They don't really have the data they need in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime.
Because what happens is that then you can actually point to this initiative and say, "Well, we are having a democracy. We are having a forum."
Now you actually know how they connect to each other by looking at their Facebook page.
And this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it because the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people and it plays a completely different social role for them.
Because even what has been happening up 'til now with the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation, there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard.
They're 11 and 12.
Explain to me what's wrong.
What am I doing? Why would I do this?"
My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out, but my father and I stayed in the limousine, and no sooner than the women got out, he burst out crying.
It took me back to a time when I was about 12 years old.
His mother had died from a heroin overdose.
We all looked up to him.
Because for me growing up at that time, and our relationship with this man box, "Do you want some?" meant one of two things: sex or drugs -- and we weren't doing drugs.
Women are objects, especially sexual objects.
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.
So now there's a living room full of guys.
We as men, good men, the large majority of men, we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization.
I remember asking a nine-year-old boy, I asked a nine-year-old boy, "What would life be like for you, if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?"
If it's population, we're on course to top the charts.
Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic, Joseph Nye, a friend of mine.
Now, in this age, again, countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage.
And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.
But half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces, there would be no dial tone.
But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.
Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones.
And the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad."
Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problem Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world.
Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch -- so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency -- about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif* stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers, its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors, any moving part they could find, at 8:30, because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.
Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.
It's a civilizational story to begin with.
And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population keeps growing by 20 million a year.
And ultimately, it seems to me, that always works better than propaganda.
But, the whole point is that India is the nationalism of an idea.
Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.
Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations, at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.
The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year. The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma, all you have to do is wash your face: no medicine, no pills, no injections.
So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available.
Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath, and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas, two hours more for school, two hours more for homework, two hours more to just be a kid.
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.
But I said we can't get rid of it, because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can't get rid of that immunity.
And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.
This thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there, sort of symbolizing this right now.
And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular, and direct your immune system to it.
But now, I'm not talking about gorking people out to fly to Mars or even Pandora, as much fun as that may be.
To suggest that this all, sort of, about little, tiny creatures, I want to bring it close to home.
So these ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and weird, little organisms.
The next day, she was doing so well, they wanted to run tests on her.
Well, I have to tell you something very odd, and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill.
So this was pretty shocking to me, that we could do this.
And so we wondered: Might there be some agent that is in us, something that we make ourselves, that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility in such a way as to be able to survive when we got extremely cold, and might otherwise pass away?
Ken Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure.
We make it ourselves.
So that's kind of a tough day, but I said, "There really is some basis for thinking why you might want to do this."
So, it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold.
Now, we'd found a way to reduce its oxygen consumption to rock-bottom levels, and it was fine.
If you give mice hydrogen sulfide, you can lower their demand for oxygen, and you can put them into oxygen concentrations that are as low as 5,000 feet above the top of Mt. Everest, and they can sit there for hours, and there's no problem.
And I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low, incredibly low.
Also, the brilliant scientists who work at my lab and also others on staff, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington -- wonderful place to work.
A miracle?
Do you know of any painting that didn't have a painter? Yes/No.
We adore babies because they're so cute.
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved.
If we hadn't, then probably this would be the height of sexiness.
And there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness. Here's a pretty good example.
And I won't be able to say too much about it.
He's a computer scientist, Reginald Adams a psychologist, and there I am, and we're putting this together into a book.
Because I think you will find, when we talk about cities, we are talking about the political institutions in which civilization and culture were born.
Cities endure the ages.
So cities are where the action is.
And then all the things we know a little better, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Mexican Conference of Mayors, the European Conference of Mayors.
Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said, we could never get away here in Philadelphia with the stuff that goes on in Washington, the paralysis, the non-action, the inaction.
They fix sewers, they get the trains running.
They get things done.
It's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor.
That's the difference, and the difference has to do with the character of cities themselves, because cities are profoundly multicultural, open, participatory, democratic, able to work with one another.
In Copenhagen, four or five years ago, 184 nations came together to explain to one another why their sovereignty didn't permit them to deal with the grave, grave crisis of climate change, but the mayor of Copenhagen had invited 200 mayors to attend.
Cities are doing this, but not just one by one.
That is the real world, and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or democratize globalization, we will increasingly not only risk the failure to address all of these transnational problems, but we will risk losing democracy itself, locked up in the old nation-state box, unable to address global problems democratically.
That's an idea. It's in my conception of the coming world, but it's also on the table in City Halls in Seoul, Korea, in Amsterdam, in Hamburg, and in New York.
And in fact, my friend and IDEO founder, David Kelley, who's out there somewhere, studied under him at Stanford.
You've got 30 seconds, you'd better be fast.
He got exactly the same response: lots and lots of sorry's.
Where they have the same kind of security to take risks.
So, whether it's this microbus meeting room that we have in one our buildings at IDEO; or at Pixar, where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves; or at the Googleplex, where it's famous for its [beach] volleyball courts, and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it.
It's a toy; it's called a "finger blaster."
I'm going to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get those things onto the stage.
Well, they're still coming in from the back there; they're still coming in.
So, ah, that was fun.
Now, an adult encountering a new situation -- when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know.
This is some aluminum foil, right? You use it in the kitchen.
Yeah, thought so. So we've all seen it, haven't we?
So it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this.
15? 20? Anybody get all 30?
We stop ourselves from doing things.
McKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity.
And so, some of the things that they figured out, some of these individuals figured out; in one case, a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients; a design of a solar space probe experiment; a redesign of the linear electron accelerator; an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder -- you can tell this is a while ago; the completion of a line of furniture; and even a new conceptual model of the photon.
And somehow that seems wrong.
Through constant experimentation with materials, they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today, eventually resulting in, of course, the legendary lounge chair.
When play is about building a tower out of blocks, the kid begins to learn a lot about towers.
They were meeting with them; they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device.
So when designers are working on ideas, they can start building stuff whenever they want.
And of course, by building quick prototypes, we can get out and test our ideas with consumers and users much more quickly than if we're trying to describe them through words.
But a place, I think, where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems -- things like education or security or finance or health.
So when, as adults, we role-play, then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized.
One of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didn't want the doctors and nurses thinking he was actually sick, and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later.
He wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter.
And to certain extent it is, but I want to stress a couple of points.
That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing, difficult situation into a fun game.
I think they're two quite different modes: divergence and convergence.
So to sum it up, we need trust to play, and we need trust to be creative. So, there's a connection.
Reaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.
And the only thing that came was creative block.
I bought a fast car.
And clients didn't call.
I had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short, did all the things that took me back up to success.
It's a continuous journey.
They wouldn't have me.
And about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said, "Listen, you've got to join choir.
And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out.
My name is Britlin Losee, and this is a video that I'd like to make for you.
I actually wrote, "OMG," hopefully for the last time in public ever.
This is Evangelina Etienne from Massachusetts.
And from the crowd emerged this young man, Scott Haines.
I'll stop it there in the interest of time.
We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it.
This is Beau Awtin.
And I've just chosen a few of them here.
"It hurt so much, and I shed some tears, but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words.
There are people now online that are friends; they've never met.
You're the very first people to see this.
Which means that what I consider moral or immoral based on that might not necessarily be what you consider moral or immoral.
This here is Nissan's MyLeaf, where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people, so you can compete for who drives around the most fuel efficiently.
It's better when you care about yourself than how you appear in front of other people.
It is a technology that empowers the individual to determine its own life course, to shape itself.
And we can question these values.
We're asking things like, Is this Oxfam donation form -- where the regular monthly donation is the preset default and people, maybe without intending it, are that way encouraged or nudged into giving a regular donation instead of a one-time donation -- is that still permissible?
But really it means excellence.
I don't know whether you know the great communication researcher Paul Watzlawick who, back in the '60s, made the argument we cannot not communicate.
We organize the existence of people.
So these are the kinds of layers, the kinds of questions I wanted to lead you through today -- the question of, What are the intentions that you bring to bear when you're designing something?
"Why should the lamp or the house be an art object, but not our life?"
This is me being inspired by my first tutor, my mom, and this is me teaching Introduction to Artificial Intelligence to 200 students at Stanford University.
We were thrilled to have that kind of audience, and just a bit terrified that we hadn't finished preparing the class yet.
Our typical video is two minutes, sometimes shorter, never more than six, and then we pause for a quiz question, to make it feel like one-on-one tutoring.
We didn't want students to memorize the formulas; we wanted to change the way they looked at the world.
This motivated the students to keep going, and it also meant that everybody was working on the same thing at the same time, so if you went into a discussion forum, you could get an answer from a peer within minutes.
It was crucial that the students see that we're working hard for them and they're all supporting each other.
But to me, the most exciting part of it is the data that we're gathering.
And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound, it actually turns out to be a very difficult project.
Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod, and these guys open up snails for a living.
And I immediately came upon a problem.
And low light is a critical issue with filming animals, because if it's too high, you fry them.
And we were in for our first surprise.
And what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract, and a latch that prevents anything from moving.
So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb, whether it's a spearer or a smasher, is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here.
And I'll just do that one more time.
So if you're going to build a thin gold structure, it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong.
So the next and final question was, well, how much force does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails?
And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell.
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks.
And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light.
So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further, I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail.
So, one question I often get after this talk -- so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?
And this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring.
So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring.
And Hawkes: "it's not earth, stupid, it's ocean."
If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth, and I held up another square that was the root two square -- so it's 1.5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans; and I said, what is the relative value of these two things?
That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority.
If you look at that sub, you'll see a sphere.
You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat.
They don't. Their mothers don't say to little baby fish, "Careful you don't fall over."
OK, this is good stuff.
There I am; I see her coming back, coming up underneath me.
There're no silly buoyancy tanks -- it's permanently, positively buoyant.
But look here. Instead of blowing tanks and coming up slowly without thinking about it, it's a little bit of back pressure, and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water.
We've been just feet apart. I'm going back down now."
You see the larger wing area here.
Where the hell that goes, I don't know, but it's a lot of fun.
I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land, from the great Central Valley of California to the bedrock of Manhattan, has really shaped our history and our character.
I mean, these sort of top-down, mono-functional, capital-intensive solutions are really not going to cut it.
Here's a map of my city, New York City, showing inundation in red.
When we started this project, one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there.
And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal.
They really become nature's wave attenuators.
And with a $20 billion price tag, we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what's in front of us.
It also creates this incredibly interesting, I think, new amphibious public space, where you can imagine working, you can imagine recreating in a new way.
You can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them.
And the second one is: when can we eat the oysters?
But I think the most important one is that London was this city of 2.5 million people, and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point.
Not just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk, that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died, and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street.
So what ended up happening, actually, is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water.
And then on one day, August 28th of 1854, a young child, a five-month-old girl whose first name we don't know, we know her only as Baby Lewis, somehow contracted cholera, came down with cholera at 40 Broad Street.
He suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source.
Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood.
And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since.
A fact came out of MIT, couple of years ago. Ken Hale, who's a linguist, said that of the 6,000 languages spoken on Earth right now, 3,000 aren't spoken by the children.
She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country.
And he was beaten, starved, tortured -- lost all his teeth while in prison.
I interview and do portraits.
And they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau, way in the western part of the country.
And he's never been back to his country since.
And this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon -- oil was discovered in 1972.
This is Yadira, and Yadira is five years old. She's in a tribe that's neighboring the Huaorani.
One of the things I did just before 9/11 -- August of 2001 -- I took my son, Dax, who was 16 at the time, and I took him to Pakistan.
In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora, the area where Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area.
We now have 15 sites.
And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in, and this has worked the best.
That was one of the big motivating factors.
A week before we got to the workshop, a massive landslide, caused by Hurricane Stan, last October, came in and buried 600 people alive in their village.
And so the question is: how did that material get here?
So there's a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here.
But when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see more galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum.
The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal, right, unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.
I mean, it just gives you the scale.
It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun; you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun.
And later this year -- this is the cool stealth version, the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it, and you should look -- the Planck satellite will be launched, and it will make very high-resolution maps.
And so this is a pretty weird model, right?
And you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall, but there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it.
So there's an interesting pattern, but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern.
And you'll see, first, the structure of the survey, and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there.
That is, we have to seriously play God, not just change people's lives, but make the universe, right.
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.
Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern.
We're going to keep zooming in. OK.
So they're simple building blocks.
You see a filament, you see the light is the invisible matter, and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.
And so here we are.
And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on.
At the beginning it's very uniform.
So we're able to do the simulation, but this is two days on a desktop.
You can see, well, you can, kind of pick out all the major continents, but that's about it.
We live in an incredibly busy world.
And this is an extraordinary thing, right?
That's really not how it has to be.
I guess we all deal with stress in different ways.
But it was more than that.
And the beauty of it is that even though it need only take about 10 minutes a day, it impacts our entire life.
Equally, if I relax too much talking to you, then there's no way I can focus on the balls. I'm going to drop them.
You go back to it, repeat it. "Oh, I am worried.
But when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way, you might see many different patterns.
All you need to do is to take 10 minutes out a day to step back, to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus, calm and clarity in your life.
And after spending all my life wanting to do art, I left art school, and then I left art completely.
So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn't affect the work, like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas, or, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours, creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch.
But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind.
What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies?
So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam.
The last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place.
As I destroyed each project, I was learning to let go, let go of outcomes, let go of failures, and let go of imperfections.
Looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life.
So I was filming.
And almost all of them are women, the men having shorter lifespans in part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes, if not radiation.
Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages, eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic, totally contaminated.
Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor, killed millions of Ukrainians, and they faced the Nazis in the '40s, who came through slashing, burning, raping, and in fact many of these women were shipped to Germany as forced labor.
And there's a patina of simple defiance among them.
Now, like many of you, I have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life.
What sounds like faith, soft faith, may actually be fact, because the surprising truth -- I mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on Earth for the last 27 years, have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation, by some estimates up to 10 years.

1996, when I gave my first TEDTalk, Rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row.
My daughter's 20. She's a college student.
They text and shop and go on Facebook during classes, during presentations, actually during all meetings.
Why does this matter?
A 50-year-old business man lamented to me that he feels he doesn't have colleagues anymore at work.
An 18-year-old boy who uses texting for almost everything says to me wistfully, "Someday, someday, but certainly not now, I'd like to learn how to have a conversation."
And when we do, one of the things that can happen is that we sacrifice conversation for mere connection.
For kids growing up, that skill is the bedrock of development.
Have we so lost confidence that we will be there for each other?
And we're vulnerable.
And I believe it's because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable.
And that third idea, that we will never have to be alone, is central to changing our psyches.
The best way to describe it is, I share therefore I am.
You end up isolated if you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude, the ability to be separate, to gather yourself.
When I spoke at TED in 1996, reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities, I said, "Those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of self-reflection."
I see some first steps.
Because it's when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words that we reveal ourselves to each other.
It's like calling in the cavalry.
I coined my own definition of success in 1934, when I was teaching at a high school in South Bend, Indiana, being a little bit disappointed, and delusioned perhaps, by the way parents of the youngsters in my English classes expected their youngsters to get an A or a B. They thought a C was all right for the neighbors' children, because the neighbors children are all average.
And I wanted to come up with something that I hoped could make me a better teacher, and give the youngsters under my supervision -- whether it be in athletics or in the English classroom -- something to which to aspire, other than just a higher mark in the classroom, or more points in some athletic contest.
'I failed!' He cried.
There are some things that helped me, I think, be better than I would have been. I know I'm not what I ought to be, not what I should be. But I think I'm better than I would have been if I hadn't run across certain things.
And about the same time I ran across this one verse, I ran across another one. Someone asked a lady teacher why she taught.
They ask me why I teach and I reply, 'Where could I find such splendid company?'" And I believe the teaching profession -- it's true, you have so many youngsters.
Later on I said certain things -- I had -- players, if we're leaving for somewhere, had to be neat and clean.
I believe you should be on time. But I felt at practice, for example, we start on time, we close on time.
One word of profanity, and you are out of here for the day.
That's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time.
And we forget there is no progress without change.
I'd never seen that before, but he did.
Yet losing, not afraid to fall, if bravely we have given all. For who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span.
Never mention winning. My idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game.
I believe it was -- one great philosopher said -- no, no, Cervantes. Cervantes said, "The journey is better than the end."
And I said, "Well, I'd want one that knew why he was at UCL to get an education, he was a good student, really knew why he was there in the first place.
I'd want them to be able to rebound well at both ends, too.
And here I thought he'd never play a minute, when he was -- so those are the things that give you great joy, and great satisfaction to see one.
So I consider them to be as successful as Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton, or many of the others that we had, There was some outstanding -- some outstanding players.
So that's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine.
It's titled "The Culture of Organs."
The second challenge was cells.
This is actually a biomaterial.
We can also use cells alone.
We then tease the cells apart, we grow the cells outside the body.
It has the same conditions as the human body -- 37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen.
You can hold it like a liver, but it has no cells; it's just a skeleton of the liver.
You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it.
This is how it actually works.
I don't know if you realize this, but 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney.
So while we've been talking today, you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage.
Has a little bit of consistency to it.
Luke Massella: I was really sick. I could barely get out of bed.
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends.
I'm a sophomore and studying communications, TV and mass media, and basically trying to live life like a normal kid, which I always wanted growing up.
All I wanted to do was to get better, and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing.
So today I'm going to talk to you about the rise of collaborative consumption.
So there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us, but with immediate latent value to someone else.
Lo and behold, there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron who wanted swap his or her "like new" copy of "Sex and the City" for my copy of "24."
Namely, that technology is enabling trust between strangers.
Over the next minute, you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head.
I mean, we're monkeys, and we're born and bred to share and cooperate.
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists, and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall, when Mother Nature and the market both said, "No more."
These four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century, defined by hyper-consumption, towards the 21st century, defined by collaborative consumption.
This is the sharing of resources of things like money, skills and time.
This idea is particularly powerful for things that have high-idling capacity.
The average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run.
But my favorite statistic is that 100 out of the 250 participants did not want their keys back.
I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.
But now with the Web, we leave a trail.
I believe it will be referred to as a revolution, so to speak -- when society, faced with great challenges, made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good.
I had never in my life ever tasted candy.
And I finished high school. And just walking, I found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the United States.
But there were two men: one man was blind, one man had no legs -- he was born like that.
And these guys took off, followed the footsteps of the villagers until they found and passed them.
A man has to be transported in a wheelbarrow 20, 30 kilometers for a hospital. No clean drinking water.
I'm using the knowledge I received from the United States and from my community to move them forward.
Morgan O'Neill: So, on June 1st we weren't disaster experts, but on June 3rd we started faking it.
I'm a PhD student at MIT, and I happen to study atmospheric science.
CO: We walked up to the church because we heard that they had hot meals, but when we arrived we found problems.
CO: Yeah, and we need a hotline. Can you make a Google Voice number?
MO: The insurance won't cover it? You need a crew to tar your roof? CO: Six packs of juice boxes arriving in one hour?
So this is what filled our days.
MO: Lying on the ground after another 17-hour day, Caitria and I would empty our pockets and try to place dozens of scraps of paper into context -- all bits of information that had to be remembered and matched in order to help someone.
MO: The tools. Large aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear after a disaster, but they often fulfill very specific missions and then they leave.
And you've only got about seven days to capture 50 percent of all of the Web searches that will ever be made to help your area.
Data is inherently unsexy, but it can jumpstart an area's recovery.
Alvin, our software engineer and cofounder, has built these tools.
Imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place before a disaster.
They have hotlines and spreadsheets and data.
Let me show you some images of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow.
So, I had been there almost three months, and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyed and at certain points we were walking around, he grabbed my hand for support, which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing.
2030 -- two billion squatters, one in four people on the planet.
They did have electricity, but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires, and could only power one feeble bulb.
"After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie, put on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare.
The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs.
'Once you have stayed here,' he said, 'you can stay for the rest of your life.'" So, he has hope, and this is where these communities start.
They develop -- you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other, room, after room, after room.
Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community.
So, that's just a rock in the hillside.
This here, on the right-hand side, is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- it's a hotel.
This is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place, and that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do: they steal electricity; they install a pump and they tap into the water main, and pump water up to their houses.
And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable.
That's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median.
So, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book, from what Armstrong said, and from all these people, is that these are neighborhoods.
Little did I know that I would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true.
When I was five, I went to school and I learned braille.
When I was in high school, I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder, and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer medium of learning.
Students, family and friends all read me material.
And you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen.
I'd written my first coauthored labor law book on a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory.
For example, I was too shy then, and I'm actually too shy now, to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material.
But in 1989, he teamed up with Bill Joyce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the Net or from what was on the computer.
But, you know, I find reading with machines a very lonely process.
But when I'm reading with synthetic voices, I love to come home and read a racy novel with a real voice.
In Argentina, there are 50,000.
My life has been extraordinarily blessed with marriage and children and certainly interesting work to do, whether it be at the University of Sydney Law School, where I served a term as dean, or now as I sit on the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in Geneva.
Yay!
By 2050, it's going to be a column and will start to invert.
That would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do.
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea.
Thank you.
Our economies in the developed world have coasted along on something pretty close to full employment.
Not that there's a lot of competition, right?
And there's actually a huge amount of truth here.
Right? Great, hang up, flourish, go home.
It looks like it might be great news for Ford, but it's actually not. If you want to sell huge volumes of somewhat expensive goods to people, you really want a large, stable, prosperous middle class.
So this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about.
For example, in 1960 they were both very likely to have full-time jobs, working at least 40 hours a week.
So I cannot tell a happy story about these social trends, and they don't show any signs of reversing themselves.
Now, that's probably making some folk in this room uncomfortable, because that idea is associated with the extreme left wing and with fairly radical schemes for redistributing wealth.
The school stopped in third grade, so then I entered the public school system, and it felt like I had been sent to the Gulag.
I don't want to pretend for a minute that what we have is going to be enough.
We could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip.
The great point is to give them the plain facts."
And in the worship of my church, the most frequently used adjective about God is "almighty."
These ideas are well known in liberal academic circles, but clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them, for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities, for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers.
If the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers, holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now, there are no words that we could say to him.
In some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within.
And the answer was, "God is in this with us, or God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore."
And last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs, "The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock."
I can remember someone saying this to me, with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of God.
Afterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them.
Perhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen, so that heroism and compassion can be shown.
Or perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning and then relinquished control forever, so that natural processes could occur, and evolution run its course.
Early religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person, doing things all over the place.
In the natural cycle of life and death, the creation and destruction that must happen continuously.
It's hard to conceive, and begs more questions.
How could one practice such a faith?
Namaste.
Ways that might allow us to go on, down a new and uncharted road.
If you search for the word "technology," it was not used until 1952.
It's not roads, or penicillin, or factory tires; it's the new stuff.
And so, they had minimal technology, but they had some technology.
And grandparents are very important, because they are the transmitter of cultural evolution and information.
But when the scarcity came when the highs and lows and the droughts came, then people went into starvation.
Our bodies have adapted to these new diets.
All the things that we see today that are changing our lives, we can always trace back to the introduction of some new technology.
My working definition of technology is "anything useful that a human mind makes."
It's the increased order.
And the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a PC chip.
But technology has its own agenda, like anything, like life itself.
You can take all kinds of curves, and they're all pointing up.
So, technology is selfish; technology is generous.
We fix it, but most importantly, we relocate it.
But DDT sprayed on local homes, there's nothing better to eliminate malaria, besides insect DDT-impregnated mosquito nets.
That's what we get from technology all the time. That's why people leave villages and go into cities, is because they are always gravitating towards increased choices and possibilities.
It's more than just gadgets; it's more than just things that people invent.
So, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things.
And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level, in their reading and writing in particular.
And at the same time, I thought about this massive group of people I knew: writers, editors, journalists, graduate students, assistant professors, you name it.
So we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway, why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school, get extra help on their written homework, so you have basically no border between these two communities?"
And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell, but we did all the necessary research.
We have the peg legs there, that are all handmade and fitted to you.
The kids would come in -- or we thought they would come in. I should back up.
And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in.
And so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home.
And then secondly, there's a publishing company in the back.
There's a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem, especially for the adults working at McSweeney's who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up, was that there was just the one bathroom.
There you have it, you know -- one-on-one attention.
So every day, there's a field trip where they together create a book -- you can see it being typed up above.
The teachers that we work with -- and everything is different to teachers -- they tell us what to do.
Whoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class.
So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said, "Hey, why don't you assign a book with high school students?
We had a big party at the end.
We sell all the student books.
People would come in and say, "What the --?
It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.
So they opened this place. Inside, it's like a Costco for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form.
This is a secret identity kit.
All the designers, all of the builders, everybody was local, all the time was pro-bono.
Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home.
And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space, at a benefit for 826 New York. So he's there every day.
These are spaces that are only affiliated with us, doing this same thing: Word St. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts; Ink Spot in Cincinnati; Youth Speaks, San Francisco, California, which inspired us; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis; Austin Bat Cave in Austin; Fighting Words in Dublin, Ireland, started by Roddy Doyle, this will be open in April.
We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community.
If you have any questions, you can ask this guy, who's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone.
Thank you so much.
I went back to my bed, and I prayed, and I secretly thanked God that that missile did not land on my family's home, that it did not kill my family that night.
You see, I grew up in war-torn Iraq, and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it.
In my travels and in my work, from Congo to Afghanistan, from Sudan to Rwanda, I have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same, but the fears of war are the same.
She said, "But it's not fair, because there is only one life, and there should only be one death."
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children.
Checkmate.
Do you know -- do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going?
We must have a full picture of what that means.
And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion, but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion.
She got into Women for Women International's program.
That mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do.
Ideas, language, even the phrase 'each other' no longer makes any sense."
But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this.
After I wrote "The Laws of Simplicity," I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine.
And she has this show, "The Simple Life."
It's a very simple sign, it says, "road" and "road approaching."
We love relationships -- very complex. So we love this kind of stuff.
Last year at TED, these were all my titles. I had a lot of titles.
It's very hard work to make tofu.
Who knows Muriel Cooper? Muriel Cooper?
The great graphic designer Paul Rand designed the IBM logo, the Westinghouse logo.
The T doesn't stand for "human," it stands for "technology."
So, somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined, I think.
I did this series of calendars for Shiseido.
Tomorrow, Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola.
I've been interested in computer programs all my life, actually.
And also, one year, the G3 Bondi Blue thing -- that caddy would come out, like, dangerous, like, "whack," like that.
It was very good, and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this, actually, in different forms.
I discovered that Cheetos are good, expressive material.
It's a strange business model. I can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte.
And I wrote this book, "The Laws of Simplicity."
Because I want to simplify them for you.
And so, to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life with more enjoyment and less pain.
Like everything you see, every time you wake up.
And if you have your vision, vision is interesting.
And this is the fourth time, and I come here for this wisdom, I think.
How dare we be optimistic?
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time.
We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources and political will. But the political will has to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources.
The amount that disappeared in 2005 was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi.
It's three times hotter than Mercury, which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly, here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images, but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate.
What is missing is a sense of urgency.
But it's not just the developed nations.
Put a price on carbon. We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral, to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck -- and some things have changed since the 19th century.
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense.
We can't wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture.
This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet.
Let's do that. Thank you very much.
So they're saying the right things and they may -- whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing, but let me tell you: when I came back from Kyoto in 1997, with a feeling of great happiness that we'd gotten that breakthrough there, and then confronted the United States Senate, only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote to confirm, to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say.
Have a moratorium -- we shouldn't have any new coal-fired generating plants that aren't able to capture and store CO2, which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources.
We can change things, but we have to actively change.
I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design; I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art.
You work over different time zones, you talk to very different people, you multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically.
And before I launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview, I would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design.
Paul Steinhardt, a physicist from New York, and Aranda/Lasch, architects, collaborated in an installation in London at the Serpentine.
New sensing elements on the body -- you can grow hairs on your nails, and therefore grab some of the particles from another person.
The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint.
Instead, this element here is much more banal.
In this particular case a section will be devoted to information design.
Another aspect of contemporary design that I think is mind-opening, promising and will really be the future of design, is the idea of collective design.
This is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa, you have a massage, you have a facial, maybe a rub, and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature, and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time.
Techniques became better -- not only carving but also stereolithography and laser -- solidifying all kinds of resins, whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger, to the point that now we can have actual chairs made by rapid manufacturing.
They had a particular shape that they had to stay in.
And so this student at the RCA designed this beautiful blown-glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies, in this case, pregnancy.
We always think that robots will take care of us, and instead they designed these robots that are very, very needy.
So it's just this idea of what we really miss in life.
These three objects over there are hard drives with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality very, very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away.
And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project.
All this noise around us actually has information.
That database contained the timing of attacks, the location, the size and the weapons used.
We did this exact same thing for Iraq.
So we looked at a few more conflicts.
And we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines, but the slope of these lines, they clustered around this value of alpha equals 2.5.
Alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks, which is really the distribution of the group strength carrying out the attacks.
Now what I believe is going on is that the insurgent forces, they evolve over time. They adapt.
This is what wars look like when they continue.
And the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards to a fragmented state.
And this tells me one of two things.
I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.
And again, within Judaism, we have a teaching about God, who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.
And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.
And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation, which says that when God created the world, God thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice.
If you put boiling water in, it will shatter.
The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living, what should we be doing, social justice.
And that unity is something that connects all of creation.
And they say "It's 18 minutes."
And, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.
"Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed.
He rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."
The rabbi came in and saw what was going on.
And God," he said to the poor man, "is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give."
And it's from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning, that pain is a disease.
A very different feeling.
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals, she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.
But the worst part was, not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day.
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that.
That's crazy, but that's, in fact, what happens with chronic pain.
And most importantly, what we do is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life.
I want to talk to you about something kind of big.
We all live here in Boulder.
It was huge. To give you a sense of the scale, okay, there you go. The scale here is 50 miles on top, a hundred kilometers on the bottom. This thing was 300 kilometers across -- 200 miles -- an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet, threw up enough dust to block out the sun.
Now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in.
The object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across, so roughly the size of Mackey Auditorium here.
And again, this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we're sitting in.
But if it came over a city, an important city -- not that any city is more important than others, but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis -- that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization.
It's right here.
The National Science Foundation, other countries are very interested in doing this.
Now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go-around are one in a million, roughly -- very, very low odds, so I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all.
In the year 2005, NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact, which slammed into -- slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet.
That means we can do it again.
Well, my opinion is, fine. Okay?
It doesn't have to be huge -- couple of tons, not that big -- and you park it near the asteroid.
We have astronomers in place with telescopes looking for them. We have smart people, very, very smart people, who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem, and we have the technology to do this.
Spock.

Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries.
So I can go back to my story.
At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem, which was, you know, survival below one side, but what was really painful for me was, remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart.
He was running a media systems organization which is still in business, the gentleman is still in business.
And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times.
And I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it.
It's business anywhere.
And second, that I have no idea how to make it work.
So I thought, why don't we get into that business?
They want to -- the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press.
It's not a bank. We had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them -- by establishing management systems, by providing all that knowledge, how do you run a business on one side -- while they all know how to run, how to create content.
We finance anything that a media company would need, from printing presses to transmitters.
I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.
I will not run, but it's very important for me who is going to succeed me.
So what the governor got was an empty shell.
That is not too much, is it?
And it's called fundraising.
If there are investors willing to finance U.S. government budget deficit, why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit?
You do it, you start it in the States, because it's, you know, concepts are very, very close to American minds.
It says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.
But I'm going see what happens if I press this button.
It's fairly dramatic, actually, to have this happen.
Now, yeah, what do we mean by beautiful? That's one thing.
Would they really have different laws?
Here's what I was saying about the laws. They're really there.
There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff.
Now, it's often said that getting closer and closer to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies, and then higher energies, and then higher energies, or short distances, and then shorter distances, and then still shorter distances, and so on, is like peeling the skin of an onion.
And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin.
There are lots of more sophisticated examples.
There's a new notation in the 19th century that expressed this, and if you use that notation, the equations get a lot simpler.
The last two, the first equation says that electric charges and currents give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields.
Mathematics very similar, but there was a whole new symmetry.
Symmetry exhibits the simplicity.
That was a big unification for those days, although today we take it for granted.
They are properties of the fundamental law.
Life can emerge from physics and chemistry, plus a lot of accidents.
Thank you very much.
He had a huge ambition.
How true for Lincoln.
Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.
And his great friend Speed went to his side and said, "Lincoln, you must rally or you will die."
They said, "Why are you doing this, Lincoln?"
These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.
He said, "If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act.
Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'" He was stunned.
The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life, when I helped him on his memoirs, was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work, power and individual success, that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone.
And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.
But they were great, nonetheless.
And then he said, "You remind me of my mother."
He had servants to answer any whim, and he had a family who loved him deeply.
So deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare, that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater, even during those dark days of the war.
One of his favorite stories, for example, had to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.
So you can imagine, if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting -- and he had hundreds of these stories -- you would have to relax.
Because at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out, "The Dodgers won!" or, "The Dodgers lost!"
He said, "Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall.
And then came my second sin.
"Oh yes," I said.
Allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families, and the public figures we have respected in our history, just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe, really can live on, so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives.
It's made of clay, and it's been fashioned into a cylinder shape, covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun.
Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem and captured the people and taken the Jews back to Babylon.
It is, of course, a great moment in the history of the Jewish people.
This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we've got.
This is the decree, this object is the evidence for the fact that the Jews, after the exile in Babylon, the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon, weeping when they remembered Jerusalem, those Jews were allowed to go home.
As you all know, that return from exile, the second temple, reshaped Judaism.
Much more important, it was the first multicultural, multifaith state on a huge scale.
The Greek invasions ended that.
After Alexander, the other empires, Babylon declines, falls into ruins, and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon.
Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account differ in one key respect.
It can only be Jehovah.
And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk.
The state of Israel is setup, and 50 years later, in the late 60s, it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over.
And it becomes critical for the Iranians to remember their great past, their great past when they fought Iraq and won.
This is the other side of that same picture.
This is heady national rhetoric, and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return.
In New York this autumn, it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place.
Across Europe and Central Asia, approximately one million children live in large residential institutions, usually known as orphanages.
They are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness.
Housing 550 babies, this was Ceausescu's show orphanage, and so I'd been told the conditions were much better.
Hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program.
Most of these children will never leave the institution again.
The institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home.
Across Europe, a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community-based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential. When I first started to work in Romania nearly 20 years ago, there were 200,000 children living in institutions, and more entering every day.
Together, this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime.
In fact, I have got qualifications.
Maybe there's a little change I can get involved in.
So I was thinking about peace, and then I was thinking, well where's the starting point for peace?
And we started writing letters to everybody.
And that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of September as the date of peace.
I'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace."
There were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family.
And here you see people like Mary Robinson, I went to see in Geneva.
And then we were listening to the people. We were documenting everywhere.
I felt that I was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day.
I don't know how to get involved in that process.
And suddenly, we started to institutionalize this day.
And we have to make this day work.
And that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways, because it couldn't not work.
We started moving around the corridors of the U.N. system, governments and NGOs, trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it, see if we could make it possible.
Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there'd be more -- when we got into certain areas, maybe there would be more people interested.
It would help and bring attention.
You can't just expect it to work. You have to get out and work."
And I got home, and I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the Taliban.
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back.
They were saying they would stop.
We have to go for a global truce.
And obviously the life-saving is increased, the concepts help.
And ultimately, we have to try that.
He said, "It's absolutely possible."
And there's a wonderful man sitting in this audience, and I don't know where he is, who said to me a few days ago -- because I did a little rehearsal -- and he said, "I've been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with 365 squares, and one of them is white."
Why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us?
So this is a first indication that the "all brains are made the same way" scenario is not quite right.
So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body.
And this is where the story started to bother me.
I've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number, and I could never find it.
But primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger, which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain.
I don't think it looks like us.
His brain, like ours, was made in the image of other primate brains.
Last question, then: how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons, and in particular, if great apes are larger than we are, why don't they have a larger brain than we do, with more neurons?
When you eat like a primate, you can't afford both.
And remarkably, that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago, when they invented cooking.
What is it that we have that no other animal has?
I call myself a body architect.
I started a collaboration with a friend of mine, Bart Hess -- he doesn't normally look like this -- and we used ourselves as models.
I'm fascinated with the idea of what happens when you merge biology with technology, and I remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram biology, in the future, away from disease and aging.
But when I look towards the future, the next project is completely unknown and wide open.
My job is to make arms and legs -- well it's not completely true.
I was also working in the orthopedic center, we call it.
So the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority.
I was coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions.
Well I'm not a particularly brave person, I have to confess it, but I could not just ignore him.
Why don't you have the artificial legs?"
So I hoped that he would not come.
And they were not alone.
It's not a priority."
Also one of the physical therapists reported that Mahmoud could be provided with a leg, but not immediately.
He was telling me, "Patients are coming."
But finally, the great day arrived.
Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting.
I can run, and now you can go to school.
He was in good shape -- a bit thinner.
He said, "You have taught me to walk.
Just to give him some money.
"What?" I said, "Stop."
That's a production line and a very fast one.
"It's a trick, it's a trick," I said.
He has regained his full dignity thanks to that job.
They are 7,000 every year -- people coming for the first time.
And when you start changing, you cannot stop.
They are my teachers.
We have several teams in the main part of Afghanistan.
And you should see me during the match.
And it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent.
Thankfully, baby was out -- mother and child survived.
And so three months later, just before she returned to the United States, nurses in Accra go on strike.
We've heard a lot about that.
And they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment.
Because of his uniform they speak to him differently, and they explain to him that they're just following orders.
It was a breath of fresh air.
But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore.
And by the way, it's continued to.
I became a parent.
This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in.
Very little emphasis on ethics, and the typical graduate from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility.
I think it would make a huge difference.
It's such a simple statement.
Now, we cannot achieve perfection, but if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence.
I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of Student Government.
And every single one of them has been placed.
I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent.
Can you see it?
And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire: You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm, but not so close that you're too toasty and you get burned.
They also cause the light from the star to vary.
Kepler won't find a planet around every single star it looks at.
Now, how do we go about that sort of thing?
Wrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you.
I haven't had a good look. Well, it's not that great a convenience.
Now that I've done that -- I'll explain it in a moment -- I must tell you that I am an actor.
They claim to be psychics, or sensitives, whatever they can.
Now, I have two questions I would like to ask these people if I had the opportunity to do so.
Now, she could easily have said, "Oh, it's in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia," but she doesn't say that. No, she doesn't.
And they take advantage of the innocent, the naive, the grieving, the needy people out there.
You stop breathing, and then you're dead.
Now, folks often ask us at the James Randi Educational Foundation, they call me, they say, "Why are you so concerned about this, Mr. Randi?
Sylvia Browne -- thank you -- Sylvia Browne is the big operator in this field at this very moment.
Because, the bottom line is, the sponsors love it, and he will expose her to television publicity all the time.
He isn't worth bringing back, obviously.
Sylvia Browne is an exception in that she's the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge.
All the more reason to take the million dollars, wouldn't you think, Sylvia?
It's an alternative form of healing, right?
The answer may surprise you.
Now wait a minute, we heard about a guy in Florida.
Maybe these people are just independently wealthy.
We've seen people, even today, speaking to us about AIDS epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with.
I'm willing to take your suggestions, and I'm willing to have you tune in to our webpage.
We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it.
And one of the major gaps in care, almost across the board, is access to safe surgery.
And when it does, it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities, can fix it, can source the parts and keep it saving lives.
Those machines go the proverbial junkyard.
It's not just inappropriate, it becomes really unsafe.
And now in the middle of this surgery, the surgeon is racing against the clock to finish his case, which he can do -- he's got a headlamp.
And after umpteen surgeries and, you can imagine, really unspeakable tragedy, he just said, "That's it. I'm done. That's enough.
When you have electricity, everything in this machine begins in the base.
Now if you don't have power, or, God forbid, the power cuts out in the middle of surgery, this machine transitions automatically, without even having to touch it, to drawing in room air from this inlet.
And so we've just added this manual bellows.
And so it's not going to break very easily, but if it does, virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver.
So we're thrilled.
I think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health.
And I called it the Zimbabwe Institute of Vigital Arts.
The Akan of people of Ghana and [Cote d'Ivoire] developed Adinkra symbols some 400 years ago, and these are proverbs, historical sayings, objects, animals, plants, and my favorite Adinkra system is the first one at the top on the left.
Ethiopia has had the longest tradition of writing, with the Ethiopic script that was developed in the fourth century A.D.
Africa has had a long tradition of design, a well-defined design sensibility, but the problem in Africa has been that, especially today, designers in Africa struggle with all forms of design because they are more apt to look outward for influence and inspiration.
The last word goes to the great Jamaican leader Marcus Mosiah Garvey and the Akan people of Ghana with their Adinkra symbol Sankofa, which encourages us to go to the past so as to inform our present and build on a future for us and our children.
But I still think that this -- -- may be this year's version of this.
Then hear this, please.
There's another piece of the puzzle, which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday, and one you already know.
We were told, we were assured, that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate, the healthier we'd be.
What do they have in common?
Yet they do that.
So, instead of substituting plants for animals, our swollen appetites simply became larger, and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.
That's just the United States.
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.
There was no snack food, and until the '20s, until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.
There was no marketing. There were no national brands.
It's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.
Thus arrived convenience.
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.
Listen to this, between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.
For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally, as if it were plastic, food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.
Think of the frozen chicken nugget.
So, now we clamor for organic food.
This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth, 30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we'll eat.
Isn't meat eating essential to health?
During that time, I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything.
We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well, and we can eat even better.
I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third.
So why was I stalling?
I've been doing it for the last year, and it's great.
The program has been great, weekday veg.
[Beautiful] [Intriguing] So you don't have to say a lot.
So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names, although, again, sometimes it does make mistakes.
Well, then, because of electronic tattoos, maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality, because these tattoos will live far longer than our bodies will.
So he's walking out and walking out and walking out and he just can't resist. He looks at her, loses her forever.
She kept getting distracted. He eventually won the race.
Thank you.
So the annual death rate adds up to 150,000 -- sorry, the daily death rate -- 150,000 people per day, which is a huge number by any standard.
So that would be, roughly, 324 people have died since I've begun speaking.
Library of Congress holds 18 million volumes.
Well, let's first look at the probability -- and this is very, very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years, which is surprising.
Everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees.
And even if you just look at the current people, and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct, it should still have a high priority.
You just want to cling onto this.
We were very successful.
And this is the answer -- we would have to change.
It's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use.
Looking ahead, there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later.
But part of the reason -- and that's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these -- is that they're also intrinsically valuable.
Imagine a species that just didn't have this neural machinery for processing music.
Conscientiousness and sympathy.
This is the last picture that I want to -- now we've got to use the laser pointer.
Well, we know already that in this little human circle there, there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being -- human life at its best is wonderful.
I had the question popped into my head: What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like if you could connect the two spheres?
So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support that.
So there's this huge invisible shape structures that magnetism takes in the universe.
TS: The first one I did was in the late 70's, and I just had a simple cone with a spigot at the bottom of it.
I want to just say -- so this is Jack, Nick and Louie.
And I keep it around for a couple of weeks, and I'm contemplating it, and I'll do another session with it and bring it up to another level, where all of this becomes the background, the depth of it.
You've got gravity, you've got the centrifugal force, you've got the fluid dynamics.
Like the occurrence of moire patterns.
And I love the shapes that I see in scientific observations and apparatus, especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it, the scale, is very interesting to me.
JH: Oh, let's hope so. Oh, my God, let's.
In my case, my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also.
And I think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature, humans are of the universe.
I'm five years old, and I am very proud.
Thanks to Chernobyl, we get asylum in the U.S.
About a year later, I get to feel that way again when we find a bag full of stuffed animals in the trash, and suddenly I have more toys than I've ever had in my whole life.
It doesn't hit me until years later just how little we had.
This was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams.
I'm a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background.
He can read a novel or two a day.
And I was struck by going to so many, one after the other, with some clarity of what it was that I was longing for.
One of them, I call my Mimaw's Test.
I'm just going to make the whole thing myself.
And I'm going to create this in two years, and I have.
So now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you.
This piece was great. This is in my parents' backyard in Arkansas.
The sun rises, and it melts away.
And all these works, in some way, talk about luck or fate or chance.
And he shows up on their porch, their doorstep, with a toothbrush and pajamas, and he's ready to spend the week with them.
This project is called "Love Nests."
And she was thinking about her friends and family who work in chaos-ridden places and developing countries, and she was thinking, what can I make that would be of value to them, in case something bad happens and they have to buy their way across the border or pay off a gunman?
This is by a duo, Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland.
And so we got to the grave and made this, which was hilarious -- the attention that we got.
And this piece: those aren't actually leaves.
So he makes these interesting conversations about realism and mimicry and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage.
This is one of their founders, Gert Schaeffer.
The next artist is K. M. Yoon, a really interesting South Korean artist.
This is from a short film of hers called "The Last Person."
Next is by Hilda Singh, and she's doing a whole project called "Social Outfits."
And after this one, there's 77 other artists.
Most people think they know what origami is. It's this: flapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.
So this art has been around for hundreds of years, and you would think something that's been around that long -- so restrictive, folding only -- everything that could be done has been done a long time ago.
You can get horns, antlers -- even, if you look close, cloven hooves.
The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure.
So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami.
Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars on a flag, with 13 stripes.
And yeah, you really can.
The last step is not so hard, but that middle step -- going from the abstract description to the folded shape -- that's hard.
What paper went into that flap?
There's other ways of making flaps.
I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements.
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.
We found we could do insects, spiders, which are close, things with legs, things with legs and wings, things with legs and antennae.
You can make multiple subjects.
But I want to show you some examples.
And he used it to design this solar array.
The design called for geosynchronous orbit 25,000 miles up, 100-meter diameter lens.
Folded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures.
Japan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail, and you can see here that the sail expands out, and you can still see the fold lines.
So they need to figure out how, in a computer, to flatten an airbag.
The thing is, that this often happens in math and science.
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada.
To combine engineering and design and ...
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.
Women, for the first time this year, became the majority of the American workforce.
If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots, you can see the evidence everywhere.
And this is why I like to talk about this, because if we don't acknowledge it, then the transition will be pretty painful.
These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.
But in fact, they found something very surprising.
It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage jobs -- and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs, and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.
So what's that about?
What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills.
And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect.
People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college, to community college, say, and retool themselves, learn a new set of skills?
And some people say it's because, in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.
Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely.
And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don't reverse themselves without a lot of pain, and that's why I talk about us all going through this together.
So who's the man now?" he asked them.
And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.
How much do you prefer a first-born son?
And then on the female side, you have the opposite, in which you have these crazy superhero women.
And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.
And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you.
Now, as it turns out, I'm a neuroscientist, so I knew that the memory of that person and the awful, emotional undertones that color in that memory, are largely mediated by separate brain systems.
Xu Liu: Test mice.
But memory is not.
SR: So the same way that building lights at night let you know that somebody's probably working there at any given moment, in a very real sense, there are biological sensors within a cell that are turned on only when that cell was just working.
It shouldn't take minutes or hours to work.
XL: Oh. That's true. So it looks like, hmm, indeed we need to find a better way to impact the brain at the speed of light.
You can think of channelrhodopsin as a sort of light-sensitive switch that can be artificially installed in brain cells so that now we can use that switch to activate or inactivate the brain cell simply by clicking it, and in this case we click it on with pulses of light.
Whenever a mouse is in fear, it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box, trying to not move any part of its body, and this posture is called freezing.
SR: All right, and here's the million-dollar experiment.
It stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body.
And then we published our findings in the journal Nature.
So we reasoned that now that we can reactivate a memory, what if we do so but then begin to tinker with that memory?
Rather than finding a fear memory in the brain, we can start by taking our animals, and let's say we put them in a blue box like this blue box here and we find the brain cells that represent that blue box and we trick them to respond to pulses of light exactly like we had said before.
So it formed a false memory, because it's falsely fearing an environment where, technically speaking, nothing bad actually happened to it.
That's exactly what I mean about editing these kinds of processes.
And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them -- how few of them could even resemble a normal, contented, satisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security was destroyed by the war.
And this seemed very interesting to me.
In fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources, material resources, contributes to unhappiness, but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness.
And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.
He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks, and as he does that, he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination.
He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.
And because all of these people I started interviewing -- this was an interview which is over 30 years old -- so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the "flow experience."
You don't think; it goes automatically, if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.
I couldn't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace.
So for each person we can establish an average, which is the center of the diagram.
Control is also a good place to be, because there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.
Even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow, but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it.
Except, I've never lived one day of my life there.
then I'm very much of the United States, and I have been for 48 years now, since I was a really small child.
And their whole life will be spent taking pieces of many different places and putting them together into a stained glass whole.
Of course, if anybody asked me then, "Where is your home?"
Already, we represent the fifth-largest nation on Earth.
But for the fortunate among us, I think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities.
Where you come from now is much less important than where you're going.
"Really?" I said. I'm always a bit skeptical when people say things like that.
He found himself.
Small but eminently comfortable, it had a bed and a rocking chair and a long desk and even longer picture windows looking out on a small, private, walled garden, and then 1,200 feet of golden pampas grass running down to the sea.
I just took walks along the monastery road and sent postcards to loved ones.
And it's only by stepping out of your life and the world that you can see what you most deeply care about and find a home.
And what I've found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways.
Making a switch.
And so sometime soon, you'll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way.
There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world.
But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it.
And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, you know, and they have become emerging economies, we call them.
But there is a continuous world from walking, biking, driving, flying -- there are people on all levels, and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle.
And if, but only if, we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change, and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here.
There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen -- that can stop this [growth] from happening.
That's India and this is China. Size is population.
Look, Bangladesh catching up with India.
Child survival is the new green.
And look at the position of the old West.
What you learn when you go to Australia is the Australians are very competitive.
And of course they said this was because of their fine moral standing, their exercise, because they're Australians and we're weedy pommies, and so on.
But this graph is after taking into account all of these known risk factors.
I distinctly -- nobody forgets cod liver oil.
Anyway, I came back from Australia, and despite the obvious risks to my health, I moved to Aberdeen.
And here's this incredibly simple molecule, a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together, and yet these are hugely important for [unclear] our low blood pressure, for neurotransmission, for many, many things, but particularly cardiovascular health.
We thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death, and how cells survive, and their resistance to other things.
We put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it, we injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide.
So we used ultraviolet A, which doesn't make vitamin D.
One of the subjects here was my mother-in-law, and clearly I do not know her age.
So what we've next done is we've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation.
Different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that.
In summer, you might as well be at the equator.
We suspect a lot of these come from diet, green leafy vegetables, beetroot, lettuce has a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin.
This is actually a painting that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School.
While, at the same time, the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat.
Every 30 seconds a patient dies from diseases that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement.
Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate.
Your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day.
One of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials.
We used that biomaterial in the middle.
The strategy here, is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ, you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ, less than half the size of a postage stamp, you can then tease that tissue apart, and look at its basic components, the patient's own cells, you take those cells out, grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities, and then we then use scaffold materials.
We want to make sure that we condition this muscle, so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient.
A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types.
This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain.
We then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components, muscle, and these bladder specialized cells.
The material is actually being coated with the cells.
And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy.
And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold.
This is actually your typical desktop printer.
Two weeks later, we basically can lift this organ up, it feels like a liver, we can hold it like a liver, it looks like a liver, but it has no cells.
We perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient's own liver cells.
Again, small structures, our challenge is how to make them larger, and that is something we're working on right now at the institute.
If you present with a diseased pancreas we'd like to take cells from that organ.
And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago, stem cells from the amniotic fluid, and the placenta, which have those properties.
And there you see the stagecoach driver, and he goes, on the top panel, He goes A, B, C, D, E, F.
I'm going to show you now, a very short clip, It's a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs.
And now I can just go and go out with my friends, go do whatever I want.
We get told that we need to study harder or be more focused or get a tutor.
Unfortunately the school system is grooming this world to say, "Hey, let's be a lawyer or let's be a doctor," and we're missing that opportunity because no one ever says, "Hey, be an entrepreneur."
We could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts.
Everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneurs and say that we're bad people.
I have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.
And what we're doing is we're giving them Ritalin and saying, "Don't be an entrepreneurial type.
I'm also quoted -- and I told the person who wrote the textbook -- I'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every Canadian university and college studies.
It just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut.
And my mom came into the room and she said, "Where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners?"
And I learned that you could actually negotiate with people.
And he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me ever.
If I couldn't sell all four, I could at least get one.
So that's obvious, right.
So I would go and collect for all the papers.
Remember at 10 years old -- so 34 years ago I saw opportunity in this stuff.
And you'd make these chairs.
So I learned that lesson at a young age.
But I realized that there was this one hill on our golf course, the 13th hole that had this huge hill.
And they'd give me their orders for the following week.
You just pick them up with both feet.
And then I'd sell 50 at a time of all the crappy ones.
Then I paid my entire way through first year university at Carlton by selling wine skins door to door.
He said, "I work too damn hard for my money. I'm not going to see you ever waste a penny."
Or I'll come to them and say, "Here's what I need done."
They walk up with me. Every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker.
My kids do that all the time.
And say, "These ones are good ones."
My kids love this stuff.
We wouldn't have have that stuff, right?
It's about kids. It's about entrepreneurship.
Given this rare opportunity to start fresh, they chose liberal arts as the most compelling model because of its historic commitment to furthering its students' broadest intellectual, and deepest ethical potential.
But the price of its dominance is enormous.
What kind of a world should we be making?
Simply put, when the impulse is to change the world, the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness than to create a sense of empowerment.
Our public education, once a model for the world, has become most noteworthy for its failures.
You can be sure Jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said, "If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects what never was, and never will be."
When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.
You are not the first to try to figure this out, just as you are unlikely to be the last.
And when making connections is of the essence, the power of technology emerges with special intensity.
This discovery is transforming.
The words on the card describe what will happen inside.
We actually do it all the time.
Well, you have two things.
You're thinking, "That's not what the Internets say."
Finally, truth will be brought here.
I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church.
And not only food, right.
Right, it was the first great Republican president of the 20th century who taught us about environmental thinking -- Teddy Roosevelt.
He's a terrible producer of videos, but it's great content, so I'm going to give you a little bit of it.
And then, of course, people from San Fransisco saw it.
LL: Or ...
But there's also a dialogue between the videos, where, once the basic structure is established, it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups' social and physical worlds.
Now, my concern is, we Dems, too often, not so much.
This is the mastermind behind the eventual passage of what we call the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, extending the term of existing copyrights by 20 years, so that no one could do to Disney what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm.
The mashup is owned by Lucas.
Even for the head of Goldman Sachs, at least in part.
And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses, as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there, licensed freely in this way.
I answered, "No." I didn't even think about it.
"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.
Now, that was the story of me then, my good old days of right-wing lunacy.
It's a value of the limits in regulation.
I remember one day my best friend Brian was working on a project.
And I see that opting out that happens in childhood, and it moves in and becomes more ingrained, even by the time you get to adult life.
That you don't do things, you're afraid you're going to be judged.
In four hours he had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias.
And he'd get them comfortable with that.
They tried harder, they persevered longer, and they were more resilient in the face of failure.
And they're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person.
And Doug was really disappointed to learn that nearly 80 percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with his MRI machine.
He turned it into an adventure for the kids.
So the quantitative results were great.
I was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival.
And so there were lots of projects that I could work on.
Everybody has a change-the-world thing.
As we design these things, we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds, and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems.
I think we're doing it right now, but we're doing it unconsciously.
You'll see broad bacterial groups, and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe, it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.
We know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air.
And that is exactly what we found.
He went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health.
Contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers.
Thank you.
We don't work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth.
So this was before the computer was invented.
And in a premonition of today's world of cloud computing and softwares of service, his system was called NLS for oN-Line System.
So this is Doug Engelbart.
The magazines started to cover it.
So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November 1990.
In the next couple of years, the hypertext community didn't recognize him either.
On the other hand, there's Marc Andreessen who wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web.
And that creates the front page. It's always rising, falling, always changing.
But to really kind of personify the movement, they wanted to name it.
We changed our logo, for the day, from the alien to a Splashy, to sort of help the cause.
Facebook groups were getting created. Facebook applications were getting created.
And I think that's what helped drive this.
And this is kind of how the Internet works.
It's okay to take yourself a little less seriously, given that, even though it's a very serious cause, you could ultimately achieve your final goal.
I was born in a little village called Gando.
I had luck. I was lucky, because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that.
But how do you do it when you're still a student and you don't have money?
So I had to convince everybody.
This is the school, built with the community.
It has opened up opportunities to do more projects in Gando.
And we kept building, and that is the result.
we start cutting them, and then we place them on top of the roof before we pour the concrete, and you have this result.
They will do it themselves.
We just wait for the rain to go.
Yes, you know it.
As a seven-year-old guy, I was impressed.
You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass.
And let's put it back into the deck, somewhere in the middle, and let's get started.
MT: So over here is low tide, and over here is high tide, and in the middle is the moon.
Voice: Don't tell, or it won't come true.
I'm performing for you.
Voice: Why not? That's a very good hand.
The world is changing with really remarkable speed.
First of all, it's a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people, which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year.
It will remain in very fundamental respects very different.
And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China.
You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing, even though we think this to be the case.
China, over the same time period, went in exactly the opposite direction, very painfully holding this huge civilization, civilization-state, together.
We were wrong. Why were we wrong?
So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong -- as it will be to the question of Taiwan -- was a natural response: one civilization, many systems.
Well the reason, I think, essentially is, again, back to the civilization-state.
Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least -- that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy.
The result, by the way, is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.
But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.
and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
And secondly, it's ignorant.
I mean, take the question of East Asia.
First, the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world.
Well, maybe that's true, maybe that's an exaggeration.
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together.
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it.
Or, look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368.
a button, two guitar picks and lots of hot glue.
Little did I know what a huge impact it would have on me one night when I was at a party and I heard a sound coming out of a record player in the corner of a room.
So I picked up my banjo and I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them.
Go get it, girl.
And then they come up to me after the show and they all have a story.
"Big sister Wong, can I sing you a song that my mom sang for me before she was swallowed in the earthquake?"
Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris, and the phone rang and I heard, "Hey, JR, you won the TED Prize 2011.
I can't do anything to save the world."
I was doing graffiti -- writing my name everywhere, using the city as a canvas.
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people.
A large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of Paris.
So I went back there with a 28 mm lens.
That's where I realized the power of paper and glue.
Not a smile -- that really doesn't tell about who you are and what you feel.
I love the way that people will ask me, "How big will my photo be?"
We're in Ramallah right now.
And most of them couldn't say.
In the Middle East, I experienced my work in places without [many] museums.
I just took their pictures and pasted them.
So I decided to go there.
The day after, I came back and they were already scratched.
I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.
What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.
We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Kenya.
Some who understood the project would explain it to others.
This is Kibera, Kenya, one of the largest slums of Africa.
When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke, "Now God can see me."
So people would come to us and ask us, "Hey, what are you up to?"
Okay.
But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.
And that is for me one of the more important things in the work.
The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community.
And today, they are with you in Long Beach.
Art can change the way we see the world.
And this starts right now.
So I hope that, together, we'll create something that the world will remember.
We've shared transportation.
Also, there's been this recent distrust of big brands, global big brands, in a bunch of different industries, and that's created an opening.
And third is that physical things are readable on a map -- so restaurants, a variety of venues, but also with GPS and other technology like RFID and it continues to expand beyond that, we can also track things that are moving, like a car, a taxicab, a transit system, a box that's moving through time and space.
I think we can do that in Cambridge," brought it to Cambridge and they started -- two women -- Robin Chase being the other person who started it.
They targeted to universities.
And you're going to the mountains to ski, you get different accessories put on the car for doing that sort of thing.
I was imagining it was like 20 percent when I first started.
Zipcar started a decade earlier, in 2000.
And I think we're going there anyway.
In general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur, I look at things as platforms.
Now we're saying that there's other options as well.
The areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement.
So this is an example.
The infrastructure enables that.
We're at the very beginning of something that, what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward, is inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early.
And it's clearly in the area of finance.
Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years.
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else.
Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine.
We can develop any part of the body.
So the big question for us is, "How do we manage this technological change?"
The war on talent, the need to attract people at all skill ranges, to push us around in our wheelchairs, but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital.
It's going to require innovation.
We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized.
I think it was in my second grade that I was caught drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo.
I got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again.
She's a bit of a hippie.
But, to cut a long story short, I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist.
And, you know, just like how every cartoonist knows Bush here, and if you had to meet Bush, it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist's delight.
He said, "Oh, so am I."
What was, for me, a very naive observation, turned out to be a disaster.
I saw this dead, naked effigy of himself hanging from the ceiling.
You know, there are a hundred types of brushes.
Except, I even started painting dancers.
And then I was fortunate enough to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus.
They are ruthless, they are honest, but they're full of energy and fun.
And these guys paint humongous paintings, and they look really good.
Since I mentioned my wife, the most important collaboration has been with her, Netra.
My dad knows a bunch of rich guys.
That's us in New York.
And I said, "Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us, all the people who bought our work."
I love my mother and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die.
Of course, my work turned ugly, but another thing happened.
At this point, something else happened.
This time, not only did my collectors disappear, the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing.
And Rudra was born.
Everything about my work has become more whimsical.
So I said, okay.
And I drew it out for her.
Einstein: Einstein.
This morning we've heard a lot of whispers about Tom Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday. Einstein, did you hear whispers?
E: Oh, my God! My God! My God!
Now, Einstein also thinks, you know, working in caves and travelling through space -- it's all very dangerous jobs.
Can you get down?
Einstein, can you also sing?
SW: There you go. And what do pirates like to drink?
SW: And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee.
SW: Again.
E: Tweet, tweet, tweet.
SW: And a pig?
E: Stinker.
E: I love you.
Obviously, you see the resemblance.
So water was something that scared me to begin with.
My inability to swim has been one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments.
If I have an art, it's deconstructing things that really scare the living hell out of me.
My feet would slice through the water like razors, I wouldn't even move. I would leave demoralized, staring at my feet.
Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion.
And you can see that he's extending his right arm below his head and far in front.
And the entry point for his right hand -- notice this, he's not reaching in front and catching the water.
In freestyle, easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll, and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water.
Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan.
So, But I didn't say . I said, . Pretty close.
There had been something lost in translation.
Many of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters, to facilitate literacy -- some are required to.
I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation.
And so I ended up walking like this.
She comes up, and this was her approach, the teacher.
And she looked up and said, "Now that's better."
Now the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside, I found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities.
I want you to see part of what I practiced.
I couldn't develop the attributes in my toes, the strength in my feet, to do that.
So using my arch-nemesis, Spanish, no less, to learn tango.
When I imagine my life, what my life would have been like without the educational opportunities that I had, it makes me wonder.
It's an idea for a new kind of school, which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking about what schools are for and how they work.
And we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissance where work and learning are integrated.
We tried it out, first in Luton -- famous for its airport and not much else, I fear -- and in Blackpool -- famous for its beaches and leisure.
That's grown this year to about 10.
Other ones have a focus on health care, tourism, engineering and other fields.
Thank you very much.
You see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself, and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin.
Everybody focuses on the things that kill us, and that's what I was focusing on.
And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.
And somehow maybe the microbial community that's in and on me got off, and then this triggered some sort of immune response and led to me killing the cells that make insulin in my body.
Cleaned out all the microbes, and then put it in the recipient.
And a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system, helps in fighting off pathogens, helps in our metabolism, and determining our metabolic rate, probably determines our odor, and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways.
Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you.
And it turns out that many veterinarians, old school veterinarians in particular, have been doing something called "poo tea," not booty, but poo tea, to treat colic and other ailments in horses and cows and things like that, where you make tea from the poo from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal.
And we can now start to compare the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences.
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.
In 1962, Charles Van Doren, who was later a senior editor of Britannica, said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical -- it should stop being safe.
We're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide, poverty worldwide, empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions.
The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French -- all the Western European languages are quite big.
So the servers are managed by a rag-tag band of volunteers; all the editing is done by volunteers.
You could never afford to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day and do what we're doing at Wikipedia.
But when we've seen quality tests -- and there haven't been enough of these yet and I'm really encouraging people to do more, comparing Wikipedia to traditional things -- we win hands down.
And it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions.
And I said -- you know, I always say, please don't do that; that's not a good thing.
But we have this jargon term of neutrality, which has its own long history within the community, which basically says, any time there's a controversial issue, Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue.
That recent changes page was also fed into IRC channel, which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools.
So we do have edits by anonymous users, which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia.
Of course, it's my job to say that, but it's actually true.
All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages.
And in the particular example we have here, it's a film, "Twisted Issues," and the first person says, "Now this is supposedly a film. It fails the Google test miserably."
Now it is true that at the end of the day an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say, OK, 18 deletes, two keeps: we'll delete it.
People really want to know about, OK, administrators, things like that.
And I also like to say she's the only person who actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia, so ...
And we see they have a voting process, so we're going to send -- we have 40,000 members and we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted."
That's my job in the community: to say we won't allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content.
Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia.
And that's a much bigger project; it's going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition.
17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped, and we're just starting our third experiment: studying people who report that they're still in love after 10 to 25 years of marriage.
And every spring and autumn, exactly at the equinox, the sun rises behind his temple, and perfectly bathes her temple with his shadow.
They've never found a society that did not have it.
I've never had the opportunity to say it before.
I am told you will leave me here.
Our first study of people who were happily in love has been widely publicized, so I'm only going to say a very little about it.
Romantic love is an obsession. It possesses you.
So anyway, we found activity in three brain regions.
We found activity in other brain regions also -- in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses.
When you've been rejected in love, not only are you engulfed with feelings of romantic love, but you're feeling deep attachment to this individual.
It is a homeostatic imbalance.
And she -- not only did the instant craving come back, but she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry.
In fact, I think animal attraction can be instant -- you can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant.
We've put five people in so far, and indeed, we found exactly the same thing. They're not lying.
And we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background, the same general level of intelligence, the same general level of good looks, the same religious values.
About 600,000 people have taken it in 33 other countries.
Women tend to get intimacy differently than men do.
So my final statement is: love is in us.
If you think about it, the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times.
And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach.
In that process, I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow.
This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum, and see how my bow resembles them.
This is a bamboo bow, with 45-pound draw weights.
Did it strike you?
And in some parts of the world, they use tools, like sponges to hunt fish.
We try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water, since we're actually observing them physically in the water.
So what that means is, after 28 years, we are tracking three generations, including grandmothers and grandfathers.
Now, we do know some things about how sounds are used with certain behaviors.
Don't tell anyone. It's a secret.
Now, in the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose that interact socially with the spotted dolphins.
Now, it's important to remember that you're only hearing the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds, and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds, and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds.
Now, scientists have used keyboard interfaces to try to bridge the gap with species including chimpanzees and dolphins.
She's kind of teasing him and taunting him.
And that's the scarf whistle, which is also associated with a visual symbol.
You have to keep their attention.
We don't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles.
So I try to give her the scarf.
The computer can localize who requested the toy if there's a word match.
Now, will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally?

Anyway, this is a song about: we have all this, but what are we going to do with it?
And it's a made-up word.
Yves uses his body to steer the wing.
And I think the wing is open, the wing is open.
He is over the English Channel and underway.
And there were many, many others.
YR: It was about 20 years ago when I discovered free falling.
So I'm kind of curious, what's your top speed?
YR: That's really the goal, because if you put [in] steering, then you reinvent the airplane.
I don't do special physical training.
Just with the helmet, integral helmet, it's really no problem to breathe.
So just check before it's finished.
So that was one of those cases where you let the wings go, right?
I have also an audible altimeter.
I assume you have standards.
So it's really a play between these two approaches.
And then I stabilize, and according to my altitude, I continue on two or three engines.
That's exactly why I asked the question.
What's next for you? What's next for Jetman?
Thanks to the increasing technology, better technology, it will be safe.
I bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better.
Think how many discoveries they represent.
Or so we should hope.
So they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little.
All knowledge derives from the senses.
What's wrong with us?
The unseen resembles the seen.
"So you admit it's all interpretation.
Our connection to reality is never just perception.
And each year, she is magically compelled to return.
There is such a thing as a defect in a story.
It's equally testable.
And the tilt also explains the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year, and predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres.
The search for hard-to-vary explanations is the origin of all progress.
It's a fact that is, itself, unseen, yet impossible to vary. Thank you.
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.
And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem.
Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...
I have a global vision for vision.
And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.
The description read: "The suburban streets of Minto become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of Minto."
This Australian-Indian girl, she came out and started to dance on her front lawn, and her father peered out the window to see what all the noise and commotion was about, and he soon joined her.
Modern arts festivals were born in the rubble of World War II.
Companies like De La Guarda, which I produce, and Punchdrunk create these completely immersive experiences that put the audience at the center of the action, but the German performance company Rimini Protokoll takes this all to a whole new level.
Back to Back is an Australian company of people with intellectual disabilities. I saw their amazing show in New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal at rush hour.
What 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less than an artistic occupation of the city and a reclamation of the streets for the people."
The filmmaker Georges Méliès was first a magician.
Visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions: assumption, things are as we know them; presumption, things will behave as we expect; and context in reality, our knowledge of the world as we know it, such as scale.
Second doctor: We're gonna take this nice and easy, Jake.First doctor: Well, do you want to sit up? That's fine.
My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from Southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland.
I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet.
I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic.
Please enjoy.
You glaze over with it.
And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it.
These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice.
They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice.
And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zoo plankton feeding on all that life.
After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head.
I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, "I'm in trouble."
And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South.
They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body.
It doesn't work that way.
All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon.
And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth.
He scolded me out, and said, "This is why we're here.
She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice.
And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin.
And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me.
She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around.
What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display.
Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go.
I mean, for me, that would be the perfect superpower, actually kind of an evil way of approaching it.
Bring them out, check, and see how accurate you were.
Now, you've been watching me for about 30 seconds.
For me, I like to think of it very simple, like a surveillance system.
Now, for my job, I have to play with techniques to exploit this, to play with your attention as a limited resource.
Now, I mean, this sounds like a good theory, but I could talk for a long time and tell you lots of things, and they may be true, a portion of them, but I think it's better if I tried to show that to you here live.
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.
Apollo Robbins: Well, we'll find one for you.
AR: Money. All right, let's try that.
I was looking for his wallet and he gave me his phone number.
Grab my wrist, but squeeze, squeeze firm.
Joe, we're going to keep doing this till you catch it.
AR: Check your pocket. See if it's still there. Is it still there?
Hold your hands together. Put your other hand on top.
So -- -- that's rather strange. They have shots for that.
Is this? I have no idea. That's a shrimp.
What am I wearing?
And now we've got the digital revolution.
There was a media blackout in 2008, when there was post-election violence in Kenya.
And the idea of the software was to gather information from SMS, email and web, and put a map so that you could see what was happening where, and you could visualize that data.
We did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world.
The day-to-day frustrations of dealing with this can be, let's just say very annoying.
And also, when traveling within Africa, you've got different settings for different mobile providers.
What if we could have connectivity with less friction?
The software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play when we wondered how can we use the cloud to be more intelligent so that you can analyze the different networks, and whenever you switch on the backup, you pick on the fastest network, so we'll have multi-SIM capability so that you can put multiple SIMs, and if one network is faster, that's the one you hop on, and if the up time on that is not very good, then you hop onto the next one.
Our team has basically been mules carrying components from the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations with customs border agents.
And the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people.
The answer is?
Somebody or something has changed the rules about how our world works.
If you go on Google and you look for "innovation + creativity," you get 30 million hits. If you add the word "consultants," it doubles to 60 million.
What I'm trying to explain to you is, there are things which don't make sense to us.
He's absolutely right.
The speed is accelerating. That's not the only thing.
And then add to that, every time you tweet, over a third of your followers follow from a country which is not your own.
And he says, do you notice anything? And the water is whooshing down this pipe.
They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink so that it actually gets diluted out, and the color's gone.
Out here is the world. Now, what's happened to our pace of learning as the world has accelerated? Well, if you work for a corporation, you'll discover it's quite difficult to work on stuff which your boss doesn't approve of, isn't in the strategy, and anyway, you've got to go through your monthly meetings.
Entering their ears, what they hear is, "Do crazy things and then I'll fire you." Why? Because — Why? Because in the old world, okay, in the old world, over here, getting stuff wrong was unacceptable.
Well, free pizzas! You should be treated better than the people who succeed.
And you might remember, some of you, how the cars were back then, and it was a common problem of overheating.
Over time, the buildings got taller and bigger, our engineering even better, so that the mechanical systems were massive. They require a huge amount of energy.
What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.
Keep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today, this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different.
This last project is also of components.
They go to see Michelangelo's "David," and when they finally come face to face with the statue, they both freeze dead in their tracks.
People low on it like things that are familiar, that are safe and dependable.
What kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture, who seek a deeper understanding of the world, and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all?
And please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative.
And by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie "The Matrix."
What is morality and where does it come from?
What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines?
This Norman Rockwell painting is called "The Golden Rule," and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong, of course, as the foundation of so many religions.
The fourth foundation is authority/respect.
I believe these are the five best candidates for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind.
Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens.
In-group, authority, purity -- this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it."
Which shows that within any country, the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness.
But if you're conservative, that's not so attractive.
But then, given the way of the world, things change.
So it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues, where we're asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice.
And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on, cooperation shoots up.
But I'm particularly interested in religion, and the origin of religion, and in what it does to us and for us.
It took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups.
Traditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive, and restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don't fit in.
So as Edmund Burke said, "The restraints on men, as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights."
Two of them are Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.
But before you feel superior to George Bush, before you throw a stone, ask yourself, do you accept this?
But as we learned from Samantha Power, in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can't just go charging in, saying, "You're wrong, and I'm right."
So I think the point -- the point of my talk, and I think the point of TED -- is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better.
And so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations, because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for, and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for.
And of course, there's a range of places where you'd think those things would be really useful.
Another situation.
So you've got traditional things like pepper spray, O.C. spray up at the top there, or Tasers over here.
So you feel this massive heat, and you go, "I want to get out of the way."
The moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine, you can start shooting at people.
And one study that I found, a particularly interesting one, was actually in Queensland, because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly.
This is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report.
So it wasn't that Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on.
It was routinely being used in this period, and, of course, still is routinely used -- because there were no complaints about it, not within the context of this study anyway -- it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent, who were potentially violent, and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant.
So one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they might be used indiscriminately -- that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore.
They pumped the whole theater full of the gas.
They're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better.
They get used out in the real world, like in Texas, like this.
And it's all captured by the video camera running in the front of the police car.
Just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States, it happened in Canada as well.
But I'd remind you what I'm talking about, I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons.
In other words, your perfect non-lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse.
We use words like "grasp" metaphorically to also think about understanding things.
Apparently it can.
Where did you guys get those?
That's the experience of a clever ride.
Now the background is -- the guy who did this is a physicist.
You're makers of food; you're makers of shelter; you're makers of lots of different things, and partly what interests me today is you're makers of your own world, and particularly the role that technology has in your life.
They're a bit subversive in what they do.
But it was a sense of pride that we made things, that the world around us was made by us.
Andrew had moved to Detroit from Duluth, Minnesota.
But he also moved here to meet other people doing what he's doing.
They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it.
And when someone opens your mailbox, you get a notification, an alert message goes to your iPhone.
They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it.
We just had an issue on space exploration, DIY space exploration.
Well he did a little bit better than free.
So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.
And Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm, is not glamorous either.
And there is, of course, this glamour.
Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today, but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent, Celtic magic.
There was a tremendous amount of technical achievement associated with creating this Hollywood glamour.
Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.
What glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurb in the table of contents of New York magazine, which was telling us that glamour is back -- glamour is all about transcending the everyday.
She's not looking away from you exactly, but you have to mentally imagine her world.
And yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Mary will often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms.
The notion is that it's going to transport you, and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane, who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.
You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.
And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies, how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue.
This is what the real world of computers, lamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.
Part of the thing is that, in "Rear Window," the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?
And of course glass block has that sense of translucence.
The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace, the perfect diamond ring.
That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.
I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too.
National Socialism is all about glamour.
And here's Hedy Lamarr.
They looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine.
Me only existed in the trying.
I never had babies because heads cannot give birth.
I began to see my body like an iPad or a car.
If I was afraid, I went to more dangerous places.
I heard about women being molested in their beds, flogged in their burqas, left for dead in parking lots, acid burned in their kitchens.
But the more I talked about it, the more objectified and fragmented my body became.
There are thousands of these stories, and many of the women had holes in their bodies -- holes, fistula -- that were the violation of war -- holes in the fabric of their souls.
Cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection.
And when it rains hard rain, I scream and I run in circles.
And gratefully, it didn't.
And in the name of connectedness, she said, "Oh, it's the Gulf of Mexico."
It was my head that was bald -- and comfortable now without a hat.
It was the realization that I had come very close to dying -- in the same way that the Earth, our mother, is barely holding on, in the same way that 75 percent of the planet are hardly scraping by, in the same way that there is a recipe for survival.
It was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms.
So that's a problem in philosophy, but for today's purposes I'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind, and that I don't have to worry about this.
So to start with an illustration, you need almost no information, one snapshot of a stranger, to guess what this woman is thinking, or what this man is.
Some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job.
And this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults.
What? RS: Pirates really like cheese sandwiches.
This pirate is called Joshua.
RS: Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink.
Which sandwich is he going to take?
And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his, where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his, the three-year-old comes up with another explanation: He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it, because now it's dirty, on the ground.
So it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan to take Joshua's sandwich, since he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich.
And now what we've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts.
And I'm going to give that to you now.
So we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed in this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm?
People, though, disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame Grace should get in the accident case.
This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebody's skull, into a small region of their brain, and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region.
And we can use that same pulse, now applied to the RTPJ, to ask if we can change people's moral judgments.
This system takes a long time to develop, slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence.
I mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call.
The changes I showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain, but they're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make.
And the whole project of understanding how brains do the uniquely human things -- learn language and abstract concepts, and thinking about other people's thoughts -- that's brand new.
Why?
A world obsessed with speed, with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more into less and less time.
And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga.
And my wake-up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son, and I found that at the end of day, I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down -- you know, I'd be speed reading "The Cat In The Hat."
Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?"
You think of, you know, urbanization, consumerism, the workplace, technology.
And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation.
And, in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration, lie what a lot of people now refer to as the "International Slow Movement."
And in some ways, these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts, because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City, it's kind of like a philosophical declaration.
I was making my way, let's say, slowly to Oxford, and I went through a news agent, and I saw a magazine, a men's magazine, and it said on the front, "How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds."
Right across much of the world -- North America being a notable exception -- working hours have been coming down.
But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well, and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month, so that people can, you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down.
So wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same: that less is very often more, that slower is very often better. But that said, of course, it's not that easy to slow down, is it?
I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger, deeper questions.
But the new idea, the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement, is that there is such a thing as "good slow," too.
So all of that said, is it, I guess, is it possible?
I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.
And we'll go off and have a conversation on that.
And he said, "No, no, no, Daddy -- this is a card for being the best story reader in the world."
And it took six months to reroute it.
If you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof, peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced, come back and pay the five dollars admission.
And when there were complaints about budget, I said, "Well, it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money: reflections."
I was asked to do a building, and I was given all the artifacts of clothing and drawings.
Well, they said, "People won't understand, they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that."
And so, you know, it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously.
And the structures rise from the sand cliffs -- they're built in concrete and sandstones; the roofs are stainless steel -- they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself, pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other.
They said, "Let's rebuild the museum."
And all the galleries, as you move through them and so on, are below grade.
If it were to be anywhere in Washington, it would be an office building, a conference center, a place for negotiating peace and so on -- all of which the building is -- but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial, this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall.
And so it goes.
Twenty years ago, in a conference Richard and I were at together, I wrote a poem, which seems to me to still hold for me today.
I won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens.
We had no idea what key we were going to play in.
So it's hard to even describe what a funny note would be.
And at some point, Christian will introduce this note.
We'll all accept his ideas, or not.
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted.
ready, just play some time.
Watch. One, two, a one, two, three, four.
It is often said that we fear that which we do not know.
I hope to become a vet when I grow up so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs who wander around the streets of the village that I live near Gilgit, northern Pakistan.
Or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who I truly am inside?
But there are still over 650 million Indians, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nepalese, who remain washed up on the shores of poverty.
That was fantastic.
So, that's home really.
I study fish, also the bigger things, whales and dolphins.
So, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia.
High pressure builds over India.
They lay the eggs into fresh water.
It really does need fresh water.
But it really hasn't been studied very much.
When I first went to the Maldives, dead keen on diving, spent as much of my time as I could in and under the water.
But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year.
Average height, about that much above sea level.
There are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes, nothing like that.
Any hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you.
You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place.
It stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here.
It's pretty obvious, they're coming from India.
It's about five kilometers around, counting the dragonflies as I go, trying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees.
And there is a front between them, and the front moves.
So, I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow, I've tracked this one, I know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit, and that's okay, I know how they come here, but why do they come here?
Okay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are, the monsoon rains.
And they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south they come down through Karnataka, into Kerala.
They're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed.
They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here.
Lay their eggs, next generation, they come up, automatically carried to where the rain is falling.
And this crossing here, of the ocean, is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect.
Which is an area along the Amur River, which is up here.
So, now they don't stop here, or even down here.
This fellow is a very nice bird, this is the Pied cuckoo.
It's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy, unfortunately, one of these met an unfortunate end.
And every one of these birds that makes the crossing from India to East Africa eats insects, large insects, the size of dragonflies. Thank you very much.
In fact, here's some footage from about 1984.
Freestyle itself, we developed all these flat ground tricks as you saw, but there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding, where guys were taking it to the streets, and they were using that ollie, like I showed you? They were using it to get up onto stuff like bleachers and handrails and over stairwells and all kinds of cool stuff.
And I got to -- What drew me to skateboarding, the freedom was now restored, where I could just create things, because that's where the joy was for me, always, was creating new stuff.
Okay, look at that. It's a darkslide.
Just let the ledge do that, and it's easy, and the next thing you know, there's 20 more tricks based out of the variations.
It's so much fun to do. In fact, when I started doing them, I remember, because I got hurt. I had to get a knee surgery, right? So there were a couple of days where, actually a couple of weeks, where I couldn't skate at all.
Now, let me -- I told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks. Consider that content, in a sense.
But there's this other aspect of it for wheelies, so check this out. There's a few tricks, again, how environment changes the nature of your tricks.
No matter how good you are, right, you still gotta deal with — So you hit this wall, and when I hit it, the first thing you do is you fall forward, and I'm like, all right, all right.
What makes them great is the degree to which they use their skateboarding to individuate themselves.
It's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do, right?
Very similar communities, very similar.
Because it's not just the mind.
And he made this statement that was so profound to me.
So you've really reinvented yourself in the past from freestyle to street, and, I think it was about four years ago you officially retired. Is that it? What's next?
It's a real pleasure to be here.
Carl Norden was born in 1880.
He wears three-piece suits; and he has a very, very small, important mustache; and he is domineering and narcissistic and driven and has an extraordinary ego; and he works 16-hour days; and he has very strong feelings about alternating current; and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness; and he drinks lots of coffee; and he does his best work sitting in his mother's kitchen in Zurich for hours in complete silence with nothing but a slide rule.
And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device.
Now I cannot tell you how incredibly excited the U.S. military was by the news of the Norden bombsight.
He was simple the instrument of God's will.
And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane, it's escorted there by a series of armed guards.
And of course, in wartime, conditions aren't perfect.
But most of all, the Norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target.
Well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the 700-acre perimeter of the plant?
Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bombsights.
And their mission was to find and to destroy -- remember the Scud missile launchers, those surface-to-air missiles that the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis?
They could have destroyed this little thing right here from 25,000 ft.
And over the course of the last six years in Northwest Pakistan, the CIA has flown hundreds of drone missiles, and it's used those drones to kill 2,000 suspected Pakistani and Taliban militants.
I have not described to you a success story.
And that's the greatest irony of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight.
You can -- I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures that you see on screen that come from there.
And every kid, you know, as a teenager, has got his bedroom he retreats to -- but I wanted my door, I thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened, like on Star Trek.
I also think that more generally, the use of the Internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend.
Why do we as people want to do that?
And I think that if you really sit and think about it, virtual worlds, and where we're going with more and more computing technology, represent essentially the likely, really tactically possible version of space exploration.
The space itself is about 10 times the size of San Francisco, and it's about as densely built out.
So it's a really large world already, in terms of the amount of stuff that's there and that's very important.
Everything that we interact with, all the experiences that we have, is kind of us flowing through a sea of information and interacting with it in different ways.
So when you organize information using the symbols of our memory, using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives, you maximally both excite, stimulate, are able to remember, transfer and manipulate data.
That experience of like, shopping together, just as a simple example, is an example of how as social creatures we want to experience information in that way.
So let me stop there and bring John back, and maybe we can just have a longer conversation.
Those top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody, even if you mean well when you build them.
I just remember it was one of those examples of data-driven design.
And I remember that that was just so telling, you know, that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen.
And of course, the existence of an economy is another idea.
Respond, and then we'll get the rest of your question.
JH: And your question?
So, I think that culture will fine-tune, it will emerge, but we still have some years to wait while that happens, as you would naturally expect.
In terms of psychographic -- oh, men and women: men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life, so about 45 percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women.
A lot of them -- about 55,000 people so far -- are cash-flow positive: they're making money from what -- I mean, real-world money -- from what they're doing in Second Life, so it's a very build -- still a creative, building things, build-your-own-business type of an orientation. So, that's it.
JH: So you're on your fifth life at this point?
I guess, and you're asking, what do I think about that? How do I -- JH: What's your response to the people who would say, that's horrifying?
It puts challenges on us to rise to. We must be better than ourselves, in many ways.
And to show the place where meditators, like me, who began with being a molecular biologist in Pasteur Institute, and found their way to the mountains.
So now, we are going to speak of happiness.
Now, let's come to happiness or well-being.
But now, if it is something that is going to determine the quality of every instant of our life, then we better know what it is, have some clearer idea.
I used to be a fan of Bach. I used to play it on the guitar, you know.
And happiness, of course, is such a vague word, so let's say well-being.
When you are surfing on the top, you are all elated.
We think that if we could gather this and that, all the conditions, something that we say, "Everything to be happy -- to have everything to be happy."
So one evening, he said, "Look, you are doing all these things, but isn't it nice, also, to build something within?"
There are some which are adverse to this well-being.
Aren't those negative emotions, or destructive emotions, inherent to the nature of mind?
We know we're not always angry, always jealous, always generous.
A kind of sense of inner freedom as opposite to intense grasping and obsession.
It looks very menacing, like a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm.
It means familiarization with a new way of being, new way of perceiving things, which is more in adequation with reality, with interdependence, with the stream and continuous transformation, which our being and our consciousness is.
They do, like, three years' retreat, where they do meditate 12 hours a day.
Of course, during the training, we do that with objects.
If you have a bout of depression, you'll go to the right side.
Some meditators, without trying to stop it, but simply by being completely open, thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event like a shooting star, they are able not to move at all.
Now, our compassion is supposed to be put in action.
Thank you very much.
And the thing that you really take away from that, the kind of surface thing that you take away from it, is not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that, but rather how different we are.
Do we all share a common origin, in fact?
So we're done, we can go home -- finished the origin question.
But that's not really the question I'm asking.
This must be who I'm directly descended from."
Which one of these guys am I actually related to?
And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans, and a blatantly racist category he termed "Monstrosus," which basically included all the people he didn't like, including imaginary folk like elves.
What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.
We have no written record. Well, actually, we do.
And the whole thing, if you add it all together, is over six billion nucleotides long.
It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.
Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees, they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.
Was it millions of years ago, which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world?
We're all effectively part of an extended African family.
It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.
The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.
Look at some stone tools.
The stone tools become much more finely crafted.
An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia, leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago, reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.
Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago, and finally, a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia, inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age -- temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps -- migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.
Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.
The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.
So how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples collected from indigenous people around the world.
Because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself.
And that's why that video feels a bit strange.
And slightly more complex things appear.
But to do it, you have do something that may, at first sight, seem completely impossible.
The universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom.
That's twice as long as humans have been on this planet.
These are tiny differences, but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity.
Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds.
Now, the going gets tougher.
Well, first, you need energy, but not too much.
In liquids, they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules.
You don't stabilize the individual; you stabilize the template, the thing that carries information, and you allow the template to copy itself.
The real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections.
You get fungi, you get fish, you get plants, you get amphibia, you get reptiles, and then, of course, you get the dinosaurs.
But it is so slow.
We seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift.
Human societies got larger, denser, more interconnected.
And it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role.
And now, finally, this is what I want.
Now you might ask, what is behavioral finance?
We were risk takers, of course.
How many of you have kids?
No one.
And what I'm going to talk about today is Save More Tomorrow.
They're just too lazy.
One out of 10 are saving enough.
So let me divert for a second as we're going to identify the problems, the challenges, the behavioral challenges, that prevent people from saving.
And then count down the days and see what people ended up eating.
So this issue of present bias causes us to think about saving, but end up spending.
Austria, a neighboring country, slightly similar, slightly different.
Not many people check boxes.
Very powerful.
The other group gets two apples, one is taken away.
So this notion of loss aversion kicks in when it comes to savings too, because people, mentally and emotionally and intuitively frame savings as a loss because I have to cut my spending.
And we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution called Save More, not today, Tomorrow.
But what are we going to do about the monkeys and loss aversion?
Saving more today is not an option.
This is a real difference.
If you think about people and mortgages and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it, we need to think about that.
Less than three percent of a very sophisticated audience.
But I guess that's in keeping, so now we'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation, ladies and gentlemen.
Probably somewhere around 1,500.
All right.
We're taking calls -- from the dead. We're taking calls -- from the dead. We're taking phone calls from the dead. They're calling from beyond the grave. Beyond the grave. They have some questions And things to share From underneath the cold, cold ground. We're soliciting phone calls from dead people as a special TED presentation.
This is Eleanor Roosevelt.
I want my million dollars.
You've been a wonderful 8:30 audience.
The other said, "How much did we hire him for?"
Elizabeth: If it please you, sir.
It's my one way of getting rid of my mind, getting rid of this mind that says, "Hey, you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing.
All preparation is preparation.
Until that hits you, you're not going to do the first shot.
Get rid of your mind.
Khota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace -- and we used to sleep out at night.
So, how far does eternity go?
But all before that there was a woodcutter.
A story is the relationship that you develop between who you are, or who you potentially are, and the infinite world, and that's our mythology.
If we do not create the stories, we probably go mad.
And I said, "Why?" He said, "Because nobody is going to give you a film if you talk about subtext.
So, the sequel to "Elizabeth," "Golden Age."
And the two divine people fought, and the gods were on the side of divinity.
Psychological.
Bess?
You ask my permission before you rut, before you breed.
My lady, it is my husband's child.
Get out.
Not only that, why is the camera looking down?
What's the process of telling a story?
I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster.
Now, where does this upper city and lower city come?
And, because democracy still exists, there's a democratic way in which you say "Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water."
That first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each other.
Harmony is not resolution.
And he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while.
But do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder? No."
We're born for them.
It's already halfway over, but something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care.
But once he gets there, he's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away and been entombed in a mausoleum on the property.
You could do it an infinite amount of ways.
It's the most inclusive approach you can take.
And it's like a magnet.
I don't mean to make it sound like this is an actual exact science, it's not.
Even after his father died, he was still trying to scratch that itch.
And some of us are born with temperaments that are positive, some are negative.
So I wanted to become much better at it and learn anything I could.
But under that was this global tension of will we ever find Nemo in this huge, vast ocean?
And the irony is that, in the first year, our story was not working at all and Disney was panicking.
And we had naively thought, well Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end, so you've got to start from someplace.
Are you deaf?
And that's what it really is, is that we all live life conditionally.
Yet, on the surface it just seemed to be depicting his historical lineage of what went on.
A strong theme is always running through a well-told story.
Like this.
It's like a dormant command that suddenly is activated in you, like a call to Devil's Tower.
I don't know if I really believe that.
It doesn't always mean plot or fact.
I was going to work on international development, and then I took a turn and ended up here.
And I got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps.
So I said, "Well, you've got to make a rainforest ice cream.
We paid two to three times more than anybody else.
We needed to be working on beef.
There's just one of them.
Our work shows that we're living at about 1.3 planets.
So when the average American consumes 43 times as much as the average African, we've got to think that consumption is an issue.
We have six billion units of consumption.
But we've also got to get consumption down.
Okay, so let's be generous.
Do organic potatoes actually have fewer toxic chemicals used to produce them than conventional potatoes?
And we need collusion.
Even if we get everybody working on it, we've got to be strategic.
Are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers?
This is nine of them.
A hundred companies, we can work with.
Even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there.
And yet, next week, we launch globally verified, vetted and certified standards for salmon aquaculture.
The good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago.
They're also undertaking a study to look at all of their supplies of palm oil to see if they could be certified and what they would need to change in order to become third-party certified under a credible certification program.
Buy it.
The rest of the land can be used for something else.
Coca-Cola, they've worked a lot on water, but right now, they're entering into 17-year contracts with growers in Turkey to sell juice into Europe, and they're doing that because they want to have a product that's closer to the European market.
We're all on that same journey with them.
It was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation.
But, as observed, after most injuries in humans, there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur.
I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor, Reggie Edgerton, to share my new idea.
First, we have to provide the fuel; second, press the accelerator pedal; third, steer the car.
This was amazing.
The robot is transparent, just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps.
We insisted. We refined our paradigm, and after several months of training, the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand, and whenever she decided, initiated full weight-bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards.
This novel training paradigm encouraged the brain to create new connections, some relay circuits that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control over the locomotor networks below the injury.
They are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of DNA.
Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury.
And remember, we are only as great as our imagination, as big as our dream.
And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant, with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America, and you, just getting through school, I want you to know that we have very much in common.
Neither of them attended university.
She's an active presence in their lives, as well as mine, and is instilling in them the same values that she taught me and my brother: things like compassion, and integrity, and confidence, and perseverance -- all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love that only a grandmother can give.
And his date was to go with him to a community meeting.
But Barack reminded us on that day, all of us in that room, that we all know what our world should look like.
That's why all of this that you're going through -- the ups and the downs, the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't -- why it's so important.
As the sign said back there, "without limitations."
I loved getting As.
That is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in.
It's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations.
Folks, you've just met Claron McFadden.
A few years ago, I did a meditation retreat in Thailand.
And after a moment, she opened her eyes and she looked at me and she said, "It's like meditation."
No notes, no flats, no sharps.
To me, this piece is an ode to the voice because it's mysterious -- as we can see -- it's quite spontaneous, and it's primal.
How many people have ever hitchhiked?
You might have had a French club or a Debate club.
The Internet has no business plan, never did.
And yet, mysteriously, somehow the bee flies.
It's just part of your neighborly duty.
And they can lather, rinse, repeat. And before you know it, you have a general sense of where everything is.
"That's right," it said, "I am YouTube."
One of the most popular websites in the world, run by the most powerful company in the world, and there was nothing that YouTube or Google were particularly privileged to do about it.
And they came together to help find the problem and fix it.
Right. Dumbest idea ever.
Suffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia stir-fried with pimentos.
"Anon attacking me for reverting."
They even gather together in such groups as the Counter-Vandalism Unit -- "Civility, Maturity, Responsibility" -- to just clean up the pages.
Now, it being encyclopedic and all, Wikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid.
As a lawyer, I've got to say these guys are inventing the law and stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along.
Yeah, I know. Number four, it's like, can you imagine coming home to that cat everyday?
It turns out that somebody lampooned here wrote to the snarky guy that does the site, not with a legal threat, not with an offer of payment, but just said, "Hey, would you mind?"
And it's no longer just a "I don't know. I couldn't get there. I guess I'll move on," but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online.
Why? There is the Craigslist rideshare board.
It's a bee that, yes, flies.

So in the '60s, the U.S. was first.
So with PISA, we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly.
In red, sort of below OECD average.
Opportunities are unequally distributed.
These countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all, a very important lesson.
You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings -- that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries, and poor and badly-educated ones, a very, very important lesson.
The answer is, students in Korea learn in large classes.
So you can see two countries spent their money very differently, and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education.
Germany, my own country, in the year 2000, featured in the lower quadrant, below average performance, large social disparities.
For example, traditionally, the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families, and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten.
Well, if you only focus on your brightest students, you know what happens is disparities grow, and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction, but still, an impressive improvement.
And all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity, high levels of performance, and raised outcomes?
Those are the critical questions, and what we have learned from PISA is that, in high-performing education systems, the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education, their future, more than consumption today.
When we asked students what counts for success in mathematics, students in North America would typically tell us, you know, it's all about talent.
And nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers.
Now the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom.
You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA, but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools.
That's also clear, and that's where some of the limits of international comparisons of PISA are.
And it has helped countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders.
And by and large, this has failed.
And so you can see, the real process of -- and this is backed up by this 500-page book -- that the authorities came down and citizens got up.
And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people, by the people, for the people.
So 12 years ago, I was trying to be an investment banker in New York.
And he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back.
If you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month, whatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted.
But if you come back to a poorer country, where the GNP per capita is, let's say, 500 dollars, or 300 dollars, then the impact is huge: 6,000 dollars. Or 5,000 dollars.
And Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists.
There were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones.
And of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power?
See, you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing.
I thought I could put cell towers and create a network.
And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow.
After about a million -- I mean, I got rejected from lots of places, because I was not only trying to go to a poor country, I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.
And these phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company.
Actually, this is an instance where private companies can provide that.
They are very eager learners and very capable survivors.
It's just an experiment.
I loved statistics from a young age.
And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience.
I will start at 1858.
1858 was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of India was defeated by the British forces.
And I will do that by bringing these bubbles back to a Gapminder graph here, where you can see each bubble is a country.
India was not always like this level.
And it's the new century now. Health is getting better, United Kingdom, United States.
In the 1930's now, you can see that Japan is going to a period of war, with lower life expectancy.
You can see that the health started to improve.
And we came to 1978, and Mao Tse Tung died, and a new guy turned up from the left.
And here they march on. And will they catch up?
You see this enormous inequity in China, in the midst of fast economic growth.
No, there is one more inequity. Look there, United States.
And when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward, you see that in between them and ahead of them, is the whole emerging economies of the world, which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the "flat world."
You see, China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.
The bubbles, not my bubbles, but the financial bubbles.
We add Japan to it.
Inequalities in China and India I consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market, what will avoid social instability, and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population.
Now if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided, get ready for a world in equity, because this is what seems to be happening.
Because, as I'll explain to you, the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.
In fact, this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale, and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that.
So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars, that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.
And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster.
But that cannot account for the mass either.
A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye.
You can respond. Up, right?
If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see?
It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.
On the graph paper, you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted.
So the streaks that you see, all these streaks, are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.
And we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions that say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.
That's what the expansion of the universe or space means.
So the expansion of space is actually speeding up.
So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.
We have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter.
So one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.
Now, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy, so it will be hard to tell the difference.
We discovered bluegrass a few years ago, and we fell in love with it. We hope you guys will too.
Yeah. I'm also going to explain, a lot of people want to know where we got the name Sleepy Man Banjo Boys from.
Sadly, it's come true. Malaria, as we all know, kills approximately one million people a year.
And over the course of half an hour, not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped.
In an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him, picked up a syringe and pricked his finger -- I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end -- and immediately whipped out a box of matches, lit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger, giving me full assurance that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV.
And they are having great fun.
If someone then tries to reuse it, it locks and breaks afterwards.
And this is a pretty well-educated audience, so I imagine you all know something about AIDS.
But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem that's more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology.
So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you.
We didn't see anything like that in Africa.
If version 10 is coming out next week, there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine.
But we really need to test that.
If you look at the blue line, the areas with low levels of malaria, you can see in those areas, actually, the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot as HIV prevalence goes up.
Because if you improve those things, then people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own.
In Uganda we see the prevalence went down.
We have no way to figure out what happened over time.
To do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease.
So it turns out, if you use this technique, actually your estimates of prevalence are very close to what we get from testing random samples in the population, but they're very, very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are.
If you think that 25 million people are infected, if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high, maybe that's more like 10 or 15 million.
It's good for improving people's lives.
By using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time, we can actually test that. And so it seems to be -- fortunately, I think -- it seems to be the case that these things are positively related.
So throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times the special case of Uganda, and the fact that it's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention.
So you can see that both of these series -- the black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections -- you can see they're both increasing.
There are tons of other things that we should think about doing.
And I can't wait to hear about what they are.
This is what happens every year.
This happens every year.
But it was fascinating to me, because I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers.
But it occurred to me, how in his small life had he already believed the myth that if something was that well done, that we must have done it.
What I'd like to do is show you a few of the things that they're learning.
And he studied -- there was a film about king fishers.
It has no bacteria on its surface, no fouling on its surface, no barnacles.
This is a little critter that's in the Namibian desert.
10 times better than our fog-catching nets.
They're really only using the blueprints or the recipes from the organisms.
And then we wonder why the membrane clogs and why it takes so much electricity.
This algorithm has been put into a software program that's now being used to make bridges lightweight, to make building beams lightweight.
One of our major inventions that we need to be able to do to come even close to what these organisms can do is to find a way to minimize the amount of material, the kind of material we use, and to add design to it.
But then right after that, they emit a protein that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles so that they fall out of solution.
And they're creating -- you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper.
And those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by 32 percent.
The question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate.
Now in order to do this, the design challenge of our century, I think, we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses, and to somehow meet them again.
And up will come mangroves, and sea turtles and your own kidneys.
I've been filming time-lapse flowers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 35 years.
It's like the canary in the coalmine.
"Well, why?"
I hope you'll drink, tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden.
I'm a product of this visionary mother and father.
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education.
One is a British, another is an American and the third is a Canadian.
Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing.
Why I said this, is the background.
So this was how it came into my service, and it was different from the men.
That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service.
Let's lock her up."
They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit.
Government had no budget.
Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers.
This was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners.
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind.
This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison.
Thank you very much.
The reason it works is because humans, at least non-visually-impaired humans, have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters, whereas computer programs simply can't do it as well yet.
This of course, is not as bad as this poor person.
But then I started feeling bad.
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds?
You've seen those things, right? Like a book?
For example, for things that were written more than 50 years ago, the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words.
So this is how the system works.
Now of course, since we're doing so many words per day, funny things can happen.
Here's another really bad one.
Then of course, you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book.
This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCH 750 million, which is a little over 10 percent of the world's population, has helped us digitize human knowledge.
This is something that we've been semi-quietly working on for the last year and a half or so.
So I posed this question to him: How can we get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free?
Now some of you may say, why can't we use computers to translate?
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript.
And then comes the ending, which is my favorite part of the whole thing.
Wikipedia exists in Spanish, but it's very small compared to the size of English.
The other problem you're going to run into is a lack of motivation.
People really, really want to learn a foreign language.
And as you translate them, and as you see how other people translate them, you start learning the language.
And not only do they learn it as well, but actually it's way more interesting.
And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo, none of whom knew any German before they started using the site.
Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users, we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project.
Since people are creating value while they're learning, they don't have to pay their money, they pay with their time.
Twelve years ago, I founded Zipcar.
This does express the humanity of what's going on, and the personal relationships, but that is also like saying that it's the same thing as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting.
It delivers localization and customization, specialization, and all of this aspect about social networks and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there?
I met these founders just weeks after they had launched, and now, in two years, what would you do for five dollars?
It just celebrated its seventh anniversary, and after seven years, last year it delivered 530 million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects.
So I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now, and a Peers, Inc. company, because I've spent the last two years doing that in Paris.
So this was a trick to get these two sides.
So I thought, "Duh, Robin, this is the difference between industrial production and peer production."
Cool guys, excited guys, and here is Selma, who -- I love this driver.
type of thing that's happening here, because individuals, if you're a company, what happens is you might have 10 people who are in charge of innovation, or 100 people who are in charge of innovation.
So for me, it's a collaboration.
The paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically, we haven't actually gotten any happier.
It certainly seems that we're going about our lives, that what we're doing, who we're with, what we're thinking about, have a big influence on our happiness, and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult, in fact almost impossible, for scientists to study.
This guy is sitting here working on his computer, and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month, wondering what he's going to have for dinner.
In other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering.
Now you might look at this result and say, okay, sure, on average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering, but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with, at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.
Maybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever disentangle these two possibilites?
Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing.
I was born in Switzerland and raised in Ghana, West Africa.
The firing squad aimed, fired -- the general was dead.
I was always playing the exotic African.
And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality, though a fragile reality.
So here I was, December 7th, 2008.
The rhetoric of the candidates, of course, changed.
And my heart sank, because I thought, here we are again.
The sounds of the voices were harmonious.
Now the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either.
Now I have learned that my place is not just in the West or in Africa, and I'm still searching for my identity, but I saw Ghana create democracy better.
And when surfers are out waiting for waves, you probably wonder, if you've never been out there, what are they doing?
That -- you know, I was born thinking about things that way, and I had always been like a little scientist guy.
And Charles II, the son, was finally put back on the throne of England.
And people in the 17th century, they didn't really understand the same way we do about you know, this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules, and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that.
And you know, Boyle says, well, shit.
I do that on the weekend. And like -- what I'm trying to do is figure out what happens when you suck everything out of a compartment.
Charles II was kind of saying, you know, you should keep that -- let's make a place where you can do this stuff where people don't get so -- you know, we don't want the -- we don't want to get the people mad at me again. And so -- because when they started talking about religion and science and stuff like that, that's when it had sort of gotten his father in trouble.
And so, they would come in and you would do -- Anybody that was going to show an experiment, which was kind of a new word at the time, demonstrate some principle, they had to do it on stage, where everybody could see it.
You say, anytime you have a vacuum state, you will discover that one wheel will not turn another one, if the only connection between them is whatever was there before the vacuum. That kind of thing.
It didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes, who was a local philosopher, said about it, you know, because you weren't going to be talking final causes.
Remember, that's a short time.
I mean, individuals own things that kings would have definitely gone to war to get.
Audience: Here.
They send it out for amateur rocketeers, and it said in there do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar.
So, I went to the drug store and I tried to buy some potassium perchlorate and it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid to walk into a drug store and buy chemicals.
It burned kind of slow, but it made a nice smell, compared to other rocket fuels I had tried, that all had sulfur in them.
There's a lot of little things involved in making a rocket that it will actually work, even after you have the fuel.
But I wasn't worried, by the way, about, you know, the explosion causing the destruction of the planet.
Because the results of it were so spectacular that if it worked it was going to change everybody's goddamn way of doing molecular biology.
I mean, you can't make up results, and then do another experiment based on that one.
Scientists, you know, made World War II as we know it quite possible.
You want to be rich, you be a businessman.
But there's a good explanation for that.
But nobody actually demonstrated it, right?
And those two papers came out in Science Magazine, February the first, and these -- the conclusion in both of these papers, and in also the Science editor's, like, descriptions of these papers, for, you know, for the quickie, is that our theories about global warming are completely wrong. I mean, what these guys were doing, and this is what -- the NASA people have been saying this for a long time.
But if we did, in 2025 or something, have double the CO2 as we had in 1900, they say it would be increase the energy budget by about -- in other words, one watt per square centimeter more would be coming in than going out.
if they -- if they -- if they actually -- if they actually said that, I'm getting out.
Remember the 10 things that are going to get you. The -- one of them -- And the asteroids is the one I really agree with there.
And so, in 2005, we started the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory so that we would have a small organization that could do this work and support it.
This was really an extraordinary advance, because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells, which still remain the gold standard, they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery.
And this opens up the ability, which hopefully will become something that is routine in the near term, of using human cells to test for drugs.
But it isn't really enough just to look at the cells from a few people or a small group of people, because we have to step back.
There's a wonderful drug, and a class of drugs actually, but the particular drug was Vioxx, and for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain, the drug was an absolute lifesaver, but unfortunately, for another subset of those people, they suffered pretty severe heart side effects, and for a subset of those people, the side effects were so severe, the cardiac side effects, that they were fatal.
It's like having an app without having a smartphone.
At some point in our lives, all of us, or people we care about, become patients, and that's why I think that stem cell research is incredibly important for all of us.
and in grad school I became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.
I'll follow the rats."
This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.
This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct, which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.
The murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991 when the tunnel reopened for trains.
I was basically intruding in his living space.
The tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the Manhattan Project.
I love to travel, and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.
As you can see, the system is very complex and vast.
The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance, which Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes -- I guess, except for in this picture.
But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series.
That's an in-joke, by the way.
I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter, but why? And finally, would you be able to -- and you can sort of scribble it, if you like -- scribble a plan diagram of the solar system, showing the shape of the planets' orbits?
A little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff, 99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.
Now, I have some rather bad news, which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you, which unfortunately -- the sound doesn't work in this room, so I'm going to describe to you, in true "Monty Python" fashion, what happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers go to MIT on graduation day.
As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people -- we might as well get it right.
By extension, we think to ourselves, "Why it's hotter in summer than in winter must be because we're closer to the Sun."
If you believe, as most of you probably do, that it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun, you must have drawn an ellipse.
What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system, to show that it's not really like that?
So, being I'm in the United States, I'll have a dig at the Europeans.
So, as "Monty Python" would have it, this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so, but this is -- children are not empty vessels.
And we collude. We design tests, or at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right?
So, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see.
There's been four billion years of organic, biological life.
And evolution, although it was established well over 100 years ago by Charles Darwin and a vast number of other people, evolution still is a little bit intangible.
So this raises three really important questions: What is life?
And all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago, and they look alive.
But there's a problem, because up until maybe a decade ago, we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe.
And so the problem with chemists -- and this is a massive advantage as well -- is we like to focus on our elements.
So we have to think differently if we're going to make stuff come alive.
You have regulation; information is transcribed; catalysts are made; stuff is happening.
And Darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague that he thought that life probably emerged in some warm little pond somewhere -- maybe not in Scotland, maybe in Africa, maybe somewhere else.
Evolution kicked in -- and that's the cool bit.
This seems most likely.
So the whole area's been stuck for a while, and it got reignited in the '80s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on.
But I need a metabolism, I need some energy.
And so forgive the molecules on the screen, but these are a very simple kit.
And all I wanted to show you is we can set up molecules in membranes, in real cells, and then it sets up a kind of molecular Darwinism, a molecular survival of the fittest.
So we have this special theory of evolution that applies only to organic biology, to us.
What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.
You need to somehow find the fitness function.
So what will that tell us about the origin of life and the meaning of life?
When?
So the other thing that if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon, maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for.
Take child mortality; the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two-thirds, from 1990 to 2015.
Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics.
No -- low-income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization.
But these surveys are costly, so they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals.
But watch out -- they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing.
I was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer, and I saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 just that morning.
It's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now.
We got, later, the mosquito netting.
If your economy grows with four percent, you ought to reduce child mortality four percent; if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it.
Here we have [the] year.
This was the backlash in Kenya, and Ghana bypassed, but then Kenya and Ghana go down together -- still a standstill in Congo.
What a strange personality disorder we must have, counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate.
But look, the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast.
We want others to be better than we were, and indeed, others have been better.
Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible.
This is, once again, 1960 -- 50 years ago.
What I want you [to do] now is to see with your own eyes the relation between fall in child mortality and decrease in family size.
This is the vision we have, isn't it.
They get Samsung, how can they be [a] developing country?
We have to have a modern concept, which fits to the data.
It's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together.
The big residual is always value for money.
Well, you are to ride a bicycle, carrying your own weight and also some other weight, so that you can earn the bread for the day.
An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done.
And it was [unclear] Tata Trust, which gave me six rupees per month, almost a dollar per month for six years.
And you can see the cartoon here.
And he said, "Well, I won't define the vehicle for you, but I will define the cost for you.
But who was the team leader?
100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant, and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed.
You can't cross that envelope, which is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars.
And British Motor was around 11,000.
It is not just technological, it is social innovation that we talk about.
What is its price? 20,000 dollars.
And if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe, you're talking about 10,000 days of income.
See, he jumps. You can see what stress it must have.
Let's move on to something else.
Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace, after all the human and animal testing, was 10 years, now it is 15 years.
1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way, and 20 of them.
Looks absolutely audacious.
And you can see this blending of traditional medicine, modern medicine, modern science.
And he also said, "I would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all."
So you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost.
You know, incubators for infants, for example.
It's not just innovation, compassion and passion -- compassion in the heart and passion in the belly.
The 21st century gift, which is very, very important for the whole world, whether it is global economic meltdown, whether it is climate change -- any problem that you talk about is gaining more from less for more and more -- not only the current generations, for the future generations.
I remember, I went to a poor school, because my mother could not gather the 21 rupees, that half a dollar that was required within the stipulated time.
And then the paper burned.
What does that convex lens do?
I'm trying to build a global team, which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing.
So I went to work programming it, and I released it just before the holidays in 2010.
Well, this is how I approached it. This is what I did.
This is so I can share my experiences with others.
First of all, I'd like to create more apps, more games.
But this is actually a talk about, okay -- — but this is actually a talk about fission.
This is a small modular reactor.
For someone who's done a lot of counterterrorism work, I can't extol to you how great having something buried below the ground is for proliferation and security concerns.
So it's a molten salt reactor. It has a core, and it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt, the radioactive salt, to a cold salt which isn't radioactive.
This is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity, and this makes this almost 50 percent efficient, between 45 and 50 percent efficiency.
And they eat them up, which means that, combined with the fact that the cladding doesn't last very long, you can only run one of these reactors for roughly, say, 18 months without refueling it.
And this is really important, because the reaction stops.
You can put them anywhere in the world you want to.
I mean, now we're talking about 100 megawatts.
I think that I've designed this reactor here that can be an innovative source of energy, provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications, and I'm really prepared to do this.
And to talk about that, I'm going to go back to the beginning, because in the beginning were commodities.
Now, there's an antidote to commoditization, and that is customization.
So we're shifting to an experience economy, where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering.
Now, over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe, and particularly in the Netherlands, and whenever I talk about the experience economy there, I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question, almost invariably.
Why? Because the experience happens inside of us.
And the Dutch, they always go ...
It's about supply and availability.
Because all businesses are man-made objects; all business is involved with money; all business is a matter of using machinery, and all those things make something inauthentic.
There are two dimensions to authenticity: one, being true to yourself, which is very self-directed.
And of course, if you are both true to yourself, and are what you say you are, then you're real real!
A wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as -- you know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake, right, because you can see behind the facade, right?
But it is -- oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to -- -- sorry.
And what you have done in the past limits what you can do, what you can get away with, essentially, in the future.
So, understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future.
Right, it's not advertising does it.
Take that same good, and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer, in a corner diner, in a bodega, a kiosk somewhere, you get 50 cents, maybe a buck per cup of coffee.
A few words about how I got started, and it has a lot to do with happiness, actually.
I fell in love with the way things moved, so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks.
So, I started taking art courses, and I found a way to make sculpture that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands, with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system.
The next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex.
When I see objects, I imagine them in motion.
That's about that big.
This whole thing is about four feet wide, and the chair itself is only about a few inches.
What would I love?
It's definitely happy.
And that was that tool.
It would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.
So, I imagined a very simple gestural dance that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ...
And that means the complete cycle of coming from inside, out to the physical, to someone perceiving it.
And the only place that collagen changes its structure is in the cornea of your eye.
Video text: "From Conception to Birth" Oocyte Sperm Egg Inseminated 24 Hours: Baby's first division The fertilized ovum divides a few hours after fusion ...
And as we kept on scanning more and more, working on this project, looking at these two simple cells that have this kind of unbelievable machinery that will become the magic of you.
Six weeks, these folds are now beginning with the papilla on the inside of the heart actually being able to pull down each one of those valves in your heart until you get a mature heart -- and then basically the development of the entire human body.
59,999 miles that are basically bringing nutrients and taking waste away.
I have a very difficult task.
One of my colleagues in Bulgaria, Nevena Markova, spent about 20 years studying these profiles.
But you have it in planets and asteroids.
I bet that there were very few people who really understood what I'm talking about.
And if you have a liquid hot mass, it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum.
And we have a cool atmosphere.
For instance, you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun.
The other day, my colleague from Berkeley, Gibor Basri, emailed me a very interesting spectrum, asking me, "Can you have a look at this?"
There is interaction of galaxies. We know this.
It's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.
Doppler Effect is something very important from fundamental physics.
This is the sound of an Alpha Cen.
If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium, probably, again, there would be no life.
And then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here.
It's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum.
And with the known physics etc, it's something actually which has been pointed out by Frank Drake, many years ago, and Shklovsky.
And we have some interesting cases, candidates, so on, things which we can't really explain.
In about five years we will discover planets like Earth, around sun-like stars, the same distance as the Earth from the Sun.
And I was like, "Okay."
I'm a qualitative researcher.
When I was a young researcher, doctoral student, my first year I had a research professor who said to us, "Here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist."
And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me, because I am interested in some messy topics.
So I thought, you know what, I'm going to start with connection.
And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection?
So I was ready, and I was really excited.
I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay -- and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness -- that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness -- they have a strong sense of love and belonging -- and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough.
So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am I going to call this research?
And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute.
They talked about the willingness to say, "I love you" first, the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees, the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram.
A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown, but I assure you it was a breakdown.
So I found a therapist.
And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love.
And I said, "Oh my God, this is going to suck."
And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted, what choices they were making, and what are we doing with vulnerability.
Because I wanted to know what's out there.
I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.
And it becomes this dangerous cycle.
This is what politics looks like today.
Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, "Wow."
Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we'll end the problems I think that we see today.
Can I believe in this this passionately?
My heart rate was 61 beats per minute -- my blood pressure, 127 over 74.
Now, we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle -- the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices, the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing, and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.
You're probably familiar with the Nike+ system.
This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C.
Some people will say it's for biometric security.
This is him on the screen.
Because, as we all know here today, it doesn't work very well.
But it's a story until we convert it to data and so what we do, this concept we had, was to take Steven's status, "What is my status?"
And he could still hold his wife's hand, but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes, can't feed himself.
Not stories in words, but stories in data and words.
Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient.
I love some of these, physical exercise, prayer.
How they treat it, the drugs, the components of it, their side effects, all of it in a rich environment, and you can drill down and see the individuals.
This is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash.
You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms.
I don't even know what a medical record is.
This is about the patients.
You've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about the amazing things they've done.
Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium.
You know, a data network.
Can we find out what's going to happen to you, so that you can maybe change it?"
And it works almost every time.
It's the Intent to Treat Curve.
We asked our control algorithm, are those 69 patients -- by the way, you'll notice that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial -- can we look at those patients and say, "Can we match them with our time machine to the other patients that are just like them, and what happens?"
I mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him.
Because something went different.
And I am thankful.
Something always seems to stop us.
And yet I think it's this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions.
Six and a half years later, a hundred and eighty researchers, they have some amazing developments in the lab, and I will show you three of those today, such that we can stop burning up our planet and instead, we can generate all the energy we need right where we are, cleanly, safely, and cheaply.
It's a thousand times more conductive than copper.
Imagine if we didn't have to rely on artificial lighting to get around at night.
It's a film that you can look through.
We want to talk about storing energy, and unfortunately the best thing we've got going is something that was developed in France a hundred and fifty years ago, the lead acid battery.
It's my energy.
In fact, it's going to require twice the world's supply of oil to run the pumps to generate the water.
It's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst.
That's what I say in my mind. And I just say "thank you," and I go on to the next one.
The second quote is from the head of the U.K. Financial Services Authority.
I ended up in physics by accident.
This paradox is what got me interested in complex systems.
So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts.
The study we published last year called "The Network of Global Corporate Control" was the first extensive analysis of economic networks.
In this little example, you can see a few financial institutions with some of the many links highlighted.
This is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall.
So you have a periphery and a center which contains about 75 percent of all the players, and in the center there's this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly interconnected companies.
If you have more than 50 percent of the shares in a company, you get control, but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares.
If you want to compute the flow in an ownership network, this is what you have to do.
And it gets even more extreme.
So you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt, yet it "gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance."
Reality is so complex, we need to move away from dogma.
Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet from pollen and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar.
So they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it, and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh, and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body, and she takes it home as food.
I had never thought about insects living in complex societies.
My personal favorite, and one that I've studied for many years, is their system of healthcare.
Humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times.
In the United States, bees in fact have been in decline since World War II.
And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures.
There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production that requires bee pollination.
It moves through the plant so that a crop pest, a leaf-eating insect, would take a bite of the plant and get a lethal dose and die.
I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it, and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus, but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu, and I know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition.
So what are we going to do?
Set aside farmland.
So let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large-scale change.
That's not 30 percent a year, that's -- Yes, thirty percent a year.
And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world with brute-force assembly techniques.
Take piping.
So what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale?
And then we embed elastic.
And so these became intuitive models to understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale.
So remember, I said 4D.
Here's the first demonstration.
And we're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials for the built environment.
Imagine if water pipes could expand or contract to change capacity or change flow rate, or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves.
I was two years older than my sister at the time -- I mean, I'm two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do, and I wanted to play war.
... heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet, for which I have yet to be thanked, I was trying as hard as I could -- she didn't even see it coming -- I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior.
Of course, this was an option that was open to her brain at no point in the past.
This graph looks boring, but this graph is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning.
Which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many Advil the average person should be taking -- two.
And what I posit and what positive psychology posits is that if we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average.
I have a brother in-law named Bobo -- which is a whole other story.
When I got a military scholarship two weeks later, they allowed me to go.
When they'd come to visit me, they'd look around, they'd say, "This freshman dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart's from the movie "Harry Potter," which it does.
75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels, your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat.
Which I'm glad you liked, but they did not like that at all.
That undergirds most of our parenting styles, our managing styles, the way that we motivate our behavior.
Your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise.
Not only does it make you happier, it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way.
We get people, when they open up their inbox, to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network.
And -- anyone remember this workbook, "Instant Activities for Your Apple" -- free poster in each book?
And, you see, this era coincided with my own childhood.
That's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver, really: he would invent, like, ways to make things heavy.
Bad blocks. But anyways, the tofu to me was kind of my origin, basically.
I made a desktop publishing system way back when, and that was, kind of, my first step into figuring out how to -- oh, these two sides are kind of fun to mix.
I got my masters, and then went to art school after that.
This is in the '80s, in the great clash of computer/non-computer people.
And then I thought, what if I added this feature, where I can say, this point, you can fly like a bird. You're free, kind of thing.
And he said, Even worse. Stop it now.
They're laughing because he said, draw from the middle-right to the middle, and he kind of messed up.
So, this happened in 1993.
This computer appears to be fast - she's working pretty hard, and people are running around, and we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate.
So, I began to experiment with industry in different ways with this kind of mixture of skills.
He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo.
How do you take that time you have left and go after it?
And also, at the same time I was frustrated, because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere, and there were these, like, "the computer lab," you know, and this is, like, in the late 1990s, and this is in Basel, a great graphic design school.
Do you hear that? It's like cows. This is at 4 a.m. at Logan.
I began to be fascinated by plastic, so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks perfectly optically transparent, as a kind of release of stress.
This is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp: it's sort of a plastic rice lamp; it's very friendly.
So, this is, like, in front of the Eiffel Tower, really, actually, around the Louvre area.
I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design, which we know as circle-triangle-square.
So, three years ago I discovered, the letters M-I-T occurring in simplicity and complexity.
Who's a RISD alum out there?
There's my perspective. Because in reality, the problem isn't how to make the world more technological.
So I'm not going to do that. I'm not interested in doing that.
For every 100 girls in special education, there are 217 boys.
And so we should.
Guess what?
What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun?
Boy comes home from school, and he says, "I hate writing."
I want to write about this really interesting world.
Anybody who's over 15 doesn't know what this means, because in the last 10 years, the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half.
Men don't belong here, that's pretty obvious.
We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there.
And what happens is, she says, "Please, sit down, be quiet, do what you're told, follow the rules, manage your time, focus, be a girl."
So what do we do?
So we need to design better games.
But it only treats a few kids, and so this isn't very scalable.
And they're always talking about this stuff."
So I've got to do gaming, or I've got to do sports."
Too many questions are left unanswered.
We will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe, and to explain my point, let me first tell you what the Higgs is about, and to do so, we have to go back to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang.
And this intrinsic energy is what we call the mass of a particle, and by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC has conclusively proved that this substance is real, because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of.
You would have to wait a really long time before it happens, but believe me, quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon, and it has been observed in many systems.
If the Higgs field were only a few times more intense, we would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating, and hydrogen would be the only possible chemical element in the universe.
Our calculations showed that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass is very special.
Even so, we will be long gone by then.
It has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles, and each bubble is a different universe with different fundamental constants and different physical laws.
My story does not have an end, because we still don't know the end of the story.
I love to collect things.
So, this is interesting to me, but it lacked a certain human element.
This is a piece called Blend, and what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art.
I'd never really memorialized myself.
You're actually implicit in this work and you're erasing my life.
And the result is the Terrafugia Transition.
And on our third high-speed testing deployment on a bitter cold morning in upstate New York, we got to do that for the first time.
It turns out that driving, with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles, is actually a harder problem to solve than flying.
Now let's see it in action.
And you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.
So despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary, we really focused on doing as little new as possible.
Here's why.
And the unleaded automotive fuel that we use is both cheaper and better for the environment than traditional avgas.
Now, I'm from New York, so it's 100 percent satisfaction here.
You couldn't satisfy this guy.
"Discouraging data on the antidepressant."
"I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me."
The bars protect us. That's sort of fun, right?
Of course, many, many cartoons must be rejected.
Here's one of his cartoons.
Well, after 1977, I broke into The New Yorker and started selling cartoons.
This is What Lemmings Believe.
Now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great similarity.
Basically, that's the way humor works.
Now here's a little video made by Matt Diffee, sort of how they imagine if we really exaggerated that.
No. No.
Office worker: BLT?BM: No.
See, that's probably not going to be New Yorker humor.
In other words, for something to be funny, we've got to think it's both wrong and also okay at the same time.
You're reading about this smart stuff, this intelligent dissection of the immune system.
If we're in a purposeful mood, that makes us anxious.
"Too snug?"
Better left undrawn.
These cartoons are not about them. They're about us.
The target is the readership and the people who do it.
The New Yorker demands some cognitive work on your part, and what it demands is what Arthur Koestler, who wrote "The Act of Creation" about the relationship between humor, art and science, is what's called bisociation.
Like, this cartoon would puzzle many people.
That could happen. It's humor within the realm of reality.
"It sort of makes you stop and think, doesn't it."
You can either live in a world which is poorer, which people in general don't like.
What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels, pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus for the entire duration of the journey.
So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.
And you get a far lower risk of famine, because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.
And he planted it in a royal potato patch, with guards who had instructions to guard over it, night and day, but with secret instructions not to guard it very well.
Ataturk was a lateral thinker.
As an advertising man, I have to admire that.
In Britain we tend to feel, "Whoa! Got another three!"
It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.
What Warhol said about Coke is, he said, "What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States can't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street."
When I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food.
This is mobile food. British are very good at that.
It tastes great within the borders of that country, but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else.
Now, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying.
Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal, only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.
But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.
Woman # 3: Or an "M" and a "W". An "M" and a "W", exactly.
If you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called the American Institute of Wine Economics, which actually does extensive research into perception of things, and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people, there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine, except when you tell the people how expensive it is, in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.
They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.
I couldn't even do the simplest trick, but it was very natural for me, because I was not dextrous, and hated all sports.
I was so excited. "Yes, I did it! I became a hero.
I started to learn classic ballet, jazz dance, acrobatics and other things to make my performance better.
We humans are Earth's Pandoran species.
Isn't that a wonderful thought, that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had?
What did Darwin say?
He had no concept of the idea of an algorithm, but that's what he described in that book, and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm.
SB: No, not without.
Now, what's this to do with memes?
Not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going, "I want to get copied."
This is design process going on.
A meme is not equivalent to an idea.
All right everyone, who's got some interesting memes for me?
Some of them will be copied even though they're not.
Audience: SB: Mmm mmm.
Other people are just lazy and make mistakes.
Now, why is this important?
From the moment that our ancestors, perhaps two and a half million years ago or so, began imitating, there was a new copying process.
Language is a parasite that we've adapted to, not something that was there originally for our genes, on this view.
I've been wondering for a long time, since I've been thinking about memes a lot, is there a difference between the memes that we copy -- the words we speak to each other, the gestures we copy, the human things -- and all these technological things around us?
So actually, now the temes are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines.
In 1961, Frank Drake made his famous equation, but I think he concentrated on the wrong things.
A very simple equation.
Getting a new replicator is dangerous.
Think of the big brain.
It's a really expensive organ to run.
Well, we did pull through, and we adapted.
We are the old machines.
We make new ones, and so it's convenient to piggyback on us, because we're not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable.
The first, it's coming too.
My wife sent me a message, "Whoa, earthquake," and then disappeared for 25 minutes.
This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.
We inspected medical centers and food warehouses.
And we know how to build properly.
This is Xantus Daniel; he's a mason, just a general construction worker, not a foreman, who took one of our trainings.
Now there are many groups doing this.
When I go to parties, it doesn't usually take very long for people to find out that I'm a scientist and I study sex.
And this is true both of my recent project on sex differences in the brain, and my more mature work on the anatomy and function of penises.
And the question I get when I start talking about this most often is, "What made you interested in this subject?"
And it's really an odd sort of structure.
Instead they're more like reinforced water balloons.
It has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid -- in this case blood -- surrounded by a wall of tissue that's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen.
So he sat me down, and he warned me.
And you can see two layers of fibers, one in blue and one in yellow, arranged in left-handed and right-handed angles.
What new thing are you contributing to our knowledge of biology?
I was really surprised at this.
But the only difference is that the fibers are arranged differently.
Not just about its genetics and molecular biology, but up here in the meat end of the scale.
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.
They told me that they had the right model of the patient -- that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain -- and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ...
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it, and I would crunch it a little bit.
It turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity, I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower.
Is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things, or are we talking a more endemic situation, that many people are actually capable of behaving this way?
Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack, and tell me how many questions you got correctly."
So, we try to test this.
You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down, people would cheat more, but again, this was not the case.
Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor?
Then they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever.
Now, this is not a good social science experiment, so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before.
Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference?
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment, and we told them that at the end, we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make. OK?
Nobody knew it was an actor.
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students.
We've learned that a lot of people can cheat.
What happens when you do other things, like you remove things from money?
And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them.
I felt my intuition was correct."
But if I was to say that they're both examples of alternative or new forms of currency in a hyperconnected, data-driven global economy, you'd probably think I was a little bit bonkers.
And I'm probably not going to do it proper service here, but my interpretation of how it works is that Bitcoins are released through this process of mining.
But what it does show is that it's sort of gaining ground, it's gaining respectability.
There's a P.R. company called Edelman, they do this very interesting survey every year precisely around trust and what people are thinking.
So if you think we're starting to question and disrupt and interrogate what money means, what our relationship with it is, what defines money, then the ultimate extension of that is, is there a reason for the government to be in charge of money anymore?
You know, when you are standing in line in Starbucks, 30 percent of transactions in Starbucks on any one day are actually being made with Starbucks Star points.
This is a fantastic article I came across in New York Magazine, where it was saying that drug users across America are actually purchasing drugs with bottles of Tide detergent.
Now, what I thought was funny was the reaction from the P&amp;G spokesperson.
So what happens with this is they're saying, "Right, you have a data dashboard. We know how far you've run, how far you've moved, what your calorie intake, all that sort of stuff.
So when Vodafone came in and saw this problem, this consumer pain point, they created some small change which they call Fakka, which literally sits and is given by the shopkeepers to people, and it's credit that goes straight onto their mobile phone.
And the only thing that stopped that, the government controlled four percent of the supply, and the only thing that stopped it was the Civil War breaking out, and the government suddenly wanted to take control of the money.
Thank you.
His name's Buddy MacMaster, and just a wonderful guy, and we have a great tradition at home called square dancing, and we had parties, great parties at our house and the neighbors' houses, and you talk about kitchen cèilidhs.
There are four girls a little bit older than me.
That's how we met.
That's it.
NM: Well, we're gonna play one together now.
NM: I feel like I'm in the duck or the bird pose right now.
DL: How fast?
DL: What about Leahy?
NM: Is this what marriage is about?
Strolling along in Central Park Everyone's out today The daisies and dogwoods are all in bloom Oh, what a glorious day For picnics and Frisbees and roller skaters, Friends and lovers and lonely sunbathers Everyone's out in merry Manhattan in January I brought the iced tea; Did you bring the bug spray? The flies are the size of your head Next to the palm tree, Did you see the 'gators Looking happy and well fed? Everyone's out in merry Manhattan in January Everyone!
He fled Germany, together with his family, leaving everything else behind.
And that's me, I was going to say holding my first abacus, but actually holding what my father would consider an ample substitute to an iPad.
Now, we had to start somewhere, and so Noam and I decided to base our cathedral, so to speak, on the simplest possible building block, which is something called NAND.
The trick was to decompose the computer's construction into numerous stand-alone modules, each of which could be individually specified, built and unit-tested in isolation from the rest of the project.
And Parag Shah, another engineer, from Mumbai, has unbundled our projects into smaller, more manageable bites that he now serves in his pioneering do-it-yourself computer science program.
So here's what Dan said.
We are obsessed with grades because we are obsessed with data, and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing, and a huge part of education is about failing.
When you deal with a concept like area -- well, we also provide a set of tools that the child is invited to experiment with in order to learn.
Moving along, what about the area of a triangle?
The driving force behind this project is my colleague Shmulik London, and, you see, just like Salman did about 90 years ago, the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people, because at the end, it's all about people.
I was 21.
It is a symbol of an interconnected world.
Countless women, men and children have been raped, tortured or enslaved.
One well-known illicit trade route is that across the border to Rwanda, where Congolese tantalum is disguised as Rwandan.
TED has always celebrated what technology can do for us, technology in its finished form.
Recent U.K. legislation could be used in the same way.
Even if I could have afforded the phone bills home, like most people in the Congo, my parents did not own a phone line.
Their availability for work can be such that it's, "A few hours today.
They'd have to be bookable in about the next minute.
Everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow.
And it's monitoring their reliability.
Let's make it personal.
These are good sites, but I believe we can go a step further.
So why do we have this disparity between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading, and what the rest of us have?
Like everyone else, those policymakers are taking it for granted that modern markets are the preserve of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves.
Not necessarily.
But let's suppose that our aim is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid.
It's about public spending going through these markets to buy public services at the local level.
So government then exits the frame.
This would be a world of very small trades, but very well-informed, because national e-markets will deliver data.
So if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training, an investor can pay for it and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals for maybe the next two years.
It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.
Single mother, HIV positive.
Just -- Actually, I was working at the time, doing production for a fashion photographer.
We've known about fusion since 1920, when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington and the British Association for the Advancement of Science conjectured that that's why the sun shines.
Coal-powered industrial revolution in this country -- oil, gas, sorry.
Fission.
Okay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics.
And you can get energy out this way.
So, most of the time they repel.
Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees, but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.
If you just plot how much fuel we've got left, in units of present world consumption.
To go any further you would have to have breeder technology.
So, how would we make it?
When people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be, I say, "Yeah, but we've actually done it." Right?
You can't. You have to do it in a very big device.
But at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.
Anyone heard of it?
It has nothing to do with the fact that I was born there, of course.
In 2010, right before the revolution, even though GDP per capita had been growing at five percent for several years, Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives.
Among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice.
So rather than viewing their former regimes as generous if overprotective fathers, they viewed them as essentially prison wardens.
Whether they support Islamists or liberals, Egyptians' priorities for this government are identical, and they are jobs, stability and education, not moral policing.
What really changed after the ouster of Mubarak wasn't that life got easier.
The Egyptian people, and many other Arabs who've revolted and are in transition, have very high expectations of the government.
Now people have raised some real concerns about what the rise of Islamist parties means for women.
What about men's views of religion and law?

And the secret is she opens every single one.
We're finding it 11 times more powerful than email.
It's my dad. Are you there?"
It's fast, it's pretty private.
There's something in New York City.
Or maybe there's some anecdotal evidence.
Thank you.
I feel a little uncomfortable.
In 1895, Lord Kelvin declared that heavier-than-air flying machines were impossible.
You see, they were having trouble in this flight regime, and it wasn't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound.
And we've had to refuse to fear failure.
Now the Minotaur IV has too much impulse, so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an 89 degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory.
In the first flight, no aerodynamic control of the vehicle.
It can fly up, down, forwards, backwards, even upside-down.
Many prototypes crashed -- many.
A gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe.
This is a spider mite.
Experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS.
Tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months, and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever.
And together they changed the fate of their nation.
So who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA?
Scientists and engineers can indeed change the world.
But there isn't anyone else; there's just you.
And when he hit send, he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make.
I have a couple of questions.
What do you picture that glider being used for?
RD: No, not necessarily just a camera.
The folks at AeroVironment tried 300 or more different wing designs, 12 different forms of the avionics.
RD: Well look, our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise.
RD: Sure.
Regina, that was jaw-dropping, as they say.
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there.
There is no way back home.
So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse.
It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy or with some energy far greater than myself.
And I told him, "Let's find a way in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week to ride with in the summer in the country."
Every small obstacle, every slight uphill, would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up.
His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.
It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do.
"Go away you maniac-psychopath.
And he ended up in south Tel Aviv and did not have the good luck to be picked up by a [unclear] and roamed the streets and became a prominent gang member.
It all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project, that the purpose of these rides should actually be to expose the kids to one thing only: love.
Before each ride we sit together with the kids, and we give them one word to think about during the ride.
Now, let me give you an example of how it works.
And that's the point when you start loving yourself.
Now I remember, when he said it, I felt goosebumps on my body, because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background.
Here's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago -- and I ride with them tomorrow also.
You know how newborn babies believe they're part of everything; they're not separate?
Or who we really want to be, or should be?
My dad is white from Cornwall, and my mom is black from Zimbabwe.
It has an extremely important function.
Another world was opening up around this time: performance and dancing.
It was the first time that I existed inside a fully-functioning self -- one that I controlled, that I steered, that I gave life to.
Because we all stem from Africa.
My desire to disappear was still very powerful.
But there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection -- and that thing is oneness, our essence.
And I've played everything from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to Secretary of State in 2004.
I give it its due.
And in that disconnected state, yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows, destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war.
It's more a reality than the ones our selves have created.
And this influenced me.
This is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and 150,000 glass beads the size of a golf ball.
And if the bus is going to stop and it's three yards away from the bus stop, you're just a prisoner.
And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open.
But instead of what it is, our focus was on the way it worked.
And so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station, our condition was that we would work with them and that, whatever we did, we were not just going to decorate a normal power station.
It has a symbolic importance.
And it's a power park.
And 250 countries all competing.
And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful, and I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like trees."
Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious, rather than looking like nuts.
So the idea was to take these 66,000 seeds that they agreed to give us, and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair and grow that through this box, very simple box element, and make it a building that could move in the wind.
We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a mini-me version of the seed cathedral, so that, even if you're partially-sighted, that it was kind of crunchy and soft, that piece of landscape that you see there.
The British government -- any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have.
And the project that we're building in Malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer.
So we're building these buildings.
TH: These are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure.
The book is called "The Blank Slate," based on the popular idea that the human mind is a blank slate, and that all of its structure comes from socialization, culture, parenting, experience.
If you've ever taken anthropology, you know that it's a -- kind of an occupational pleasure of anthropologists to show how exotic other cultures can be, and that there are places out there where, supposedly, everything is the opposite to the way it is here.
And as you can see, large amounts of the brain are not purple, showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region, so does his fraternal twin.
Now -- the story might seem to good to be true, but when you administer batteries of psychological tests, you get the same results -- namely, identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities.
And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal," he did not mean "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are clones."
"Don't expect to get any more awards, job offers or positions in scholarly societies."
Well, pretty soon they were barraged with enraged letters, death threats, ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals, coming from irate left-handers and their advocates, and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the venom and vituperation that they had inadvertently inspired.
I note that among the long list of human universals that I presented a few slides ago are art.
Serious book stores are losing their franchise, nonprofit theaters are surviving primarily by commercializing their repertory, symphony orchestras are diluting their programs, public television is increasing its dependence on reruns of British sitcoms, classical radio stations are dwindling, museums are resorting to blockbuster shows, dance is dying."
And the humanities and arts programs in the universities, which by many measures, indeed are in decline.
Barnett Newman had a famous quote that "the impulse of modern art is the desire to destroy beauty" -- which was considered bourgeois or tacky.
By the way, this is one sentence -- you can actually parse it.
Now, here is -- here is a representative quote from a besieged mother: "I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice.
Until the studies are redone with adoptive children, who provide an environment but not genes to their kids, we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid.
OK -- two different bodies of research with a similar finding.
The "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado, called Craig.
But, this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel, and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do, and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals.
"Great -- got it."
Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up.
A second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger, he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.
There's no writing, there's no scripting, there's no nonsense.
And I said, "Why would you do it this way?"
Lamb goes on the ground, lamb takes two steps, falls down, gets up, shakes a little, takes another couple steps, falls down.
He's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking.
I do.
You know, Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity.
And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia.
And this metaphor in my head -- I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin.
These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations; and I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs, I have them all the time, but that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for.
I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye, dribbling down her chin, with the steel workers.
As a group, they're the happiest people I know.
Probably the worst advice I ever got.
The guy's worth -- he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down, outside of Vegas.
That stuff -- it's suddenly all been turned on its head.
We're about 100 miles off the coast of Russia: 50-foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right?
But he looked at me, and he said, "Son" -- he's my age, by the way, he calls me son, I love that -- he says, "Son, I'm a captain of a crab boat.
I formed a theory, and I'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds.
That's what plumbers look like, right?
And right here guys, Silicon Valley, I mean -- how many people have an iPhone on them right now?
So, we've got this new toolbox, you know.
I'm talking about grandfather stuff, the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we've kind of -- you know, kind of lost a little.
And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us, but I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites.
I've got generalized anxiety disorder, which is a given.
And I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view.
And he said, "Tony's in Broadmoor."
So I said, "Yes, please."
And they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants and quite docile looking.
And I said, "So is it true that you faked your way in here?"
So I said to the psychiatrist, 'I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.'" And I said, "What else?"
I said, "How long have you been here for?"
It's just impossible."
And when I got home I emailed his clinician, Anthony Maden.
Speaks to items one and two on the checklist -- glibness, superficial charm and grandiose sense of self-worth.
So there's 1,500 people in his room.
Who cares? That's not a big story.
And I emailed him and I said, "I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you special and interested in the predatory spirit and fearless.
"You've got more sharks and you've got tigers."
He said, "Yeah, it's an amazing theory.
He said, "Well, you've got to believe in you!"
He said no to many short-term marital relationships.
We travel across the world with our notepads in our hands, and we wait for the gems.
And he said, "I'm not a psychopath."
So they let him go.
Nothing bad happened.
He's a gray area in a world that doesn't like gray areas.
You can deploy power in a wide range of ways.
And the president decided, with his advisors, to undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us.
And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle, peace, justice and equality, but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings.
That's because these are the kinds of concepts that are not susceptible to easy representation.
Some people would say that Islam means submission.
You could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago, which was fear.
And these Muslims -- and it's the vast majority of Muslims -- disagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach, profoundly.
Now, you may say, but surely, what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible with what we consider the core of democracy -- namely, free political choice, basic liberty and basic equality.
They were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there. Why?
Well, one thing is, it's not going to look identical to democracy as we know it in the United States.
And one furthermore has the impulse to generalize, as much as possible, in defining who that enemy is.
And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation, but only if we put what we can into it.
And I could not disagree more.
And the local seabird rescue center, named SANCCOB, immediately launched a massive rescue operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken.
And the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal.
Up to 1,000 people a day came to the rescue center, and eventually, over the course of this rescue, more than 12 and a half thousand volunteers came from all over the world to Cape Town to help save these birds.
We just did not know.
He said, "Okay, why don't we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled" -- they collected 20,000 -- "and we'll ship them 500 miles up the coast to Port Elizabeth in these open air trucks and release them into the clean waters there and let them swim back home."
Something else learned during the Apollo rescue was how to train the penguins to take fish freely from their hands, using these training boxes.
About a year prior to this oil spill, a 17 year-old student had invented a degreaser.
Well she could not be more wrong.
So what did I learn from this intense and unforgettable experience?
And simply put, if penguins are dying, it means our oceans are dying, and we ultimately will be affected, because, as Sylvia Earle says, "The oceans are our life-support system."
It used to look like this, and now it's more like this, with fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place.
We're doing it because we want to start a revolution.
And we said to that public meeting in Todmorden, look, let's imagine that our town is focused around three plates: a community plate, the way we live our everyday lives; a learning plate, what we teach our kids in school and what new skills we share amongst ourselves; and business, what we do with the pound in our pocket and which businesses we choose to support.
We put that proposition to the meeting, two seconds, and then the room exploded.
So we went to the doctors, said, "Would you mind us taking them up?"
And then, because we know we've got vegetable tourists and we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic, we thought, what could we do to give them an even better experience?
There's not one that we know of."
And then, we had a chat with the farmers, and we said, "We're really serious about this," but they didn't actually believe us, so we thought, okay, what should we do? I know. If we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product, maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious.
But it is joined up, and it is inclusive.
And none of this takes more money and none of this demands a bureaucracy, but it does demand that you think things differently and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs in order to create that supportive framework that communities can bounce off.
Inspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart of the town and the city plan, not relegate them to the edges of the settlements that nobody can see.
Well, this is such an honor. And it's wonderful to be in the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world.
And I was doing some rather controversial religious programs.
These doctrines seemed unproven, abstract.
What I've found, across the board, is that religion is about behaving differently.
First propounded by Confucius five centuries before Christ: "Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
He said, "In your exegesis, you must make it clear that every single verse of the Torah is a commentary, a gloss upon the Golden Rule."
So the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point, I think -- that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group: your own nation, your own co-religionists, your own fellow countrymen. You must have what one of the Chinese sages called "jian ai": concern for everybody. Love your enemies. Honor the stranger.
There's also a great deal, I think, of religious illiteracy around.
Tell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing."
Here in the United States, I think you see it in this election campaign: a longing for change.
And everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself.
And now, here's my wish: I wish that you would help with the creation, launch and propagation of a Charter for Compassion, crafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from the three Abrahamic traditions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and based on the fundamental principle of the Golden Rule.
And the Alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it.
As we go smaller, here is a human hair.
And it's looking around, and when it finds something, and recognizes it being foreign, it will actually engulf it and eat it.
So this whole world, the nano world, this area in here is called the nano world, and the nano world, the whole micro world that we see, there's a nano world that is wrapped up within that, and the whole -- and that is the world of molecules and atoms.
Here's a close-up picture, or this is actually a regular picture of a water hyacinth, and if you had really, really good vision, with your naked eye, you'd see it about that well.
You have things like coral.
So when I first looked at this, I was -- I thought, gee, this is like a little treasure trove here.
Every single grain is different. There are no two grains of sand alike in the world.
This was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing.
And that's called a ring agglutinate.
Thank you.
An infinite number of monkeys could never write the works of Shakespeare.
Astrology, for instance: like many rationalists, I'm a Pisces.
That every person here, every decision that you've made today, every decision you've made in your life, you've not really made that decision, but in fact, every single permutation of those decisions is made, each one going off into a new universe.
Well, there is one proviso.
And when we die, we don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs.
This is a terrible thing, even though I understand pain.
You may well have your own children and think, "Oh no, my child's best."
Even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse for bad housework, for instance.
For me, it's a very, very important thing.
And I realize I'm observing this with the brain, the human brain, the most complex thing in the known universe.
I can make my own purpose.
When Tony was 16 years old, one day, one moment, "It was mom's gun.
I am told every day, by every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong.
What makes something wrong?
I want to know what I know."
Turns out, Tony's got the philosophy muscle.
Thank you.
And I mean books everywhere around the house.
Now I was growing up in the late '60s and early '70s, and there were a number of other passions I was also interested in, but these two were the ones that differentiated me.
And I began to think, I wonder what it would be like to start imagining myself as if energy and information were the two things I had as input -- as if food and information were similar in some form or shape.
If you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large, you had to live with a smaller gut.
When I moved to preparation, this same thing was true, expect that there were two schools.
The same is true every time as I started thinking about information.
Clay Shirky once stated that there is no such animal as information overload, there is only filter failure.
Thank you very much for your time.
And then there's that cliché, the African dictator or minister or official.
And there's Dan Etete.
Our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in Cambodia.
And for what was then a very small organization of just a few people, trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that was an enormous challenge.
He used shell companies.
For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.
And then there's the problem of anonymous shell companies.
So we spoke to sources in country, trawled through company documents and other information trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal.
There's corruption everywhere, so why focus on that sector?
Now, that's not bad going for a convicted money launderer.
It's too complex and difficult to change.
But we're not there yet, by far.
Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure?
You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle.
In order to be secure, you defend against "them."
There are people not like you -- people who you now call enemies.
It gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them, occupy them, invade them and kill them, because they are only obstacles now to your security.
I've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world, we call Vagina Warriors.
Their own personal security is not their end goal, and because of that, because, rather than worrying about security, because the transformation of suffering is their end goal, I actually believe they are creating real safety and a whole new idea of security.
The government finally made a decision that "The Vagina Monologues" could not be performed in Uganda.
So she really struggled with this, what to do, because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together -- I believe it was 100, 150 students all wore "I love my vagina" T-shirts, and the boys wore "I love her vagina" T-shirts to school.
In the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers.
I think what I'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security, and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people, but you make yourself far more insecure.
I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa, and I had no idea where I was.
The end goal will [be] becoming vulnerable, realizing the place of our connection to one another, rather than becoming secure, in control and alone.
There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about, you know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one.
I'm used to a stationary mic.
Tell your kids.") It all sort of started as a benign mistake, like penicillin.
We bring stories to the public.
Because this is treating your audience like a moron.
No fighting, ladies.
And what I ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being.
Well, they used it.
And it's a responsibility that I don't take lightly.
Hello!
I want this book to look like it's lying to you, desperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would.
It is a haiku, if you will, of the story.
Ahh! We come upon them, the clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out.
But something is definitely lost: tradition, a sensual experience, the comfort of thingy-ness -- a little bit of humanity.
And so, we're talking about parallel planes of existence, sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers.
This debuted at number two on the New York Times Best Seller list.
Thank you.
So, as you can see evidenced by such examples, age has absolutely nothing to do with it.
Sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals can be a burden because you know that if everything were free, then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos.
Kids already do a lot of learning from adults, and we have a lot to share.
Now, adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every "don't do that, don't do this" in the school handbook to restrictions on school Internet use.
Thank you Bill Gates and thank you Ma.
Kids grow up and become adults just like you.
And in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you, remember that cloning is possible, and that involves going through childhood again, in which case you'll want to be heard just like my generation.
And so does every wild habitat on the planet, like the Amazon rainforest you're hearing behind me.
There was a time when I considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact.
The usual methods of evaluating a habitat have been done by visually counting the numbers of species and the numbers of individuals within each species in a given area.
And you can see that the signature of a stream is represented here in the bottom third or half of the page, while birds that were once in that meadow are represented in the signature across the top.
However, our ears tell us a very different story.
And when there's enough moisture in the soil in the spring, frogs will dig themselves to the surface and gather around these large, vernal pools in great numbers.
I want to end with a story told by a beaver.
But you have heard how biophonies help clarify our understanding of the natural world.
I grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in the very, very north end of it there, where it's absolutely freezing cold.
They forced us to learn things like Latin.
It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer, and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape.
We were programming in BASIC, which is a pretty awful language for games, so we ended up learning Assembly language so we could really take control of the hardware.
It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K, which was quite the leap.
Some of the highlights were things like "The Terminator," "Aladdin," the "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles."
By 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry.
All video games are violent.
You have to remember that this is not a real island.
It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it.
And this is happening in every city around the world.
Throughout human history people have played games.
You'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry?
In the year of my birth the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development.
I'm a video game addict, and it's not because of a certain number of hours I have spent playing, or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level.
Play enough video games and eventually you will really believe you can snowboard, fly a plane, drive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man.
It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional.
My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands.
Only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap in stimuli.
More beautiful and rich than the real world around us.
But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way I do.
Video games give an awful lot of other things too, and that's why people get so addicted.
As far as colleges go, there's about 350 colleges around the world teaching video game courses.
The school is closed; they're coming back at midnight because they want to pitch their video game ideas.
And as the student video showed, we can impact and move.
The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing, and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point.
And to prove it, she says, "The exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same, and I'm going to prove it to you."
And what that means: "simple and understandable" might not be actually simple or understandable, and things we think are "complex" might be made simple and understandable.
And yet, it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I'm aware of.
And I put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side, and I found that they matched up very well.
So a more direct one, one that gives you more of the feeling of math, is something closer to Pythagoras' own proof, which goes like this: so here we have this triangle, and if we surround that C square with three more triangles and we copy that, notice that we can move those triangles down like this.
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there.
And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six, where she wasn't sure what six times six was and what seven times seven was, but then she was confident again.
I'm using the software that we're putting on the $100 laptop.
Make it go in the other direction.
So if you look at the little script here, the speed is always going to be 30.
Teacher: Do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing.
AK: So obviously, Aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment, and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas.
We've done that already."
One more.
And Einstein said, "Things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler."
I'm focusing on biology, the biological sciences.
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot.
You just have to look at the Human Genome Project.
So it's not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe 30 or 40 years from now, we'll look back at this instant in time, and all of the sort of talk about the Human Genome Project, and what all this is going to mean to us -- well, it will really mean precious little.
On the way there it's going to completely revolutionize medicine and health care; that's obvious.
As an outgrowth of that, as a child of that revolution, is the revolution in biology.
And how are we going to understand all this complex information?
It's too risk-averse.
A generation or so away there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen.
What if you could take a little concoction of pharmaceuticals that would make you feel really contented, just happy to be you.
That's the focus of my book "Redesigning Humans," where I talk about the kinds of choices we'll make, and the challenges it's going to present to society.
You take a six to eight cell embryo, you tease out one of the cells, you run a genetic test on that cell, and depending on the results of that test you either implant that embryo or you discard it.
It's a joke; of course they wouldn't want to do that.
The first is that all these technologies are just a spin-off of mainstream medical research that everybody wants to see happen.
They undoubtedly will. They have.
They touch us too deeply.
It's not going to happen.
So here we are.
Where there is this bloody, awful mess happens.
It will always be remembered.
It's how we look at it.
And I said, "Yeah. You know, I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much.
I didn't know it would happen so quick, at eight.
It's our own pond. And that's how it happens."
It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park ...
Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids.
So we're driving home and she's looking out the window, and she goes, "Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street, like a man and a woman, they just started doing it. Would that ever happen?"
And then she got all caught up in the legs. "But how would the legs go, Mom?
And we watched them and I'm so thankful, because she's just like, "Wow! This is so amazing."
Thank you. I'm so happy to be here.
The thought of the surgery was not attractive.
If your high-pressure hose pipe, or your high-pressure hydraulic line, bulges a little, you just wrap some tape around the outside of it.
This is a model of my aorta.
We then use that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh, which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta.
Two hours to install one of our devices compared to six hours for the existing treatment.
And even worse, it inevitably foreshortens your life.
John Pepper there was the cardiac surgeon who did the actual work on me, but everyone else there had to contribute one way or another.
Taking the jargon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used.
Everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not assumed.
And they made extra problems for us.
They didn't understand it; they were doctors, they were next to God.
They don't want to change.
I'm sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance amongst medics, doctors, surgeons at some point.
That's all the bad news.
I'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that I'm not prepared to tell you what it cost.
And to this day, malaria takes a huge toll on our species.
Why is that?
And I think there's three main reasons why.
It's a shape-shifter, for one thing.
We could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live.
If you're poor, you're more likely to live in rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained.
We've been able to take malaria out of a society.
This has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again.
And so in her lived experience, malaria is something that comes and goes.
We've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated, it's economically challenging to deal with, and it's one for which the people who stand to benefit the most care about it the least.
And this effort well understood the economic challenge.
One WHO official at the time actually called that whole campaign "one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health."
It's treated with insecticides.
I mean, these are minor inconveniences.
And even that's probably an overestimate, because the same people who distributed the nets went back and asked the recipients, "Oh, did you use that net I gave you?"
It takes resources. It takes infrastructure.
We attacked bad roads and bad houses and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty.
You know what they say?
Yeah well, you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round, a nice round shape.
So we are bridging the digital divide.
So I was cartooning live on a wide screen -- it was quite a sensation -- and then this guy came to me.
So be careful with that Facebook account -- your momma told you, be careful.
And technology has even changed our relationship to God.
And then, of course, they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side.
Now you see me thinking at my kitchen table, and since you're in my kitchen, please meet my wife.
This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning.
The Dozo, they are the traditional hunters of West Africa.
I mean, the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided -- it was compared to the media in Rwanda before the genocide -- so imagine.
And cartoons can cross boundaries, as you have seen.
In Lebanon, it was not a book.
He has to keep his job.
Thank you.
Well, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night, and tried to write a counter-argument to it, and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable, for a planet to be an Earth, to have a place where you could probably get not just life, but complexity, which requires a huge amount of evolution, and therefore constancy of conditions.
Well, the second part of that, soon after -- and I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience, and I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth."
And if they're 50 light years away, and we call them up, and you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then 50 years later it comes back and they say, Please repeat?
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now, till we hit the second microbial age.
But what about accidental death?
And not just iridium; it's filled with glassy spherules, and it's filled with quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure: shock quartz.
But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact, so this is a type of neo-catastrophism, and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips: yes, we were hit; and yes, the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction.
And when the comet hits, the pressure produces the buckyballs, and it captures bits of the comet.
They are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these.
Fifty-five species of mammal-like reptiles.
Well, can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't?
And the what, I think, is that we returned, over and over again, to the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age, and the microbes are still out there.
Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans.
And we know who was there. At the end of the Permian, at many of these mass extinction boundaries, this is what we find: isorenieratene. It's very specific.
This isn't Volvos; this is volcanoes.
All right, what's the consequence? The oceans probably turn purple.
But the thing about this is that every once in a while we divers can run into trouble, so I'm going to do a little thought experiment here.
And we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough.
So, the temperature starts at 25 centigrade, and down it goes, down it goes.
You're in an accident. You've got two choices: you're going to die, or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and, say, 75 percent of you is saved, mentally.
How many of us flew here?
This is what Roth has found out.
One man died after working a 36-hour shift.
Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on Earth.
They're failed states.
It's definitely not a democratic state.
The main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to China because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs.
And the answer is quite simple: the Chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities, so they don't audit them.
And the real problem with the global supply chain is that it's supranational.
They can't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good.
They don't own those facilities.
And let's face it, the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in India or China has much more persuasive value than the local labor law, the local environmental regulations, the local human rights standards.
But they are extremely efficient organizations.
This is a radical proposition, and it's crazy to think that if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in Dhaka -- 22, 23, 24 dollars a month -- your best chance of enjoying rights at work is if that factory is producing for a brand name company which has got a code of conduct and made that code of conduct part of the contract.
Transparency is absolutely critical to this.
I hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and I can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs.
No.
But there are companies.
And human rights comes down to a very simple proposition: can I give this person their dignity back?
We can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped.
There is hurt, here, that cannot be fixed by Band-Aids or poetry.
But that's what the rain boots are for, because rain will wash away everything, if you let it.
And yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting, I am pretty damn naive.
Thank you.
I know that Jean-Luc Godard was right when he said that, "a good story has a beginning, a middle and an end, although not necessarily in that order."
Sometimes the only way I know how to work through something is by writing a poem.
My first spoken word poem, packed with all the wisdom of a 14-year-old, was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine.
And it was here, listening to these poets share their stories, that I learned that spoken word poetry didn't have to be indignant, it could be fun or painful or serious or silly.
And step three began when I realized that I didn't have to write poems that were indignant, if that's not what I was.
But Phil and I decided to reinvent Project V.O.I.C.E. -- this time changing the mission to using spoken word poetry as a way to entertain, educate and inspire.
And then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours.
So I assigned her list after list, and one day I assigned the list "10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now."
Somebody once told me it's like walking through life like this.
Not everyone can read music or owns a camera, but everyone can communicate in some way, and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from.
It's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself.
And I wondered whether I'd get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out, or not.
And what was left of the city soon followed.
So no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets, I keep trying, hoping that one day I'll write a poem I can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof I existed.
The only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light.
I don't know if I can change the world yet, because I don't know that much about it -- and I don't know that much about reincarnation either, but if you make me laugh hard enough, sometimes I forget what century I'm in.
I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning, and on a personal level, an awakening sense of idealism.
In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction, it becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior.
On a higher plane, the press is a service industry, and the service it provides is awareness.
The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation.
In 2001, the uprising escalated into an armed conflict, and one of the major incidents was the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank town of Jenin.
At the same time in South Africa, after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison, the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid.
In Somalia, the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out.
I also want it to be powerful and eloquent, and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the people I'm photographing.
I think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world.
This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army.
Going deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes, I worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution, where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population.
By the age of 12 or 14, they'd become beggars and drug addicts.
A hospital in Zambia.
An MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people.
I'd been photographing in the Islamic world since 1981 -- not only in the Middle East, but also in Africa, Asia and Europe.
A marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family.
After enduring extreme pain and trauma, the wounded face a grueling physical and psychological struggle in rehab.
My TED wish: there's a vital story that needs to be told, and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era.
Well unfortunately, power corrupts, and so people will do lots of things to get power and to stay in power, including doing bad things to elections.
The ballot boxes go to counting places.
And the big picture is this: elections should be verifiable.
And there's some complicated cryptography going on in there, but what's not complicated is voting with one of these forms.
And after the close of the election, you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website.
They can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one.
It's when the young couple whisper, "Tonight we are going to make a baby."
Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century?
Therefore at Gapminder we made our own map, and it looks like this.
And that is most countries in America and Europe, many countries in Africa and a few in Asia.
And indeed in 1960, you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies.
I start the world, and here we go.
We get that from the census data.
The countries which have many babies per woman here, they have quite low income.
But 30 years from now, Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million.
So what does it take?
Look at Bangladesh and Qatar.
This is a country that indeed has gone through a very, very interesting modernization.
We have reached peak child.
Each card box is one billion people.
You can see that it's like three billion missing here.
This is the great fill-up.
Thank you very much.
When I was an intern in San Francisco, I heard about a group of Native Americans who had taken over Alcatraz Island, and a Native American who wanted to give birth on that island, and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth.
This is us at the Khyber Pass, and that's our bus.
I'm going to ask you to repeat that: early detection, early response.
This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest, and to be kings and queens of the world, did not protect you from dying of smallpox.
By day nine, you look at this picture, and you're horrified.
I've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant woman.
There are 20 million people on the road at any time in buses and trains, walking, 500,000 villages, 120 million households, and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity, Shitala Mata, the cooling mother, and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the house. No incentive to report smallpox.
Every time we did a house-to-house search, we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox.
150,000 people from all over the world, doctors of every race, religion, culture and nation, who fought side by side, brothers and sisters, with each other, not against each other, in a common cause to make the world better.
Let's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about.
In 1980, Steve Jobs gave me that computer, which is Apple number 12, and it's still in Kathmandu, and it's still working, and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva.
The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response.
What do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic?
Let's assume, for example, that the first case occurs in South Asia.
But you don't get to do that usually.
And TED has flown Ron here from Ottawa, where GPHIN is located, because not only did GPHIN find SARS early, but you may have seen last week that Iran announced that they had bird flu in Iran, but GPHIN found the bird flu in Iran not February 14 but last September.
But in all seriousness -- because this idea is birthed in TED, I would like it to be a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it the "International System for Total Early Disease Detection."
Let's increase the languages they crawl from seven to 70, or more.
LB: Well, you know, as Ron St. John -- I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him -- When he started GPHIN -- In 1997, there was an outbreak of bird flu.
And because of that we were able to stop SARS.
Well, they're only crawling in seven languages.
But first, let's just take three numbers.
You can see my grandmother there.
it's about what we do right here, right now, and for the rest of our working lives.
Then they care about big issues like climate change.
We can make products that are beautiful or ugly, sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive, functional or useless.
And the best thing is, they'll also last for more than 20 years.
And this is what business needs to do: go all-in, go 100 percent, because then you stop investing in the old stuff, you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs, you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy.
It's really dirty in production.
People sometimes think that 100 percent's going to be hard, and we've had the conversation in the business.
That's about the size of Germany.
And why not take control of it ourselves?
Every business can do things like this.
I think we'd all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable.
So let's take an example, measure the things that are important in your business.
Be a discerning consumer.
So if you're a business leader, if you're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model, I'd urge you to do so.
I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses.
Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room.
She says, "Excuse me, I'm pissed off, and I know a few things, and we better get busy about them right now."
I'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing "the Other" by the voice we're giving to the most divisive among us.
This is why I'm launching a new initiative.
Anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you, or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears.
And listen.
"Like we're a bunch of elitist, morally-corrupt terrorist-lovers."
Who should you invite to lunch?
I'll meet you there."
As always, I would return to Bangalore, and often to animated discussions at friend's homes, where we would discuss various issues while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings, where a drink often cost more than what they'd paid their 14-year-old maid.
And it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible, and gives voice to people and stories without.
Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin, and they are destitute, like these young men in the image.
He begs for forgiveness, and receives it from the same woman whose brother he murdered.
Joshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind standing trial for his crimes, and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia, to an audience that often includes his victims.
This man was very drunk, and he was very interested in my camera, until he noticed the women, who handled him with smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.
I came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story.
But nonetheless, despite the hostility, firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire.
And this is something that is common to all our big cities.
And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them.
Julian Assange: Yeah, can it possibly be true?
J That's right, yeah. Very rarely do we ever know, and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible.
This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004.
J Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya, in Tanzanian and South African press.
Radio: ... just fuckin', once you get on 'em just open 'em up.
All right, we just engaged all eight individuals.
So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene.
I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst, Bradley Manning, arrested, and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you, along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables.
J Well, because these sort of things reveal what the true state of, say, Arab governments are like, the true human-rights abuses in those governments.
But are there risks with that, either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large, where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence?
Actually, they're not. My son isn't. How dare you?"
But do you see any irony in the fact that, in order for you to shine that light, you have to, yourself, create secrecy around your sources?
Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view?
And we got a report -- a sort of engineering analysis into what happened -- saying that, in fact, security guards from some rival, various competing oil firms had, in fact, parked trucks there and blown them up.
And we were like, "Oh, tell us more.
J Yeah, we have a lot, but I mean, at the moment, we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort.
Can that be right?
I mean there's like -- there's a method that can be deployed for various things.
J Yeah. And you know, I'm a combative person, so I'm not actually so big on the nurture, but some way -- there is another way of nurturing victims, which is to police perpetrators of crime.
Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy.
When you think of the future then, do you think it's more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control, more secrecy, or us watching Big Brother, or it's just all to be played for either way?
Every single bead, every single colored band, represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note.
These clipboards are filled with numbers.
These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data.
And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it.
You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture.
Lauren Hodge: If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option, which would you choose, grilled or fried chicken?
And as you can see, none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe, which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet.
So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis, saying that, could possibly the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade and could it be due to the differences in PH?
The final stages, when I ran the samples through a high-pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer, which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had in my chicken.
Based on these findings, I have a question for you.
And she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you that little kids will eat their vegetables if they're different colors.
So, armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology, I decided I wanted to do cancer research at 15.
One in 100 will die from it.
And we wanted to figure this out, because if we could figure that out, then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening.
And that's huge.
It was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing.
It confused me; why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season?
They're everywhere.
So Julie's going to her doctor's office to get treated for her asthma.
In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph, it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate, what her exhalation rate or lung health, should be based on her age, gender and height.
But before I end my talk today, I want to leave you with one saying.
Lisa Ling: Right.
But, of course, that's the point.
And other things that I don't -- aren't familiar with.
At the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.
Curious encounters were happening to me at the time; I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world.
I mean, people -- Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.
It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look, and look a little longer, and maybe even understand.
Then another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah -- a little homage to my life as an athlete.
Her mouth dropped open when she saw me, and she went, "But you're so tall!"
It's a conversation about augmentation.
Thank you.
Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle -- a 50-some year-old woman, a vegetable vendor in Shanghai, who loves singing Western opera, but she didn't understand any English or French or Italian, so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese.
But I think being different is good, because you present a different point of view.
The producer told us they were looking for some sweet, innocent and beautiful fresh face.
And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people.
But then sometimes I'm thinking, what are today's young generation up to?
So far, as of today, we know that she herself made up that title -- probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity.
On Tencent, 200 million.
That could pose a potential danger to the society, but who knows; we're in a globalized world, so they can look for girlfriends from other countries.
In urban areas, college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month, while the average rent is above $500.
Last year, though, an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China: 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide, just one by one like causing a contagious disease.
Now it's 0.5 -- even worse than that in America -- showing us the income inequality.
So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet, people cry for the government to take actions to stop this.
While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making, but sometimes they're a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life.
It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding, but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house, without a car, without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet, to show their commitment to true love.
Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values, but also, it's about the environment.
And my passion was inspired at the age of seven, when my parents first took me to Morocco, at the edge of the Sahara Desert.
In Nature's Great Events, a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough, we wanted to do just that.
To find food, mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast, where the snow will already be melting.
And that sequence was especially difficult.
In 2005, a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of Ecuador.
This two-and-a-half-inch bat has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue, the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world.
And one remote location -- I first went there as a backpacker; I've been back several times for filming, most recently for Untamed Americas -- it's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America, and it's the most otherworldly place I know.
Where deserts freeze and waters boil.
So, here's the first story.
Now, this is the picture I want you to focus on.
Never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated.
And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone to say these airplanes were trespassing.
And in 1939, a lawyer, Sydney Kaye, started something called Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI.
Digital technology is the opportunity for the revival of these vocal chords that he spoke so passionately to Congress about.
This one you should be -- confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry.
I want to share all my love with you ...
Because, of course, every technique that you've seen here is something that television and film producers have been able to do for the last 50 years.
Every single use therefore requires permission; without permission, you are a trespasser.
Looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense.
Now, I would talk about one particular such plan that I know something about, but I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling, so I'm not going to talk about this at all.
We can't stop our kids from using it.
Do better, at least for them, if not for opening for business.
Every life form on this planet -- every insect, every bacteria, every plant, every animal, every human, every politician -- is coded in that stuff.
And we could start dating things, and we could start changing medicine and archeology.
And in the measure that we map ourselves, this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on.
And the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much, except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters, which is what makes you you, as far as gene code inside each of your cells, and this little amoeba which, you know, sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions, turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside.
Because if you can live in radiation that looks like this, that brings up a whole series of interesting questions.
This is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma.
And you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gar.
And if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg, we may give birth to an animal that hasn't walked the earth since 1936.
Takes about 3 million dollars the second time.
This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk.
This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes.
And you are likely to be wandering around -- and your children -- on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time, in some places in the world where they don't stop the research.
Right? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but...
That's what your genes are doing every day.
It won't do anything for you.
So, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months and the power doubles, right?
So, this is what a new map of the world looks like.
And that's the triangle between Salk, Scripps, UCSD, and it's called Torrey Pines Road.
So, if there is something you should fear, it's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball.
Here's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent.
They didn't keep the people who were educated.
And this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.
So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it?
So they get tired, has come dark and rain; they get weary and tired.
Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar.
Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha!
Truth number one about lying: Lying's a cooperative act.
Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the United States.
He was interviewed once, and he said the following.
And boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies.
Extroverts lie more than introverts.
We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives.
Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language?
One-year-olds learn concealment.
Well there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass.
Bill Clinton: I want you to listen to me.
Studies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather than informal language.
We all chatter with our fingertips.
Well guess what, they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth.
Can you tell what's happening in a conversation?
They're going to be infuriated if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course of the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview.
We say "yes," we shake our heads "no."
So I know it's not possible.
Now with anger, you've got two people on an even playing field.
Science has surfaced many, many more indicators.
We make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long.
And these were surfaced by researcher David Matsumoto in California.
PM: Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother, Erin Runnion, confronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court.
And these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove incredibly useful some day.
Our manic tweeting and texting can blind us to the fact that the subtleties of human decency -- character integrity -- that's still what matters, that's always what's going to matter.
I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago, and a Nigerian journalist comes -- and this will only make sense if you've ever watched a James Bond movie -- and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes, "Aha, we meet again, Mr. Bond!"
I'm a writer, and I've been watching people with the slide shows and scientists and bankers, and I've been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah.
So if news is anything to go by, the U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe, right?
It comes from popular culture.
Giraffes are this desire in the dark."
This is good, because language complicates things.
Nigeria got its independence in 1960.
If she does it again tomorrow, I'm going to throw myself off this building and kill myself."
In fact, every time I read in Ireland, people get me all mistaken and they say, "Oh, this is Chris O'Barney from Cork."
Story is powerful.
I grew up very privileged, and it's important to talk about privilege, because we don't talk about it here.
All of those are gone.
And as Idris moves, Fraser screams, "Stop!
This is a redemption we can all aspire to.
And I asked millions of people, without questioning my right to do so, to go up against the government.
But this is a good thing.
I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this, that we can rise above all of this.
It's called "Ode to the Drum," and I'll try and read it the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.
Brass nails tacked into the ebony wood, your face has been carved five times.
I'm a, or was, or kind of am a toy designer.
I'm in my garage, making weird stuff.
This, now that's the McNugget maker, and this is a -- this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie.
This is some effects that I did for "Wig, Rattle and Roll."
This is a-- we're doing some flight-testing on my little pug, seeing if this can really grab.
And you know, Lego -- don't take Legos to Lego.
That's my youngest cousin.
And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there.
OK, so, so that was a, that was the first kind of a -- that was the first batch of products.
And so, art and science have a kind of dynamic balance, that's where I think innovation happens.
So by way of showing you this, you can kind of get an understanding of what it is to, hopefully, try to create robotic life forms, or technology that has an emotional connection with the user.
A little, tiny guy walks along. More servo drives, lots of servo hacking, lots of mechanical stuff.
So it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company.
So there's some real pseudo-code over here, and getting the idea of different kind of drives, things like that.
There's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff.
And there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby.
And I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there.
And there he is, a little bush baby on -- caught in the headlights there.
And so Dave and I got working.
And the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard.
For a while, they were making two million Furbys a month.
And she still actually has those.
Not a robot that kind of does, but let's really go for it.
And then I went in, and measured all the geometry because I figured, hey, biomimicry.
Here's some SLA parts of the same thing.
There was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right.
Now you start doing the sculpture for this.
This -- I on purpose -- they go through life stages.
So you see -- hey, come on. Hey, did you feel that?
That's what the investors think, that it's just -- -- right, right. So they're really sweet little guys.
We did include some things that are hopefully useful.
We have one animator who's taken it and he's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial, and they're going, "Whassup," you know?
One of my favorite parts of my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world, and I do that quite regularly.
And so when I come back from these trips, and I'm thinking about development, and I'm flying home and I'm thinking, "We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations," you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder: how is it that they can get Coke to these far-flung places?
I feel that, if we can understand what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous, we can apply those lessons then for the public good.
They have this very continuous feedback loop.
I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark.
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that.
The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic, they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.
In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program.
So, they rely on Coca-Cola in terms of its marketing, and what's the secret to their marketing?
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it, "Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.
"Use a condom, don't get AIDS."
But what we're finding around the world, over and over again, is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there, it doesn't get used.
And it works -- look at these headlines.
Can you you believe that?
So if you look back to 1988, there are about 350,000 cases of polio on the planet that year.
On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample, and by the 25th of August, it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.
So in less than a month, we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program.
So we are 99 percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money.
Thank you.
So, probably, what Joe would see would be in this part, in the greenish part of the picture.
Most of the reefs are dead, most of the corals are dead -- overgrown by algae -- and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them.
And many people think this is really, really beautiful, if this is your baseline.
Most of the biomass is low on the food chain, the herbivores, the parrotfish, the surgeonfish that eat the algae.
We have more sharks, more biomass of snappers, more biomass of herbivores, too, like these parrot fish that are like marine goats.
In Christmas, where the food web is really trimmed down, where the large animals are gone, the corals have not recovered.
We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming.
And this is what I saw, lots of fish.
The size of organisms increases a third, so your fish are now this big.
Outside the reserve, you cannot even detect this.
Reserves are like savings accounts.
This is grouper sex, and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week.
Now, if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut, if we brought just 20 divers one month per year, the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time.
Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices.
The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people, where there is no social conflict, where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low.
So the solutions are just fixing these three issues.
The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going.
That's basically it.
What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti, with five lions per wildebeest.
We've got 19 billion to spend on health care or something.
We go there to try to understand the ecosystems, to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know.
We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen, and we're not going to show you any of it.
Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea, at the bottom of the sea.
It's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.
And it's got these jet thrusters up in front that it'll use in a moment, and a little light.
You hear about giant squid and things like that, but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long.
In this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.
We're going to take a joystick, sit in front of our computer, on the Earth, and press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.
We're getting down further and further in scale.
And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed, hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor.
On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps, so the setting here is very dramatic.
And you can see how dense the population is.
So, as soon as a crab touches them, they retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails.
There are never any lights there, except the lights that we bring.
You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here, and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack!
Those are all shrimp.
It's how they find the hydrothermal vents.
So all of these are individual homes for worms.
It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid, and it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates.
BL: The biologists right now cannot explain why these animals are so active.
Is it fragile? No, it's not really very fragile.
What we're learning now, it's almost like a symphony.
Thank you.
To start with, I'd like to break math down into two categories.
One is a lack of initiative; your students don't self-start.
He called it, "an impatience with irresolution."
Notice, first of all here, that you have exactly three pieces of information there, each of which will figure into a formula somewhere, eventually, which the student will then compute.
Here's a really cool problem. I like this.
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students, we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving.
And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.
The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.
And that question, off this right here, is really fun for me because, like the intro, I teach kids -- because of my inexperience -- I teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?
And that's terrifying, because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition, that's great, but it's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical.
It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap, and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.
So I just really encourage you, whatever your stake is in education -- whether you're a student, parent, teacher, policy maker, whatever -- insist on better math curriculum.
You know when the Large Hadron Collider started, and it didn't work, and people tried to work out why, it was the Small Hadron Collider team who sabotaged it because they were so jealous.
The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate, but by golly, they are qualified.
We'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year for the next 30 years.
And Juanderson, instead, went into what provided kind of opportunity and hope in the place that he lived, which was the drugs trade.
This is Kibera, which is the largest slum in East Africa.
And the education they got was pitiful.
If you want to design from scratch virtually any service in Africa, you would start now with the mobile phone.
This is a private school.
What do they look like?
Most of our education system is push.
What does that?
This is an amazing guy, Sebastiao Rocha, in Belo Horizonte, in the third largest city in Brazil.
Taio Rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning.
It has 30,000 children on those building sites.
Here, there isn't really an option.
He's a complete revolutionary.
And Madhav said, "Why do we have to do it that way?
So mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the 19th century.
There's sustaining innovation, which will sustain an existing institution or an organization, and disruptive innovation that will break it apart, create some different way of doing it.
They're recognizably schools, but they look different.
You need efforts to supplement schools.
But it is, unlike cars, which have developed so rapidly and orderly, actually the school system is recognizably an inheritance from the 19th century, from a Bismarkian model of German schooling that got taken up by English reformers, and often by religious missionaries, taken up in the United States as a force of social cohesion, and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed.
That is why we need really radical thinking, and why radical thinking is now more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn.
And as I'm watching it, I'm realizing that they're talking about me.
When I finally got to a place in my life where I came out and accepted who I was, and was really quite happy, to tell you the truth, I was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too.
I drink coffee.
Any parents out there of teenagers? All we do is cook for these people -- they eat two, three, four dinners a night -- it's ridiculous!
He was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me, but he told me that when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with, they present them with a pebble -- the perfect pebble.
Because I, too, am in love, and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about.
It's wonderful.
When you get in front of this crowd, you're gonna share the news.
The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda.
Did you know in the states where there's no shading that you can be fired for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?
The people that, we say, knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution -- the gay agenda, if you will.
He has a 4.0.
It's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am that I am disqualified for any sort of adoption.
Look to your right.
How about this week?
Harriet's paying attention to her energy use, and she is decidedly not an energy geek.
So the question is, how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we're using, and start wasting less of it?
They had zero impact on energy consumption.
In fact, it already is.
Now, the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours, but for the rest of us, two terawatt hours is more than enough energy to power every home in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined for more than a year.
That's 40 billion -- with a B -- every year in the U.S. alone.
Utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy.
She asked me what I did for a living, and I told her, I work with utilities to help people save energy.
There are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question.
That's the metaphor, the old metaphor.
And I have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging is a staircase -- the upward ascension of the human spirit, bringing us into wisdom, wholeness and authenticity.
As I was approaching my late 40s, when I would wake up in the morning my first six thoughts would all be negative.
I don't want to romanticize aging.
Myself included.
It's a terrible disease. It's fatal.
Perhaps our parents suffered from depression.
And I realized that, in order to know where I was going, I had to know where I'd been.
It wasn't your fault; you're just fine.
What determines our quality of life is how we relate to these realities, what kind of meaning we assign them, what kind of attitude we cling to about them, what state of mind we allow them to trigger."
It helps us become what we might have been.
Older women are the largest demographic in the world.
And the answer of course, like so many things in the world, is sex.
And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants.
Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid.
And this is the mimic.
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.
And this one doesn't have anything for them.
They fly in and they pollinate.
This thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing.
And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals.
And the plant showers them with pollen, and off they go and pollinate.
So what is an insect seeing?
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind.
I think there's something poetic here, that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter, the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus.
This is one my partner and I worked on.
And this is when the Americans beat the Russians, and this was -- yes, it was technically a game.
I mean, there's education, and then there's the Red Sox, and we know where they're stacked.
And he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself, and you can see here he's got Zig's Indian Reservation. And this particular shot, this is one of the more traditional shots. This is a rain dancer.
It baffles the mind. And so Zig, being Indian, likewise it baffles his mind. His favorite photograph -- my favorite photograph of his, which I don't have in here is Indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of Indians.
So she proceeded to tell me, and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here.
So I said, "Yeah, you can play a game," and I give her a bunch of these, and I tell her to paint them in different families. These are pictures of Maezza when she was — God, it still chokes me up seeing these.
And she -- just the look on her face came over and she said -- now mind you this is after a month of -- this is Black History Month, right?
It wasn't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie.
I made another game called Train.
Like, here's the economics of illegal immigration.
So I think data can actually make us more human.
Followed by that, you see on the West coast planes moving across, the red-eye flights to the East coast.
You can see this is a major shipping airport, and there's all kinds of activity there.
I started taking a look as well at different perimeters, because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data.
And it had a live feed with a 24-hour offset, so you could see the changing relationship and some demographic info coming through AT&amp;T's data and revealing itself.
And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases.
The nerdy side of me thought, "Wow, this is amazing.
And I started collecting sheep.
So here's a few statistics from the project.
And I think it's a pretty valid question.
And I like that.
So we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces, and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk.
And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces.
So we resynthesized this song.
And this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions.
You mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video?"
And I met a music video director named Chris Milk.
So what we did was cross-cut a bunch of archival footage of Johnny Cash, and at eight frames a second, we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically changing music video.
Collaborator Four: I've seen everybody from Japan, Venezuela, to the States, to Knoxville, Tennessee.
And below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project.
And you can sort the video a number of different ways.
What if we had a very low commitment, but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed?
I cut stories.
But I was also a rebel.
And I chose the language of silhouette because graphically it's very efficient.
They can be with words or without words.
So one of these works is the "Spelling Spider."
So the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image, so it makes a very freestyle architecture.
So what if we were living in balloon houses?
I have some stories that are humorous, like "Dead Beats."
I call them Freudian cities.
"FeliCity."
Larger images, I started to run marathons.
And I call it "Hells and Heavens" because it's daily hells and daily heavens.
And in papercutting, you have the drawing as the structure itself.
It's one I'm wearing and one that's on exhibition at the Center for Books Arts in New York City.
And I entered competitions for a long time.
So for the subway in New York, I saw a correspondence between riding the subway and reading.
So the technique, it's cut, sandblasted, etched and printed glass into architectural glass.
But you have a bonus with this bench.
And sometimes it's about a legacy of the neighborhood, like in Morrisania, about the jazz history.
So I can call it techno-crafted.
And in all these universes, it's like imagination is the vehicle to be transported with, but the destination is our minds and how we can reconnect with the essential and with the magic.
One of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs.
A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are.
And that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods.
There are other reasons -- there are other reasons why it's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before.
There is one really big problem with this, and that problem is envy.
She comes from an odd place.
It's made to feel, by magazines and other media outlets, that if you've got energy, a few bright ideas about technology, a garage, you too could start a major thing.
Everybody, all politicians on Left and Right, agree that meritocracy is a great thing, and we should all be trying to make our societies really, really meritocratic.
It's no longer the gods, it's us. We're in the driving seat.
This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to, I think it's a crazy idea, completely crazy.
It's not the post that should count.
There is another source of solace and comfort for all this.
Now is there any alternative to this?
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.
And I think that is the message of tragedy to us, and why it's so very, very important, I think.
We've slightly lost the habit of doing that, which is, I think, why we're particularly drawn to nature.
My own theory of success -- and I'm somebody who is very interested in success. I really want to be successful.
Thing about a successful life is, a lot of the time, our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own.
So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success, but we should make sure that they are our own.
Thank you very much.
Because otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic.
Alain de Botton.
Just why, why didn't I do it better? Why? Why? Why?
It's daunting.
It's an arduous, difficult sport, and I don't remember smiling at any time during this sport.
Try going in with an armada like we had of 50 people and five boats and CNN's crew, etc.
And I gathered together, honestly, the world's leading experts in every possible way.
And I had all kinds of counting systems ready there in English, followed by German, followed by Spanish, followed by French.
Is there an edge?
First of all, you're going to hit obstacles.
And I was on fire -- excruciating, excruciating pain.
I feel it in the back and then I feel it in the chest up here, and I can't breathe.
My breath is down to three breaths a minute.
And I swam through the night and I swam through the next day.
The devastation of those stings had taken the respiratory system down so that I couldn't make the progress I wanted.
As a matter of fact, the best advice I got was from an elementary school class in the Caribbean.
He said, "You know those guys who really believe in what they believe in and so they wear bombs?"
I finished the swim like this.
I can feel proud. I can stand here in front of you tonight and say I was courageous.
And I don't want to be the crazy woman who does it for years and years and years, and tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails, but I can swim from Cuba to Florida, and I will swim from Cuba to Florida.
And by the way, a reporter called me the other day and he said he looked on Wikipedia and he said he saw my birthday was August 22nd 1949, and for some odd reason in Wikipedia, they had my death date too.
Live it large. Live it large.
And, as a cardiologist, to think that you could see in real time a patient, an individual, anywhere in the world on your smartphone, watching your rhythm -- that's incredible, and it's with us today.
Right now, they are under the skin, but in the future, they won't have to be implanted.
And this is ability, in real time, to actually take measurements of caloric intake as well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid.
You can put it on for two weeks and send it in the mail.
This is me now. And you can see the ECG.
And in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay for a Medicare greater than 65 years or older, is -- 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days, and by six months, over 56 percent are readmitted.
And this one, which is really telling, this was from July, this cover article: "The personal metrics movement goes way beyond diet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet of life, from sleep to mood to pain, 24/7/365."
However you have to put in most of this stuff.
Furthermore it says, "Start time."
It's usually 90 percent. So, you tell me you sleep better than expected.
"Eric, I want to talk. I want to talk."
And really interesting stuff.
But of course we have a way to measure that now on a continuous basis, with a sensor that detects blood glucose, and it's important because we could detect hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known, and also hypoglycemia.
Depression, there's a great approach to that in mood disorders.
One of many different techniques using wireless sensors.
Their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible, and this is really a nonprofit education center which is just about to open. It looks like this, this whole building dedicated.
We can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation.
It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height and it's hyper-innovative, and I think it represents the black swan of medicine.
One nice problem is, what do we do about health?
Well, the single best way is to get them to understand that what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense.
Or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it.
Timesharing is a little further off in the future.
The plot of the book is that there's not enough diversity, so that the people who designed the city make sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created.
And nobody knows how hard that is, but we'll probably find out in a few years.
And so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes, we can live 200 years.
And one of the things Laurie Garrett pointed out, and others have, is that a society that doesn't have people of working age is in real trouble. And things are going to get worse, because there's nobody to educate the children or to feed the old.
Emotion is not something added to thought. An emotional state is what you get when you remove 100 or 200 of your normally available resources.
Thank you.
In the last 20 years, people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food.
In order to learn them, you have to go work in those restaurants.
Then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact.
We discovered why woks are the shape they are.
Here's our hamburger cutaway.
Most of the characteristic char-grilled taste doesn't come from the wood or the charcoal.
We cut a $5,000 restaurant oven in half.
So it's very much like in a Hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air, supported by wires, and then they take the wires away digitally so you're flying through the air.
In addition to cutaways, we also explain physics.
It's a little couple paragraphs to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt, and where he got his inspiration.
So that's the place where you really want to cook.
Here's the final hamburger.
We have a very high-speed camera, which we had lots of fun with on the book.
The other amazing thing is, when this ballistics gelatin comes down, it falls back down as a nice block.
But you need to talk about surgical instruments and the evolution of surgical technology together.
He's got some seizure disorder. And you don't understand this.
We really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery.
Surgeons still had a bit of a PR problem, because the landscape was dominated by the itinerant barber surgeon.
With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler at the Mass. General in 1847, a whole new era of surgery was ushered in.
Joseph Lister was aepsis's, or sterility's, biggest advocate, to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons.
Transplantation: you could take an organ out of one person, you could put it in another person, and it would work.
We bring instruments in, from two separate cuts in the side, and then you can start manipulating tissue.
This surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience.
And now, in contrast to the laparoscopy, you can precisely place the needle in your instruments, and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory.
And you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside.
But there are other barriers.
And for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren't being done with the da Vinci.
Ready? So here it comes.
For the patient, however, it's transparent. This is all they're going to see.
And so what we're starting to do is we're starting to inject specially designed markers into the bloodstream that will target the cancer.
And we don't even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision.
And we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards.
Because facing your own mortality causes a re-evaluation of priorities, and a realignment of what your goals are in life, unlike anything else.
You know, Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family.
This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had.
Too much rain falls on some areas, and not enough on others.
You know, commonality, the first line in Charles' narration was, "The same stars that shine down on Russia shine down on the United States. From the sky, our cities look much the same."
But it's not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman.
So those are cool images. But these are ones I think are really cool.
But you know the object is just a pivot.
Because it just kind of, you know, doesn't get any more basic than that.
But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process, which was incredibly important to them.
Charles and Ray, they didn't obsess about style for it's own sake.
Here's a film we've been hearing things about.
ED: You've seen that film, and what's so great about this whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale.
Design was not something other.
Upper left is a film they did on toy trains.
Lucia angel, okay, eye.
Citizen Kane, rose -- Audience: Rosebud.
It's sort of an alternative universe.
Girl: Y-I-N-D-I-A-N-A.
They have trading cards and all sorts of cool things.
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition.
It wasn't like "Oh, we made some chairs and got successful.
And those a little bit up the scale eat off of a sort of a low-fired ceramic dish.
And I think that in these times when we fall back and regroup, that somehow or other, the banana leaf parable sort of got to get working there, because I'm not prepared to say that the banana leaf that one eats off of is the same as the other eats off of.
And I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey.
And I'm going to admit to hubris.
I went to five countries around the world.
This is not about lousy marriages, this is not about jobs that suck.
It's a pretty harrowing linkage between what's happening to our environment and what's happening to our human rights.
But that doesn't make you a slave either.
They said, "That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious, but my children were hungry.
I just want to share a little clip for you.
If you look at a long-term chart, prices are at historical lows and yet global demand for forced labor is still real strong.
MO: We're recommending to our clients a buy and hold strategy.
Capital purchase items.
There are no roads there, so they carry loads of stone on their backs, often of their own weight, up and down the Himalaya Mountains.
This is not James, this is one of the kids that he works with.
Now, if we do that, if we put the resources and the focus to it, what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery?
A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery, about 400 dollars.
And the great thing about it is that it's not money down a hole, there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery to work for themselves, are they motivated?
This is what liberation really looks like.
She said, "No, because we've got hope now.
Okay, thank you so much.
All I mean is, is that early childhood education can bring more and better jobs to a state and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the state's residents.
My argument is essentially that early childhood programs can do exactly the same thing, create more and better jobs, but in a different way.
And the trouble with that objection, it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent.
One of the very interesting facts is that, in addition, we find that even once we hold constant, statistically, the effect of your own education, the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages.
I can be the most skilled person in the world, but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills, my employer is going to find it more difficult to introduce new technology, new production techniques.
And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and be worried these little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes.
There's a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy, and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy, and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar, we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy.
And, of course, as I mentioned, this cost has corresponding benefits.
Now one response you can make to this, and I sometimes have done this in talks, is people can talk about, there are benefits for these programs in reducing special ed and remedial education costs, there are benefits, parents care about preschool, maybe we'll get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool, and I think those are true, but in some sense they're missing the point.
So I think the research evidence on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is extremely strong.
The first is zero electrical resistance, and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.
But not here, because it is a quantum effect.
In this movie here, you can see how they flow one by one discretely.
I have here a superconductor, which I wrapped up so it'd stay cold long enough.
Why? Because as long as it rotates, the locking is maintained.
And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight.
Now, while I'll let it circulate for a little more, let me tell you a little bit about superconductors.
This two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms, a small car, in my hand.
But he didn't have Wikipedia.
And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it.
Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up.
But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower.
And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto, which is in Portugal.
And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the PR office at BP that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil.
So kind of out of desperation, I decided that I could think laterally.
And that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill.
Kew Gardens were insistent that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree.
But the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies.
That's a billion-fold increase in capability per dollar that we've actually experienced since I was a student.
It's really any technology where we can measure the underlying information properties.
The Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression.
Look at this graph here.You could buy one transistor for a dollar in 1968.
We actually ship more than twice as much of every form of information technology.
Because if you double one percent seven more times, which is exactly what happened, you get 100 percent. And the project was finished on time.
Spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.
And we're only eight doublings away from it meeting 100 percent of our energy needs.
It's backed by NASA and Google, and other leaders in the high-tech and science community.
Here is our founding meeting.
This was in an area called Wellawatta, a prime residential area in Colombo.
I turned around to check on my friend's house.
He said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach, and that he would rather die there than run.
When what was a tranquil sea swallows up people, homes and long-tail boats -- mercilessly, without warning -- and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming, I'm not sure you'd want to calm down either.
Having this news was comforting in some small way to understand what had just happened to us.
Voice 1: Yeah. It's coming again.
And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected writers, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us.
One of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically, and, of course, the Internet more generally -- and it's going to seem like a very obvious point, but I think it is an important one to think about -- is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content every day, who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing, linking, commenting on the substance of the Internet, are doing so primarily for free.
So, I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational, and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money, or, you have to pay for it to be good, but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products without any money at all changing hands.
It would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of beans in the jar, and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you.
But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there, and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it.
But there's also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side, in fact -- and that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other, the harder it is for each of us to remain independent.
And networks make it harder for people to do that, because they drive attention to the things that the network values.
So, the ant colony is a great model: you have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing.
There, you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself.
And literally, this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said, "I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids that'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table, they'll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one, and they'll be able to know the difference without looking at it."
I got a day job, and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like, let's supply water to the world, and power to the world, and educate all the kids, which, Chris, I will not talk about. I don't need another mission.
We said, we're going to build a device that does what he wants.
So I'm going to show you now, without the skin on it, a 30-second piece, and then I'm done.
Going to scratch his nose.
In addition to that, it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth, and much of it we don't know about.
And so 10 years ago, an international program began called the Census of Marine Life, which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans.
And the limiting step here wasn't the unknown diversity of life, but rather the taxonomic specialists who can identify and catalog these species that became the limiting step.
If you were to go out there today, 20 years after this fishery collapsed, if you could catch a fish, which would be a bit of a challenge, it would be half that size still.
So fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day.
Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one.
And I want to start with a bit on technology, because, of course, this is a TED Conference and you want to hear something on technology.
And the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water, unlike light.
And so from that we can produce these tracks.
Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding.
The Ocean Biogeographic Information System is the database for all the census data.
So even after a 10-year census, there are large areas that still remain unexplored.
Where do we find the most species of ocean life?
For example, while it's hard to believe that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists, it did until a few years ago when South African fishermen requested an export permit and scientists realized that this was something new to science.
If we look at distributions, in fact distributions change dramatically.
But the really interesting thing about it is that, a few years ago, census scientists discovered that this guy can thrive in oxygen-poor sediments in the deep Mediterranean Sea.
So even new environments are still within the domain of the discoverable.
But the fishes, as I say, are the best known.
And these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece.
And so as we see in this image of light during the night, there are lots of areas of the Earth where human development is much greater and other areas where it's much less, but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean.
Ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with, as well as ocean warming, and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs.
And as the oceans go so shall we.
Why grow homes? Because we can.
We use CNC to make scaffolding to train semi-epithetic matter, plants, into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.
And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs.
We had a big show in Prague, and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat.
One of the most impressive things about what some, perhaps 10, of the speakers have been talking about is the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying: Well, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do.
Well, it reminds me a little bit of surgery.
But what it means in the original Indo-European is a change in direction, going in a different way.
I interrupted, and I said, "Did you say this?"
Some of you have felt it in laboratories; some of you have felt it at the workbench.
And here's what he says, roughly translated: A man -- generic man -- a man, to be greatly good, must imagine clearly.
So, if we are to be the world's healer, every disadvantaged person in this world -- including in the United States -- becomes our patient.
We are, should be, morally committed to being the healer of the world.
We have seen that here today with the sense, with the sensitivity -- and in the last three days, and with the power of the indomitable human spirit.
We have a brain for one reason and one reason only, and that's to produce adaptable and complex movements.
Now for those who don't believe this argument, we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain, but the clinching evidence is this animal here -- the humble sea squirt.
And the answer is we're doing extremely poorly; it's a very hard problem.
There's no competition at all.
So this is the end of a Ph.D. project from one of the best robotics institutes.
It's a high school sport where you have 12 cups you have to stack and unstack against the clock in a prescribed order.
So one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is, for example, sensory feedback is extremely noisy.
And more than that, the outside world, or task, is both ambiguous and variable.
And the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions.
And the key idea to Bayesian inference is you have two sources of information from which to make your inference.
And what it really says, and what you want to estimate, is the probability of different beliefs given your sensory input.
And what Bayes' rule says is that I should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow, which have the ellipses, and that's my belief.
And moreover, it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do.
Well why would I bother doing that?
So one way to reconstruct that is to compare the prediction -- which is only based on your movement commands -- with the reality.
So we can bring the experiments of the 21st century by applying robotic technologies to this problem.
The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle.
So we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena.
So they actually think they've hit the person less hard than they have -- rather like the tickling.
And we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers for three seconds and then it stops.
And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this -- a 70 percent escalation in force on each go.
So think about just a point to point movement.
Now this is a bunch of dots moving.
And perhaps in life, movements get better through learning.
If I choose a different way of moving -- on the right for example -- then I'll have a different command, different noise, playing through a noisy system, very complicated.
And it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that.
DW: No, no, actually I think they're all important to drive the right movement behavior to get reproduction in the end.
I want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history in 18 minutes.
I believe that Mars is the most likely target for life outside the Earth.
And yes, the red planet is red.
This is 2,000 miles across.
Is there water on Mars?
Water is the key ingredient in the evolution, the origin of life on a planet.
Mars had rivers, Mars had lakes, but more important Mars had planetary-scale oceans.
The most intriguing and puzzling measurement, in my opinion, we've obtained of Mars, was released earlier this year in the magazine Science.
The oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion.
This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix, we just put two years ago.
What is the best way to unravel the mysteries on Mars that exist?
This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center.
This is what ARES looks like as it flies over Mars.
The problem is the spacecraft's largest diameter is nine feet; ARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.
This is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to Mars.
Practice makes perfect.
This is over Tilamook, Oregon.
This is the ARES team; we have about 150 scientists, engineers; where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this.
Started out with my then four-year-old: "Oh, should buy the kid some Lego.
The dining room looked like this.
I was like, "Yeah.
And then someone built this -- this is the Smith Tower in Seattle.
I'm kind of into this stuff, and I'm going to stop being embarrassed."
I love the guy who's like running away with his clasps, his hooks.
And then, just some examples. This stuff really is sculpture.
Let's see here.
She said, "I agree with everything that's been said.
Because the more we learned, the more concerned we grew.
They painted the roofs of all their stores white.
And they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains, 60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country, it would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China.
65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year.
It's hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know?
At the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about what the action items would be, how we'd follow up.
Because California was the first state in this country to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020.
He told us that Brazil's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol.
It's created a million jobs inside that country, and it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial.
Well, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa.
Don't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal.
In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars.
So, in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises.
To size the problem, China's CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons; the U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means we'll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050.
Well, I'll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green -- is bigger than the Internet.
And the most important thing you can do, I think, is to use your personal power and your Rolodex to lead your business, your institution, in going green.
And the kind of social network I'm talking about is not the recent online variety, but rather, the kind of social networks that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years, ever since we emerged from the African savannah.
So one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics.
So, as all of you probably know, the classic way of thinking about this is the diffusion-of-innovation, or the adoption curve.
Because, as I said, we live our lives in networks, and these networks have a particular kind of a structure.
Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers, or by their neighbors.
Nicholas Christakis: B, it's obvious.
On the left-hand panel, again, we have the S-shaped curve of adoption.
So, how can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network?
And that happens at every peripheral node.
So the random group is in the red line.
So this would be a technique whereby we could get more than a month-and-a-half warning about a flu epidemic in a particular population.
So bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu.
And by behaviors, I can mean things like criminal behavior, or voting behavior, or health care behavior, like smoking, or vaccination, or product adoption, or other kinds of behaviors that relate to interpersonal influence.
They are surrounded by immunized people.
If we could understand how to target, it could affect the efficiency of what we're trying to achieve.
Because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom, but where everyone is, and what they're thinking based on what they're uploading on the Internet, and what they're buying based on their purchases.
And there are three ways, I think, that these massive-passive data can be used.
It's sort of like when Galileo invented -- or, didn't invent -- came to use a telescope and could see the heavens in a new way, or Leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope -- or actually invented -- and could see biology in a new way.
But over the course of several years, I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's CCTV building in Beijing and the olympic stadium in the same city by the architects Herzog and de Meuron.
There's only one little entrance to the entire building, and the 3,000 residents come in and out through that single door.
The inventive inhabitants, for instance, find opportunities in the most unexpected cases, like the adjacent parking garage, which has been reclaimed as a taxi route to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps in order to shorten the hike up to the apartments.
And on the 30th floor, there is a gym where all the weights and barbells are made out of the leftover pulleys from the elevators which were never installed.
In Makoko, very few systems and infrastructures exist.
With this entire village existing on the water, public space is very limited, so now that the school is finished, the ground floor is a playground for the kids, but when classes are out, the platform is just like a town square, where the fishermen mend their nets and floating shopkeepers dock their boats.
Throughout the day, it's quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets, just like this engagement party.
Many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously, putting a lot of work and care into the details.
In a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil, there lived until recently an estimated 40 million people in these houses underground.
Now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves, and how highly particular their solutions would be, if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into.
That we're overestimating the technology in the short term.
And this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job.
Computers became tools, and they got more tools that they could use and become more effective during that time.
Now today, we're starting to see robots in our lives.
And it frees up the nurses and the nurse's aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients.
And Baxter, I see, as a way -- a first wave of robot that ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting.
The eyes are on the screen there.
But I think the most interesting thing about Baxter is the user interface.
He's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from.
She's worked on the line for over 20 years.
There aren't many young people coming into factory work.
This is the percentage of adults who are working age.
And as the number of people who are older, above retirement age and getting older, as they increase, there will be less people to take care of them.
And that we will all come to rely on robots over the next 40 years as part of our everyday lives.
The system measures the beam's time of flight, recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return.
Approximately ten years ago, my wife and I started a foundation to do good, and right about that time, the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas, hundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan, were blown up by the Taliban.
The results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers.
And of course the data can be used to develop 3D models that are very accurate and very detailed.
We're losing our sites and the stories, and basically we're losing a piece -- and a significant piece -- of our collective memory.
Let me close with another short story.
We owe it to our children, our grandchildren and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along.
You can look from different vantage points, but I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in on an individual in the crowd, just to show the amount of detail that we can create.
I spent the better part of a decade looking at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide.
And that was that an American congresswoman named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado met with a group of journalists.
The phones just aren't ringing about the people."
There has to be a role -- there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth.
To call it a movement, as with all movements, perhaps, is a little misleading.
They've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide.
And that's all the Bush administration's leadership, and it's all because of this bottom-up pressure and the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis.
The first is that the movement, such as it is, stops at America's borders. It is not a global movement.
So one reason is it hasn't gone global.
The place that I turned to answer that question was to a man that many of you may not have ever heard of, and that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who, as Chris said, was blown up in Iraq in 2003.
He was Bobby Kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist, as people always wondered about Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way.
He was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion.
Talk about evil prevailing. I mean, here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia.
So then you have to make the decision.
He's been up to that point in 14 war zones so he's positioned to make better judgments, perhaps, than people who have never done that kind of work.
If you represent everyone, in some ways you represent no one.
Here's this guy who got a 34-year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with, we as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away?
And in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in '82, he said to himself and to everybody else, I will never use the word "unacceptable" again.
And it doesn't have to be an act of weakness.
If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us, and as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries, it would be something of a revolution.
In times of fear, for instance, one of the things Sergio used to say is, fear is a bad advisor.
We can't rely upon our institutions to do the work of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own without us creating a space for that to happen, for having respect for dignity, and for bringing that combination of humility and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility to our dealings with the rest of the world.
Because one cup of food a day changes Fabian's life completely.
Others worry about peace and security, stability in the world.
This is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain.
And it was at that moment that I just was filled with the challenge and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem.
Yet again, the face of starvation at large scale with more than nine million people wondering if they can make it to the next day.
Their brains and bodies will be stunted.
I'd like to talk about some of the things I've seen on the front lines of hunger, some of the things I've learned in bringing my economic and trade knowledge and my experience in the private sector.
The second thing I'd like to talk about: If you were living in a remote village somewhere, your child was limp, and you were in a drought, or you were in floods, or you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet, what would you do?
But this is transforming 99 percent of the kids who get this.
And usually the institutions -- churches, temples, other things -- do not have the resources to provide a safety net.
And there was no argument, because it's incentive.
I'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope.
And the food banks are growing.
We certainly saw that in 2008.
It is a win-win-win situation that starts the food economy moving.
Today, food aid, our food aid -- huge engine -- 80 percent of it is bought in the developing world.
It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil, and it's at scale, and it's creating opportunities.
And the world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities to do this.
I am so honored to be here with some of the world's top innovators and thinkers.
For the last 50 years, we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer, not in controlling cancer.
So, that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle.
You know, the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease.
As one gets older? Very, very common.
So, our dictionary for describing cancer is very, very poor.
So, obviously, the technology is here today, and, over the next several years, that will change.
There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes, which I think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease.
And I'm here to tell you, it's wrong.
It's what we call a system.
People got upset, but this is the only way we're going to go forward.
You know, if I measured your temperature over 30 days, and I asked, "What was the average temperature?"
And a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here are really different than we understand them, because we're not measuring them dynamically.
A neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here, but when you start to put them together in a complex system, and you start to see that it becomes a brain, and that brain can create intelligence, what we're talking about in the body, and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system.
Reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug that doesn't even touch the cancer.
They then recur, I give them that same drug every week.
I mean, this is a scary slide, not to take an aside, but it looks at obesity in the world.
Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified.
She goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway, and again, I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system, in the cancer, but it targeted a pathway, and a month later, pow, that cancer's gone.
So the morning the FDA was going to meet, this was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal.
If we slow the disease, we may have more of a benefit on patient survival, patient outcome, how they feel, than if we shrink the disease.
But if one is unfortunate to get a disease, you'll go into your doctor's office, he or she will take a drop of blood, and we will start to know how to treat your disease.
Yesterday, the National Cancer Institute announced a new program called the Physical Sciences and Oncology, where physicists, mathematicians, are brought in to think about cancer, people who never approached it before.
And certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter and actually move forward, instead of just having encounter and encounter, without fundamental learning.
Thank you very much.
It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it.
Music is not the only kind of sound, however, which affects your emotions.
If you have to work in an open-plan office like this, your productivity is greatly reduced.
So if I were to play this -- -- for more than a few seconds, you'd feel uncomfortable; for more than a few minutes, you'd be leaving the room in droves.
At last we've got some science we can apply.
Music is very powerful. And unfortunately it's veneering commercial spaces, often inappropriately.
Just leave you with four golden rules, for those of you who run businesses, for commercial sound.
And, finally, test and test it again.
Thank you for lending me your ears today.
It's going to be 40 below, every single day.
And while we were there we learned the seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa.
I'm telling you, crossing these things with 170-pound sled, that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds, because that's what it felt like.
We were burning about 8,500 a day, so we needed it.
We arrived at the South Pole. We huddled into that tent, 45 below that day, I'll never forget it.
I'm learning this at 40 years of age.
Well, now is that time.
Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970, when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon.
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system."
That's where all the assets are!
No water, no life; no blue, no green.
Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously.
We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales.
We can now go to the Arctic.
Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets, gear that continues to kill.
For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch.
There are still some krill in Antarctica.
About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected: safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink, generating oxygen, protecting watersheds.
We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens.
They flash, and sparkle, and glow with their own living light.
A global plan of action with a world conservation union, the IUCN, is underway to protect biodiversity, to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change, on the high seas and in coastal areas, wherever we can identify critical places.
You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?
I'm obsessed with insects, particularly insect flight.
Now I have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink, so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye, the fly has seen this looming predator, estimated its position, initiated a motor pattern to fly it away, beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so.
And it turns out that the insects flap their wings in a very clever way, at a very high angle of attack that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing, a little tornado-like structure called a leading edge vortex, and it's that vortex that actually enables the wings to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air.
So let's look at the controller.
One of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has is a structure called the halteres.
And let's explore this notion of simplicity.
We'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly.
And I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice, it's really comparable. They have to forage for food.
Pshhew.
It looks sort of like a fly. It has wings, it has eyes, it has antennae, its legs, complicated life history, it's a parasite, it has to fly around and find caterpillars to parasatize, but not only is its brain the size of a salt grain, which is comparable for a fruit fly, it is the size of a salt grain.
And these are the two concepts I'd like to explore.
The amazing thing about this is that it's controlled by a really tiny set of neurons, about two dozen neurons that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns, and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion in the crab is actually inundated by many, many neuromodulators.
You can tether a fly to a little stick.
And this is what one of these experiments looks like.
But this is just one of many neuromodulators that's in the fly's brain.
So I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time, and as I say up here, please think before you swat.
I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders.
We make a decision it's that big, even though it's not that big.
99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes.
And that's what I'm going to describe to you today.
It was so successful in evolution that from mouse to man it expanded about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons, to produce this almost frightening organ, structure.
Each of these neocortical columns would produce a note.
In fact, there is a new theory of autism called the "intense world" theory, which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns.
How many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?
And these synapses together form the network or the circuit of the brain.
And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way.
We can use less or more of them.
We also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information, and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other.
So where do you go? You go to IBM, and you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take 10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator.
We can ask, "Where is it inside, if we stimulate it with a picture?"
So the next step is just to take these brain coordinates and to project them into perceptual space.
This took place in my childhood -- 1957 to '65.
So we had a few kayaks.
So put that library at the bottom of that ship -- that's how big the thing was going to be.
Some of the sizes of the ships, ranging all the way up to ship mass of 8 million tons, so that was the outer extreme.
And that's why when you get something declassified, that's what it looks like.
They built a high-explosive propelled model.
Jeff Bezos kindly, yesterday, said he'll put this video up on the Amazon site -- some little clip of it.
Personnel compartment noise: that's not too bad; it's very low frequencies, it's basically like these subwoofers.
The Air Force version: here we have a military version.
And one of the bad things that could happen to NASA is if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out and everybody says, "Well, what are we going to do?"
Less than a mile from here in this direction, in 1853 a Scotsman filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe.
That's a pretty hard act to beat.
These are early deaths that take place.
And I've designed those projections to serve a key role, which is to work with the skin's immune system.
So firstly, the projections on the Nanopatch breach through the tough outer layer and the vaccine is very quickly released -- within less than a minute, in fact.
So vaccines work by introducing into our body a thing called an antigen which is a safe form of a germ.
Now, to give you an idea of scale, if the needle was shown here, it would be too big.
So what if you've targeted cells?
This is a data slide showing the immune responses that we've generated with a Nanopatch compared to the needle and syringe into muscle.
We can push it one way, where we can take a vaccine that works but is too expensive and can get protection with a hundredth of the dose compared to the needle.
I'd like to now switch to talk about another key shortcoming of today's vaccines, and that is the need to maintain the cold chain.
Within my lab we've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius for more than a year without any loss in activity at all.
It's about the same size as France, but it suffers from many of the key barriers existing within the world of today's vaccines.
And as we look ahead I'd like to share with you a thought: It's the thought of a future where the 17 million deaths per year that we currently have due to infectious disease is a historical footnote.
And I came up with an idea that I will write a cookbook.
If you really want to do it you have to do it."
But the more interesting thing was that I started learning from people.
If I asked you what's longer, the vertical line on the table on the left, or the horizontal line on the table on the right?
You can't look at this and say, "Okay now I see reality as it is."
Can anybody see them as identical?
Vision is one of the best things we do.
It's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein.
For example, Sweden is all the way on the right, and Denmark, that we think is culturally very similar, is all the way on the left.
It's 28 percent in organ donation.
The countries on the right, the ones that give a lot, have a slightly different form.
When you walk into the DMV, the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing.
So a standard economist, someone who believes in rationality, would say, "You know what? The cost of lifting the pencil and marking a V is higher than the possible benefit of the decision, so that's why we get this effect."
And they said, "Well, this effect also happens to experts, people who are well-paid, experts in their decisions, do it a lot."
So the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced.
You let them go. Or you pull them back.
Let's go for hip replacement."
Imagine I said, "A weekend in Rome, a weekend in Paris, or having your car stolen?"
Here are two examples of this principle.
The next thing I know, the ad is gone. And no explanation.
I gave it to another 100 students. Here is what happens.
One more example of this.
I took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive.
Similar. Similar ... but slightly uglier.
But there is a silver lining.
Thank you very much.
And we even have to be asked sometimes, very kindly, to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons.
That is efficiency.
These radio waves penetrate through walls.
it's good for a nice suntan, but otherwise dangerous for the human body.
I compared the radio waves spectrum -- the size of it -- with the size of the visible light spectrum.
Go to the main floor, you see these light bulbs.
So let's show how we do that.
You will say, "Okay, this is nice -- a slide created in 10 minutes."
The receiver will convert these little, subtle changes in the amplitude that we create there into an electrical signal.
And that's a video, a high-definition video that is transmitted through that light beam.
You don't notice with your human eye.
So I've mentioned to you the four challenges.
You will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital.
So no one, if I have a light here, if I have secure data, no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data.
Well you may see the impact already now.
And every street lamp could be a free access point.
And in the future, you would not only have 14 billion light bulbs, you may have 14 billion Li-Fis deployed worldwide -- for a cleaner, a greener, and even a brighter future.
You're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors.
You've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology.
But also, the genome is really the instruction manual.
And that may not sound very intuitive, but let me flip over to something else you know about, and that's computers.
So, if you look at a human genome, they consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs. That's a lot.
So, up to this point we tried to fix it by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology, which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it, and maybe it's going to make it work.
They recently sequenced Pinot Noir, and it also has about 30,000 genes, so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity or the evolutionary order of any particular species.
And if you think about the computer industry and how we've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time, the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now: we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour; you will see that happen in the next five years.
Because what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time.
So, you know, we now can learn the history of organisms.
An architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox, and we now have the ability to use it.
Well, actually, you could do it the other way.
So, then what do you do?
We could produce better flavors and aromas.
But we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants, as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes, it is the ecosystem around them, it is the microbes that live in their root systems, that have just as much impact on the character of those plants as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves.
We can figure out what the heck terroir is.
... and they would say, "Are, you know, are you playing God?"
So, what's happening today is, Nature is presenting us with a toolbox, and we find that this toolbox is very extensive.
I just ask the question, if you could cure all disease -- if you could make disease go away, because we understand how it actually works, if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants that grow in very hard-to-grow environments, if we could create clean and plentiful energy -- we, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics, have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline.
Dogs have interests.
So, when we train, we're always trying to take into account the dog's point of view.
And you go, "Oh, there's a good boy."
The number one is, "I have it, you don't."
"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws, stamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice, hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper, knee him in the chest, flip him over backwards."
I could speak to you and say, "Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey."
Or they go, "Sit, sit, sit."
So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.
Basically, we follow a low-frequency behavior -- one the dog doesn't want to do -- by a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem, or a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do.
All I have to do is sit, and they do everything.
Sorry, no more explanation. "I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit."
You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.
A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen, so while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit -- we did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat.
It's not a good dog you shout at.
But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.
Previously, when I've approached, I've gotten punished there."
And ugly face is this -- when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child, you say, "What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!"
And this is what it's all about.
When you watch people interacting with animals or other people, there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.
You know, calculus is wonderful.
If it's good, say, "That was really neat, thank you."
So, that would be my wish to the future.
The second -- the second is that this process does not have a signature.
So, this is the promise of high modernism: within a single space, actually, any kind of activity can happen.
This is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years, the evolution of the book and other technologies.
And what we saw were buildings that were very generic.
Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say, "You know what? We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books.
They signed it, and to their chagrin, we came back a week later, and we presented them this.
So, you see the five platforms -- those are the boxes -- within each one a very discrete thing is happening.
The glass was then -- I'll just use the word impregnated -- but it had a layer of metal that was called "stressed metal."
So now we're going into what we call the reading room -- sorry, living room.
This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife. Right there.
OK, now I'm going to go back, and so I'm going to hit a second project.
So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head: to take those things that were previously defined as front-of-house and back-of-house and stack them -- above house and below house -- and to create sort of what we started to call a theater machine.
This is the theater up close.
Open up entire portions for different kinds of events.
And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma, so they worked in reverse.
So these -- we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub.
So that's the basic concept, and now I'm going to show you what it leads to.
It's very simple: it's a chair.
Chris asked me to add -- the theater is under construction, and this project will start construction in about a year, and finish in 2010.
Five years ago you had an idea. What was that?
So you copied -- you exactly copied the design in the book.
You tested three, and found that four worked better?
WK: 12 watts.
And so what's your -- what are you going to do with this?
Wow. And so you're talking to people here at TED to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize this dream?
When I wake up in the morning I pour the coffee I read the paper And then I slowly and so softly do the dishes So feed the fishes You sing me happy birthday Like it's gonna be your last day here on Earth All right.
And I'm going to demonstrate for you.
And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs.
Or ears being able to hear themselves -- it's just impossible.
You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research.
They want to ask me something.
Here are three questions drawn from my work.
As Juan said, it's the condition that scientists call synesthesia, an unusual cross-talk between the senses.
And here is one of my paintings.
And this is an opening phrase from the novel "Lolita."
If some of you play chess, you'll know that 64 is a square number, and that's why chessboards, eight by eight, have 64 squares.
That's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math, I'm sure.
Some people say it's happy.
And poets, like other artists, play with those intuitive understandings.
So in these few minutes, I hope I've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions, numbers, shapes and personalities.
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.
How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous?
I've tried to work out which is bigger, and it's almost impossible.
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.
Well, it uses sexual reproduction.
No other animal does it.
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.
He can make his own spears and axes.
You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.
In other words, the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800.
Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee, which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig, who was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc.
But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV's pictures, he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too.
That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction.
It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male.
When did this happen? We don't know, but it's possible that Neanderthals didn't do this.
There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females.
Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years.
What happens when you cut people off from exchange, from the ability to exchange and specialize?
The Tasmanians were isolated.
The person on the assembly line doesn't know because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic, and so on.
It's completely irrelevant.
Awful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure.
Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt, or whatever.
Now, that number is dwarfed by the number of paper cups we use every day, and that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages, most of which is coffee.
One out of four people, one out of four humans in prison are Americans, imprisoned in our country.
I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction.
It will be something that we talk about in 100 years.
And this is what the next piece is about.
This is a piece that I just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon, this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery.
And the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fear that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now.
And so that's what I'm trying to do with my work, is to take these numbers, these statistics from the raw language of data, and to translate them into a more universal visual language, that can be felt.
And it will profoundly affect the well-being, the quality of life of the billions of people who are going to inherit the results of our decisions.
This is a picornavirus.
And I'm coloring these small windows blue if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome to that virus.
We took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots, and this is what you see: you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here.
And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project -- we just started by making a respiratory virus chip.
And so, that's a hard way to look at things, so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode, grouped by family, so you can see the results in a very intuitive way.
And Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus gives a nice signature down here.
You can imagine building up some library, whether real or virtual, of fingerprints of essentially every virus.
Well, it's pretty simple.
Day zero: nothing happening.
They both have rhinoviruses; we've never seen this pattern in lab.
Here's another individual, sampled on two separate days -- repeat visits to the clinic.
And the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns, because we're never going to get samples of every virus -- it would be virtually impossible. But we can get virtual patterns, and compare them to our observed result -- which is a very complex mixture -- and come up with some sort of score of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something.
We have a 28-year-old healthy woman, no travel history, [unclear], doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.
They had to intubate her, so they put a tube down her throat and they began to mechanically ventilate her.
And I'm no pathologist, but you can't tell much from this.
We put it on the chip; what do we see? Well, we saw parainfluenza-4.
OK, that's one case report.
So, we put tumors --- and now we have over 100 tumors -- on our array.
It's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new; no one's ever seen it before.
Nothing I'm saying here implies causality. I don't know.
This is a collaboration between myself and Don.
You see, the battery is the key enabling device here.
So I'm not here today only to tell you how my team at MIT has drawn out of nature a solution to one of the world's great problems.
Here's the first battery -- a stack of coins, zinc and silver, separated by cardboard soaked in brine.
So that means that certain parts of the periodic table are axiomatically off-limits.
And just a few short years following their discovery, aluminum changed from a precious metal costing as much as silver to a common structural material.
That's the economic miracle of modern electrometallurgy.
And that includes our own bodies.
It could be something like a wind farm.
No, I hire a student and mentor him, teach him how to think about the problem, to see it from my perspective and then turn him loose.
We start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell.
But the pace wasn't fast enough for us.
That's enough energy to meet the daily electrical needs of 200 American households.
Our battery can handle the very high temperature rises that come from current surges.
Is this thing off?
All the footage was taken from our open ROV, which is a robot that we built in our garage.
It's how we've built it that's really unique.
So about that time, our little expedition became quite a story, and it got picked up in The New York Times.
So we're still publishing all the designs online, encouraging anyone to build these themselves.
It was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration.
And at the time I didn't think much about it, but then later, I realized that that was the high point of my education.
So a few years ago, I actually started getting very interested in the SETI program. And that's the way I work.
In playing this toy, you kind of -- this will bring up philosophical questions in you.
So as we eat, the camera starts pulling out, and then we start interacting with kind of larger and larger organisms.
OK, well, we fight.
I can move around here. I can extend.
So in some sense we want this to feel like an amplifier for the player's imagination, so that with a very small number of clicks a player can create something that they didn't really think was possible before.
And so we're procedurally generating the texture map, and this is something a texture artist would take many, many days to work on.
Now again, the empathy that the players have when they create the content is tremendous. Now, when players create content in this game, it's automatically sent up to a server and then redistributed to all the other players transparently.
So that's kind of what these tools are about, are: how do we make the game play the player's imagination-amplifier?
Things like the buildings, and the vehicles, the architecture, civilizations were all designed by the player up to this point.
But there's a very simple little kind of calculation of what's required, how much plants are required for the herbivores to live, how many herbivores for the carnivores to eat, etc., that you actually have to balance actively.
And our cities are going to be at risk too, because a lot of these are coastal cities.
Here it goes.
And all my favorite science fiction movies I want to basically play out here as different dynamics.
OK, well maybe they're not worshipping me.
But these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here.
Because if you think about it, you're going to have 15-year-olds, 20-year-olds, whatever, flying around this universe.
So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack, and all it requires of you is this: that you change your posture for two minutes.
So, we're really fascinated with body language, and we're particularly interested in other people's body language.
And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this. So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language, or other people's body language, on judgments.
We are also influenced by our nonverbals, our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology.
And humans do the same thing.
So again, both animals and humans do the same thing.
You see it on their faces and their bodies, and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny, and they go like this when they raise their hand.
So I started to wonder, you know, okay, so you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating. Is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more?
And when I say minds, in the case of the powerful, what am I talking about?
So what we find is that high-power alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol, and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol.
So this is what we did. We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment, and these people adopted, for two minutes, either high-power poses or low-power poses, and I'm just going to show you five of the poses, although they took on only two.
When you're touching your neck, you're really protecting yourself.
So again, two minutes, and you get these changes.
We decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview.
So we bring people into a lab, and they do either high- or low-power poses again, they go through a very stressful job interview.
They have no idea who's been posing in what pose, and they end up looking at these sets of tapes, and they say, "Oh, we want to hire these people," -- all the high-power posers -- "we don't want to hire these people.
So when I tell people about this, that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior, and our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me, "I don't -- It feels fake." Right?
I knew my I.Q. because I had identified with being smart, and I had been called gifted as a child.
And the night before my first-year talk, and the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people. That's it.
And she said, she came in totally defeated, and she said, "I'm not supposed to be here."
She comes back to me months later, and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it, she had actually faked it till she became it.
That's what you want to do. Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation.
How many Creationists do we have in the room?
And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that, keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here.
Yeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke.
Well, it may already have occurred to you that Islam means "surrender," or "submission of self-interest to the will of Allah."
And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam.
I myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards is that people ask us what the meaning of life is.
It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests.
Now here am I talking about his idea.
So we have to keep plugging away, trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread.
That is, there is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does.
Then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced.
They survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren't there.
There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile.
We're doing it this time with toxic ideas.
They are wiping out traditions and practices.
Well now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes?
And, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them.
Up to and around about the Second World War, conductors were invariably dictators -- these tyrannical figures who would rehearse, not just the orchestra as a whole, but individuals within it, within an inch of their lives.
So in order for all this to work, obviously I have got to be in a position of trust.
Bugger me, they wouldn't give it to me.
I heard about 2,000 singers and pulled together a company of 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers, the majority of whom were black, but there were a handful of white performers.
And that showed me such a fundamental truth, that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words cannot.
And I think, in no small way, that's due to one fundamental fact: they're not bound to a system of notation.
But how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion about a piece of classical music?
If I sing you a musical scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G -- and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet, same scale: H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T -- there you go.
If you'll pardon the expression.
Charles Hazlewood: Yeah, you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings.
One more time, with feeling, ladies and gentlemen.
So I find myself asking: where is music in all of this?
Then suddenly, as if by magic, bang! We're all in there and it's complete bedlam. You can't hear anything.
I become alive.
Now one day in 1772, the prince decreed that the musicians' families, the orchestral musicians' families, were no longer welcome in the castle.
Where there is no trust, the music quite simply withers away.
Fast forward -- 11 years later, I'm a 25-year-old kid.
And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda, it destroyed the local retailing industry.
The women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses, earn more income so they could take care of their families better.
And at the same time, what keeps me up at night is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 -- 50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa, 40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory, as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.
That's who we talk about when we think about "the poor."
So, two examples.
This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit when they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to with a corrugated iron roof.
It's estimated that Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease.
We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these long-lasting, five-year nets.
Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N., and then given primarily to people around Africa.
She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece, despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one, and we learned a lot about how you sell things.
To do it right, we have to build business models that matter, that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians, people all over the developing world who fit in this category, to do it themselves.
Well three sons got into a negotiation.
The second son took his third -- a third of 18 is six.
I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers.
It's actually surprisingly simple.
Because, after all, within living memory, they were hunters and gatherers, living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 percent of the human story.
But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side, and the third side of the conflict is us, it's the surrounding community, it's the friends, the allies, the family members, the neighbors.
The third side helps us go to the balcony, which is a metaphor for a place of perspective, where we can keep our eyes on the prize.
I started reacting, but then I tried to remember to go to the balcony.
Now I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict, but I think I've got a first step, literally, a first step, something that any one of us could do as third-siders.
No, it's because of the story, because we feel personally involved in that story.
Let's see if we can apply the third side to it.
His basic message was unity too, the interconnectedness of it all, the unity of it all, and his basic value was respect, was kindness toward strangers.
It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding, or respect, or love.
You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham.
So the idea came to me of what about inspiring a path, a route -- think the silk route, think the Appalachian trail -- that followed in the footsteps of Abraham.
Then we crossed the border into Syria, went to Aleppo, which, turns out, is named after Abraham.
But that's what you discover, is you go into these villages in the Middle East where you expect hostility, and you get the most amazing hospitality, all associated with Abraham.
In Cincinnati, for instance, that organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together.
It brought us hope.
She makes the most delicious food that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside.
I have a little acorn here that I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year.
So let me conclude then by saying that in the last 35 years, as I've worked in some of the most dangerous, difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet, I have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed.
Just go up to someone who's from a different culture, a different country, a different ethnicity, some difference, and engage them in a conversation; listen to them.
If we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace, we can even halt the lion of war.
Housing For Health works with poor people.
He got an environmental health guy.
[Washing, clothes, wastewater, nutrition... ] Now, I was very, very unimpressed.
And the highest priority, you see on the screen, is washing people once a day, particularly children.
I want you to select one of them and note the position of that house and keep that in your head.
And I know that's going to come as a shock to some of you, but you are.
This is a big deal, so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids.
We start on day one of every project -- we've learned, we don't make promises, we don't do reports.
We can get showers up to 86 percent working, we can get electrical systems up to 77 percent working, and we can get 90 percent of toilets working in those 7,500 houses.
Simply not done, the house doesn't work.
Seventy-five percent of our national team in Australia, over 75 at the minute, are actually local, indigenous people from the communities we work in.
We put washing facilities in the school as well, so kids can wash their faces many times during the day.
Then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally.
And over the year, trachoma dropped radically in this place, and stayed low.
We went in with no grand plan, no grand promises of a great program, just the offer to build two toilets for two families.
How do we actually get the smoke down? So two problems, and design should be about more than one thing.
He's got significantly less gut infection because he's now got toilets, and there isn't human waste on the ground.
We've never found that.
I am not a farmer.
But I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet, so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that I'm hoping to share with you all today.
All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners, most come with a lot of handicaps, most are homeless and many are in foster care.
He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall.
And what do you know? We made 21st century money, and that was groundbreaking. Wow!
And when you can do stuff like this -- These are my kids putting in this technology, and when you can build a roof that looks like that on a house that looks like that with sedum that looks like this, this is the new green graffiti.
That's the beauty of this economy.
Really scholastic, if you ask me.
Produce Pete can't believe what we grow.
That's triple bottom line! Okay?
So we started giving back.
No more little Knicks and little Nets.
Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions, moving kids into an economy they never imagined.
This is what we're doing.
So that's my incredible classroom, that's the food.
And we take orders for flowers. I'm putting the bake sale to shame.
Happy kids, happy families, happy colleagues.
Self-sustaining entities, 18 months return on investment, plus we're paying people living wage and health benefits, while feeding people for pennies on the dollar.
Keep kids out of stores that look like this.
It's not. I come from a place where kids can buy 35 flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment, where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor.
I'm Steve Ritz, this is Green Bronx Machine.
And people with silent ischemia -- which, translated into English, means they don't have any symptoms -- it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital.
Well, what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack?
And then we put a lead, which is a wire, in the right ventricle inside the heart, which does the electrogram, which is the signal voltage from inside the heart.
Then we tried it with my son, Dr. Tim Fischell, we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in.
Well, on the left is the IMD, which is Implantable Medical Device, and tonight in the tent you can see it -- they've exhibited it.
We said, so we'll put in a stent, but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people.
This pig at 10:06 was having a heart attack.
Well, you feel some chest pain or indigestion.
And when you have a blockage, the alarm goes off and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device, which gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago and the one that caused the alarm, so you can take it to the emergency room and show them, and say, take care of me right away.
At first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem because I'd never had a migraine headache, but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life, and their lives are being totally ruined by it.
And what we tried was this; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10.
That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current that's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain.
The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that.
Our conclusions from our studies so far, at three research centers, is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once.
We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.
And then with four screws, we put in a frame, then we snap in the device and we run with wires -- the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes, to the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy, where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.
I'm a tech; I'm into medical gadgetry, which is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about.
So, to get quickly to my first wish -- the brain operates by electrical signals.
Well, that's the good news.
Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury, because this patient really ended up badly.
They don't understand what the hell it's about.
The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs.
A year and a half ago, four of the five people who are full time members at Ushahidi, which means "testimony" in Swahili, were TED Fellows.
We needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world.
Just this last month it was deployed by Al Jazeera in Gaza.
And what we're actually really concerned with is this first three hours.
So we think that there is something interesting we can do here.
And it's a community around it that has decided to build this.
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, "Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."
There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug.
As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire, I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.
I'm Rich Baraniuk.
Anyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical ideas, use them in innovative ways.
OK, I'm not going to spend too much time on that, but what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects that appear when an author publishes a book that in fact, the publishing process -- just because of the fact that it's complicated, it's heavy, books are expensive -- creates a sort of a wall between authors of books and the ultimate users of books, be they teachers, students or just general readers.
Think of it as a massive iTunes for book type content.
We're working on the open-source tools and the content.
What about copying, reusing, right?
OK, other organizations we've been working with, UC Merced, people know about UC Merced.
And I think a lot of you received, I think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack.
Because it's published on demand and it's developed from this repository of open materials.
OK, so what are the enablers?
So, it lets you take this ecosystem in its primordial state, right, of all this content, all the pages you've torn out of books, and create highly sophisticated learning machines: books, courses, course packs.
And people who are teachers out here, whoever taught, you know this -- it's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about.
OK, the second big enabler, and this is where I told a big lie.
How many people have heard of creative commons?
Not just text, but music, images, video, and there's actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music to make it free for people who do this whole idea of re-sampling, rip, mixing, burning and sharing.
It didn't take long until people started contributing materials, for example, on lingerie, which is actually a pretty good module.
All of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge and what I'd like to do is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and other projects of its type, because I think together we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing.
And at some point I'll even pass around what the $100 laptop might be like.
And that is that we all in this room learned how to walk, how to talk, not by being taught how to talk, or taught how to walk, but by interacting with the world, by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something, or being able to stand up and reach it.
A little bit more recently, I got involved personally.
Really, they were actually against it.
It's a nonprofit association; it raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built, and then have it produced afterwards.
And they said, "Oh, well maybe we could become part of your strategic plan."
It's the so-called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia.
Now the display on your laptop costs, in rough numbers, 10 dollars a diagonal inch.
And somebody -- to remain nameless -- called our laptop a "gadget" recently.
So you really can bring into a village, and then the villages can connect themselves, and you really can do it quite well.
And in about 30 days we'll know for sure whether this works.
And it's clearly just a model.
Etc., etc. -- is that enough for simulcast? OK, sorry.
And yet we count.
Here's sort of the schedule, and I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting.
Because there's no market for post office trucks.
I mean, there are all sorts of things that will happen, and they'll be very, very exciting.
The only criticism, and people really don't want to criticize this, because it is a humanitarian effort; it is a nonprofit effort; and to criticize it is a little bit stupid, actually.
You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator, but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices.
Well, what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species.
What does the inside of your computer actually look like?
And the problem is that a lot of people now, especially adolescents, have to go through two adolescences.
He took a piece of paper, drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched.
But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works.
One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone, the room would be very crowded.
So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.
And so this is the important point that I like to study: that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection -- it's just done in a different way.
And then someone says, "These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community."
There are 1.4 million pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries living with HIV and of these, 90 percent are in sub-Saharan Africa.
The reality is really, very different.
Less than 100 babies are born with HIV each year in the United States and yet, still, over 400,000 children are born every year in the world today with HIV.
And let's look at another map.
Well, fortunately since 2001, we've got new treatments, new tests, and we're far more successful, but we don't have any more nurses.
You should always use a condom," and yet, in her relationship, she's not empowered -- what's going to happen?
And then you're out on the street, and you don't know where to go.
Have a seat. You're safe here.
We bring mothers who have HIV, who've been through these PMTCT programs in the very facilities, to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team.
And we open bank accounts for them and they're paid directly into the accounts, because their money's protected; the men can't take it away from them.
The second: keep mothers healthy, keep mothers alive, keep the children alive -- no more orphans.
The father and the mother, together, they get the results.
If we can change the way households believe and think, we can change the way communities believe and think.
And the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings, "I have something to tell you. I'm HIV-positive."
The last sister stood up and said, "I'm also positive.
Even as we have more tests and more drugs, we can't reach people; we don't have enough providers.
So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission.
We need to change attitudes to women in Africa.
Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from, I was in the shower at the time -- I was alone.
Those who are HIV-negative must know how to stay negative.
Back then, 15 years ago, we didn't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and track development across the lifespan.
It's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions, things like decision-making, planning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year, inhibiting inappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid.
So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age.
So in my lab, we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan, we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people, their minds, their mental states, their emotions, and one of the findings that we've found several times now, as have other labs around the world, is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex, which is shown in blue on the slide, and it's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex in the midline of your head.
Now your task is to move objects around.
Developmentally, these two conditions develop in exactly the same way. Between late childhood and mid-adolescence, there's an improvement, in other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials, in both of these conditions.
So people often ask, "Well, is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon?
So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain, and it's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things, including taking risks.
It actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and social development. Thank you.
So I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so I could introduce Kevin to my robot.
I was devastated by this, and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build.
And we had put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the robot, and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden.
And the more I thought about it, I couldn't think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference.
Like, for example, what if it could go to a dinner party at the White House?
We had no idea that would happen.
And the way it's done, as you can see here, is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds, and all this, all these needles are inserted in parallel, so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs, and as a result, the needles damage these organs, cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects.
Now, it's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this, but it turns out my colleague, Pieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley, has develeloped a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example.
Now, so what we're doing is that we take those human demonstrations, they're all noisy and imperfect, and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot.
And here's the robot operating at 10 times the speed of the human.
And now I get to teach her how things work, and we get to build projects together, and I wonder what kind of lessons that she'll learn from them.
He said, if Mae West can be M-A-E, why can't Keshava be K-A-E?
Our parents think we're cuckoo.
You know, I never really believed in legacy. What am I going to leave behind? I'm an artist.
You know, sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic.
But like my friends, I can do that really well on Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube.
And I've been very supportive until this picture shows up on my Facebook page.
I can actually visualize my future approaching.
As it turned out, next morning I wrote a letter to both of them, and Shabana Azmi replied, and came and launched my very first show 12 years ago.
I said, "Wow," again.
You know, if this is so, it occurred to me that maybe, just maybe, the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity.
I like to think -- Thank you.
I must admit, I used to be one of them.
The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals, and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s.
Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables, like pesticides and herbicides, to kill weeds and bugs.
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world.
I want you to know that there are farms out there -- like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee -- whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought.
And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference one kid at a time.
OK, this is the title of my talk today.
Mentions of polar bears drowning: four percent.
So Robert Wright -- I don't know, I felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to, it might have been him.
So I wanted to show you guys -- I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you -- as a completely natural user interface.
And it's by a guy named Pastor Rick Warren, and it's called "The Porpoise Driven Life."
OK, now they're duking it out. Now they're duking it out.
It needs to be flat, so it's transportable.
OK, OK, OK, OK -- excellent, excellent.
I wanted to show you the stages of smallpox.
They've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions, clinic solutions, in Africa, and they've had a design competition.
And the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof to collect water and recycle it.
Could you say that again? What's your favorite singing group?
Computer: My sweet Satan. Dan Dennett worships Satan.
[Korean] to Portuguese: Aquecer-se Global.
Or is it Mena Trott?
So we build this building on stilts, then up here -- is where we're going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium.
If we put up the ELMO for a moment -- if we put up the ELMO, then we'll get, you know, I'll give you a model that you can work from, OK?
3.1415, 2657, 753, 8567, 24972 -- -- 85871, 25871, 3928, 5657, 2592, 5624.
This year, unfortunately the lakebed's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed.
And I've dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world.
I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica.
And that's probably because that's when everybody got aware of the environment and Earth Day and all the stuff that happened in the '60s with the Hippies and everything really did, I think, have an affect on global awareness.
It's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere.
Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area.
That's the vessel that we took up there for these studies, early on, and that's what the Islands look like -- you can see in the background.
The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries, especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here.
Remember, a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface.
They control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean, and that's between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet.
The Islands rise only one to two meters above the surface.
I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati, who are over in Tarawa, the westernmost group.
After the talk, the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me and he said, "Greg, do you realize that you are the first scientist who has ever come back and told us what they did?"
And, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me.
So I went to Conservation International and brought them in as a partner and went through the process of valuing the fishery resource, deciding how much Kiribati should be compensated, what the range of the fishes were, brought in a whole bunch of other partners -- the government of Australia, the government of New Zealand, the World Bank.
So we had very strong leadership, very good vision and a lot of science, a lot of lawyers involved.
Of course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine, but the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble.
And it certainly was.
You can read them yourselves.
And what we need to do now is look at the whole Pacific Ocean in its entirety and make a network of MPAs across the Pacific so that we have our world's largest ocean protected and self-sustaining over time.
What they're not really doing is hiring.
The problem is, I don't think these projections are accurate.
And it's not decent, it's perfect.
They're starting to flex their muscles in the physical world as well.
Voltaire summarized why. He said, "Work saves us from three great evils: boredom, vice and need."
And you start to do things like graph things that we might be interested in, the total worldwide population, for example, or some measure of social development, or the state of advancement of a society, and you start to plot the data, because, by this approach, the big stories, the big developments in human history, are the ones that will bend these curves a lot.
So at the risk of repeating myself a little bit, when I look at what's going on with digital technology these days, we are not anywhere near through with this journey, and when I look at what is happening to our economies and our societies, my single conclusion is that we ain't seen nothing yet. The best days are really ahead.
The work of innovation is becoming more open, more inclusive, more transparent, and more merit-based, and that's going to continue no matter what MIT and Harvard think of it, and I couldn't be happier about that development.
What happened instead is he very carefully documented what happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time to an environment and a community.
About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.
So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it.
There's one from a consumer's point of view -- where I was happy while experiencing design.
Now, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint -- if you're happy while actually doing it.
Under "Arcadia," they showed things like this, from the Edo period -- a hundred ways to write "happiness" in different forms.
And I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization -- that's a really easy thing to do.
Or we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it.
So you're you're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.
You don't see the horizon.
And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles -- empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.
Which brought me back to my list making -- you know, just to see what I actually like about my job.
And, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine?
So it's: "Trying to look good limits my life."
And it's "me."
Superman's parents die on Krypton before the age of one.
And it's only by linking positive things that the negative can be delinked.
So the librarians find out and they get together a special solution, a chemical solution called King's Water, that when mixed with 99 stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books.
Thirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia.
So the idea of an open architecture, an open knowledge, is not new to my neck of the desert.
Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place.
So The 99 work in teams of three.
Well ...
I'm like, you know what, I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime, so ...
She said, "That's not me."
Now I went to Dubai, to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference, and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist.
He said, "Naif, Islam and cartoon?
And that led to all kinds of things, from being in curricula in universities and schools to -- one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia, it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school.
They don't know, OK, and they're trying to get another member of The 99 to join them.
Dr. Razem: It's time to go, Miklos.
I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything.
Dr. Razem: Don't listen to them.
Now, I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State.
And I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place.
But what do the students in Kuwait say? They said it's us -- and this is dangerous.
And what Rayan did then is he sat there, he tapped his foot on the floor, at three and a half, and he looked at me and he said, "Baba, I want you to come with me to my office in my house.
And no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was, behind us, "free falafel." You know.
Thank you very much.
So I scraped a load of reported figures from various news outlets and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts.
Americans, incredibly generous people -- over 300 billion a year, donated to charity every year, compared with the amount of foreign aid given by the top 17 industrialized nations at 120 billion.
What has that cost the world? Let's take a look at that.
But the height here, I want to point out, is the intensity of certain fears as reported in the media.
But what I love -- and I'm a journalist -- and what I love is finding hidden patterns; I love being a data detective.
Why April?
It's not a particularly great metaphor in these times, especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico, but I would, perhaps, adapt this metaphor slightly, and I would say that data is the new soil.
What rises twice a year, once in Easter and then two weeks before Christmas, has a mini peak every Monday, and then flattens out over the summer?
So, the information guru Lee Byron and myself, we scraped 10,000 status Facebook updates for the phrase "break-up" and "broken-up" and this is the pattern we found -- people clearing out for Spring Break, coming out of very bad weekends on a Monday, being single over the summer, and then the lowest day of the year, of course: Christmas Day.
But I wanted to convey something to you.
I feel that everyday, all of us now are being blasted by information design.
Then you have touch, which is about the speed of a USB key.
If you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind, which is about words and numbers and concepts, you start speaking two languages simultaneously, each enhancing the other.
Now, you can see Africa's total debt there and the U.K. budget deficit for reference.
That changes the picture considerably.
It actually has a tiny army when you take other data into consideration.
There's always conflicting evidence.
We scraped like 1,000 studies from PubMed, the biomedical database, and we compiled them and graded them all.
So heart is filtered out, so I can see if I'm curious about that.
But it can go beyond data, and it can go beyond numbers.
It's even fun to engage with them because it's visual.
Which was emitting the most CO2?
And it's been split up in successive bits and a chord.
So what you're smelling is several hundred molecules floating through the air, hitting your nose.
Some people have tried in the 1920s to add things from the bad parts, and it didn't really work.
OK, now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass, OK?
However, I came to realize gradually that they may be right -- and I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so, but I'm working on it.
Because there's a lot of money in sandalwoods.
This is cis-3-hexene-1-thiol, and this smells of rotten eggs, OK?
In fact, molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them.
I went searching for a type of molecule, any molecule, that would have that vibration and that -- the obvious prediction was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur.
Now, does it smell of sulfur? Well, if you go back in the literature, there's a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone alive then or since, Alfred Stock, he synthesized all of them.
This is a joke. I'm a biologist, OK?
This is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built.
And so that's a direct path to making new odorants.
So they asked us to make a new coumarin. And so we started doing calculations.
And this is our new baby, called tonkene.
OK? Now, we're dealing with people who only want results, and this is the commercial world.
Now what I do is I'm an economist, and I actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company, the industry and the nation, and I work with policymakers worldwide, especially in the European Commission, but recently also in interesting places like China, and I can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues: Where are the European Googles?
And in places like Europe, it might be more equitable, we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S., but the problem is this damn public sector.
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries."
What actually makes your phone a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?
So the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs, whereas the slight variations of existing drugs -- Viagra, different color, different dosage -- are the less revolutionary ones.
It was funding not only the basic research, which again is a typical public good, but even the applied research.
The private sector does a lot.
What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you, and there's many more, which myself and other colleagues have been looking at, is doing much more than de-risking.
You will fail when you innovative.
You had to be completely nuts to do it, and luckily, they were.
But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state -- Apple's a great example.
Instead, many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained.
I've been simplifying things for 30 years.
Working with the Harvard Business School, you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment: If you spent 62 dollars for a meal, the longer you take to pay out that loan, you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents.
It's a grid, it's a calendar.
They have been tested in the laboratory.
So, how are we going to change the world?
Pip from "Great Expectations" was adopted; Superman was a foster child; Cinderella was a foster child; Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, was fostered and institutionalized; Batman was orphaned; Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's "Northern Lights" was fostered; Jane Eyre, adopted; Roald Dahl's James from "James and the Giant Peach;" Matilda; Moses -- Moses!
It is that simple.
It was the primary purpose of the social worker, the aim, to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life, to sign the adoption papers.
What happened then is a direct reflection of what is happening now. Everybody believed themselves to be doing the right thing by God and by the state for the big society, fast-tracking adoption.
Norman!
And then I was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil.
They've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident.
I didn't say goodbye to anybody, not my mother, my father, my sisters, my brothers, my aunts, my uncles, my cousins, my grandparents, nobody.
But because I had no family to inquire about me, they could do anything to me.
I have to tell this story.
In the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life, the endless truth, the permanent creation of reality, the place where anger was an expression in the search for love, a place where dysfunction is a true reaction to untruth.
So I said, "No, I'm gonna be good, Honey, I'm gonna be good. I am."
So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense.
Do not tell me we can't do better than this.
And it went on for decades.
They might like that. What about a Saturday?
They will say the worst things about you.
You know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules?
They didn't have any place for their kids to go.
As a profession, we have to stop this. The science is clear.
We didn't know the role that language, a stimulus and response, call and response, how important that was in developing those children.
Nope. Lots of places, it doesn't exist.
Because I actually like kids.
You know when we're going to get the results back?
Why would you look at it?
Because in my older years, I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant.
And I will be right every single time.
This stuff hasn't worked for 55 years.
Every time something didn't work, we just threw in the towel and said, "Let's forget it." Right?
And we've got to do better. The evaluation, we have to start with kids earlier, we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people.
How many trillions?
Geoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John, 100 percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school.
They harass you, right? They call you, they say, "I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test?
We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support, but also a set of encouragements that say to them, "You can do it. It is going to be hard, but we refuse to let you fail."
Who was the better man?
Out in the hall with their crocodile tears; Now that you're out of it, now that you're leaving, Now that they've sealed your arse and your ears, What I've been meaning to tell you for years, And years, and years, and years, old friend ...
Bright as a button. All the ducks in a row.
Never succumb to the gorgon's stare.
Keep to the track, to the beaten track; No-one is waiting and nothing is there.
Just leave them alone.
Lady, this is all in vain.
Never was there one so fair!
I am no historian, ladies and gentlemen.
Which is America's Jupiter?
What of the temples of justice, Whose servants enslave us all?
But finding me busy, she fled, with the dawn.
And women grew willing to sham and to bluff.
A complete shock. I was a little ill.
I'm not an evil man.
I don't know. You can do anything you want.
Rivals for meat. Rivals for berries.
And I took crack cocaine, every single night for seven years.
If you're a woman, remember that.
But always we scrabbled to lie with her first.
Who are we?
But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.
A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa, looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.
When we then find something very important, like the bones of a human ancestor, we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly, using dental picks and fine paintbrushes.
It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden, or runs down to Lake Malawi.
And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there.
That's what we're still trying to find answers to, and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.
He was very able to use stones effectively as tools.
We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones, the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones, things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.
We evolved essentially from an African stock.
And what is it that really makes us us?
And last year, our population grew by 80 million.
We all have an African origin.
Now, the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished, all within about 150 years.
And I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton?
This folder has 17,000 photos -- over 20 gigabytes of information -- and it's growing constantly.
So, I started looking at the best photos I could find.
And so button by button, vertebrae by vertebrae, I built my way down.
And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.
This is the "Kniphausen Hawk."
I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.
And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail, I worked out and achieved -- working in front of the television and Super Sculpey -- here's me sitting next to my wife -- it's the only picture I took of the entire process.
So I was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.
John's Grill, which actually is seen briefly in "The Maltese Falcon," is still a viable San Francisco eatery, counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook, who played Wilmer Cook in the movie, and he gave them one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.
He took my master Falcon pattern, he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me, and this is the bronze I got back.
But there's a problem.
One, I can fire a freaking laser at it, which I have already done, to do a 3D scan -- there's a 3D scan of this Falcon.
As we made our way up towards the spectacular Blue Mountains west of Sydney, it was the perfect autumn day: sunshine, the smell of eucalypt and a dream.
I had extensive and life-threatening injuries.
By the time the helicopter arrived at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney, my blood pressure was 40 over nothing.
"Come on. Stay with me. We can do it. We can do it together."
They went in. They put me on a beanbag. They cut me, literally cut me in half, I have a scar that wraps around my entire body.
You have no feeling from the waist down, and at most, you might get 10- or 20-percent return.
They moved me from intensive care to acute spinal.
He put a pile on top of each of us, and he said, "Start threading them together."
I soaked it up and I thought, how could I ever have taken this for granted?
And I got home and something happened.
And I thought, "How could it? Because I've lost everything that I valued, everything that I'd worked towards.
And I wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance.
But now I was about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do: that of rebuilding a life.
I said, "Pass me the yellow pages."
And they took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws.
He said, "Would you like to have a go at taxiing?"
And he said, "Well, you take the controls, and you fly towards that mountain."
But at least she always knew where I was.
And then I got my instructor rating.
It wasn't until I let go of the life I thought I should have that I was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me.
Thank you.
I'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design.
DN Design, Nature, Art. These are the three things that condition my world.
I use, now, a whole new process.
This is the background noise of industrial design.
It's mass individualism from a single product. It fits the hand.
I took this video in Cape Town last year.
I'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that, and I'm not looking at designing architecture like that.
Actually, I put marijuana in everything I cooked -- -- and I had access to all the best girls. It was fabulous.
This is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium.
It's a godly way of working.
I set out to look at natural forms.
That is the power of organic design.
They're made from silica. Why not structures from cars like that?
If you see the shadows that come through that, they're actually probably more important than the product, but it's the minimum it takes.
When I see these animations, oh Jesus, I'm blown away.
That's the weird side coming out again, and a lot of companies don't understand that.
That is an image of a car for me.
It's got a vacuum-formed, carbon-nylon pan. Everything's holistically integrated.
It's a city car. You drive along. You get out.
Forget that. We move on.
This is the data that goes with that. Incredibly complex.
Who cares?
I would -- if anybody's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me, I'll put it in the studio.
Like I say, it's a cross between Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory. It's full of prototypes and objects.
There's an aerated brick I did in Limoges last year, in Concepts for New Ceramics in Architecture.
If all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together, it would be a joy, absolute joy.
In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau, who said, "People protect what they love," I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean, and that's the incredible number and variety of animals in it that make light.
I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room, pumping out so much light that I could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight; and puffs and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke; and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters -- just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire, but these were icy, blue embers.
So, mounted in front of the observation sphere, there's a a three-foot diameter hoop with a screen stretched across it.
Like those big explosions, sparks, are from a little comb jelly, and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans, and jellyfish.
So, if you stagger into the head late at night and you're so toilet-hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light, you may think that you're having a religious experience.
Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness, light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive: and that's find food, attract a mate and avoid being eaten.
It's also got a little chin barbel here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off.
It's got light organs in the mouth, it's got light organs in every single scale, in the fins, in a mucus layer on the back and the belly, all used for different things -- some of which we know about, some of which we don't.
He has no lure for attracting food and no teeth for eating it when it gets there.
They use it a lot for defense, many different ways.
But to me, what's shocking is not just the amount of light, but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase.
And once this display gets going, I'm not touching it anymore.
When I'm sitting in a submersible though, I know that I'm not unobtrusive at all -- I've got bright lights and noisy thrusters -- any animal with any sense is going to be long gone.
And I didn't know what I was going to discover, so I couldn't get the funding for this.
And we were very, very happy.
Four hours into the deployment, we had programmed the electronic jellyfish to come on for the first time.
Thank you.
And that space is like the personal computer in 1976, like the Apples with the other companies are fighting, and we will see in a few years, there will be the Apple of this kind of market come out.
So, we worked on Arduino and a lot of other projects there to create platforms that would be simple for our students to use, so that our students could just build things that worked, but they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month.
And I like this phrase: "Scratch your own itch."
The documentation and the hands-on teaching methodology is also open-source and released as the Creative Commons.
So let's look at some projects.
I'll show you how I made it.
This is a glove that understands the sign language and transforms the gestures you make into sounds and writes the words that you're signing on a display And again, this is made of all different parts you can find on all the websites that sell Arduino-compatible parts, and you assemble it into a project.
So it just gives a personality to your plant.
So very serious project.
Not me. I'm an old guy.
So the idea is that the hardware, the software, the design of the object, the fabrication, everything about this project is open-source and you can make it yourself.
The last project I want to show you is this: It's called ArduSat. It's currently on Kickstarter, so if you want to contribute, please do it.
MB: Well, it's the work of a lot of people, so we as a community are enabling people to make great stuff, and I just feel overwhelmed.
Two-and-a-half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion.
If you had gotten five, this dinner would have been a lot more interesting."
While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7, maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture.
You may know that birds don't understand the concept of glass. They don't see it, so they fly into the windows and get killed.
And then this happened.
So I went out, collected the duck, and before I put it in the freezer, I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex.
And here are the ducks again.
Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize.
This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast.
It's a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison.
These are pigeons in Rotterdam.
It's been there for three days, and it's laying on its back.
It's not. I show you here some slides, some frames from the video, and at the last moment before he hits the glass, he puts his feet in front, and then he bangs against the glass.
Oh, sorry.
For example, this is the sound of grass.
So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt that the software and my brain had united, because in my dreams, it was my brain creating electronic sounds. It wasn't the software, so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.
Especially the aisle with cleaning products.
So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like, Lady Gaga salads as starters. I mean, this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably.
They have similar sound of eyes.
Very yellow and very colorful, because there's many different frequencies.
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.
I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body.
You might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two.
She was wholly unconcerned about the bears, but she was terrified of lawyers.
So, they provided a bus that held 60 people and drove the three of them back and forth several hours to Laramie.
This is a doctor, whose life is caring for people.
People no longer feel free to act on their best judgment.
And of course the hindsight bias is perfect.
What does the macro-data show us?
Because they're not sure, and they don't want to take legal responsibility.
Public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in America say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom.
The other day at the State of the Union speech, President Obama said, and I think we could all agree with this goal, "From the first railroads to the interstate highway system, our nation has always been the first to compete.
Archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff, but they'll see all these labels, "Contents are extremely hot."
In the areas that are regulated, there are so many rules no human could possibly know it.
It's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders all day long, whispering in your ear, "Could that go wrong? Might that go wrong?"
Tweaking the law's clearly not good enough, and tort reform, which is a great idea, lowers your cost if you're a businessperson, but it's like a Band-Aid on this gaping wound of distrust.
And it's especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits.
And so here is the fourth proposition.
Because life is complex, and here is the hardest and biggest change: We have to restore the authority to judges and officials to interpret and apply the law.
Takes five minutes. That's it, it's not that hard.
We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom.
It's the only way to get our freedom back, and it's the only way to release the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time. Thank you.
They almost brought the entire financial system down.
Give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes, so that you don't need to rely on judges using their judgment.
Maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave.
You design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system "almost-collapse" can't happen again.
And he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems -- problems that they hadn't anticipated.
Wise people know when and how to bend the rules.
If you are a rule-bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself, what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people.
Then he lost his job.
He had never committed a crime before.
And it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life -- a happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise judge.
Judge Forer did what she was required to do, and then she quit the bench.
Third, don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted.
First, they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity.
If you reward kids for reading books, they stop caring about what's in the books and only care about how long they are.
These are people who, being forced to operate in a system that demands rule-following and creates incentives, find away around the rules, find a way to subvert the rules.
Pettengill was a 23-year-old vet who had planned to make the army a career, but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq, and that forced him to take a medical discharge.
He was in a court called the Veterans' Court.
There are now 22 cities that have Veterans' Courts like this.
The bank was profitable.
And the way they do it is to give third-year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year.
They want to have permission to do the right thing.
Rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom.
Because perception leads to your response to it.
Both are fairly bad for your health.
We've mentioned the health, but it needs consumers to buy into it.
The other thing to do is to knock the product, attack the brand myth, as we've said.
And we have to get our messaging in there.
So we've got to find a different mechanism, and one of the best mechanisms I've ever come across is the victims of terrorism.
Now, lady in 15J was a suicide bomber amongst us all.
And that is a hard thing for the head to take.
If the suicide bomber was from Wales, good luck to Wales, I'd say.
There was a famous Irish terrorist who once summed up the point very beautifully. He said, "The thing is, about the British government, is, is that it's got to be lucky all the time, and we only have to be lucky once."
It's not just [our] flesh and blood they want.
When we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists, everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots. Now it's got a title. Everyone's doing it.
Why was it effective?
New Libya has been compassionate towards those victims, and started taking it -- so it started a whole new dialogue there.
The advantages of dialogue are obvious.
It's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields.
What if the bombs are just simply wake-up calls for us?
Thank you.
And for a few years, we were the only nuclear power on Earth.
They're still probably usable. They could be "re-commissioned," but the way they count things, which is very complicated, we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before.
It stands for mutually assured destruction.
So what we offered ourselves was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things, just to jog your memories.
Or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground.
So the goal was to evacuate the target cities.
The civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we'd see in all-out nuclear war.
When the Soviet Union broke up, we effectively lost that adversary as a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part.
There are many, many sites where warheads are stored and, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials, like highly enriched uranium and plutonium, are absolutely not safe.
This is not a product placement. It's just -- in fact, if I was Coca Cola, I'd be pretty distressed about this -- -- but basically, this is it.
There's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there.
They are stateless.
The fourth element is that the high-value U.S. targets are accessible, soft and plentiful.
It becomes very portable.
I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community -- a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it's almost inevitable, unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk, like better interdiction, better prevention, better fixing, you know, better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth.
We're coming down, and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here, in the Financial District.
An enormous hurricane-like wind, and destruction of buildings almost totally, within this yellow circle here.
And what happens is -- this is -- I'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within 20 minutes, it comes straight down. Within 24 hours, lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds, and it's mostly in this particular direction -- it's going northeast.
Over the next few days to a week, there will be a radiation cloud, again, going with the wind, and settling down for another 15 or 20 miles out -- in this case, over Long Island.
We can change the survival rates by doing some commonsensical things."
You want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums don't burst from the pressures.
And then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum, but you're going to wait hopefully -- you'll have your little wind-up, battery-less radio, and you'll be waiting for people to tell you when it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do.
Thank you.
Our digital body is one-to-one life size, so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy.
So we call this the slicer mode.
What I'm going to do is I'm going to peel off all the skin, muscles and bones, just to see a few internal organs.
But fortunately, our digital man has "undo."
Since it's digital, we can do reverse dissection.
So, Anatomage Table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear in X-ray.
An elderly, white-haired man stands up.
"If 'philosophers' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term," he said, "then, by analogy with 'artist,' we may form 'scientist.'" This was the first time the word scientist was uttered in public, only 179 years ago.
These were brilliant, driven men who accomplished amazing things.
It was time for a new revolution, which they pledged to bring about, and what's so amazing about these guys is, not only did they have these grandiose undergraduate dreams, but they actually carried them out, even beyond their wildest dreams.
It made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge."
They also relentlessly lobbied the British government for the money to build Babbage's engines because they believed these engines would have a huge practical impact on society.
It had a separate memory and central processor.
Members were encouraged to bring their wives, daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association, and while the women were expected to attend only the public lectures and the social events like this one, they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well.
There's a flip side as well.
Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten, that science is not only for scientists.
But I'm going to tell you about something else today.
And he told me, "Biosignatures, we need to look for a biosignature."
But here's something."
So once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things -- so this particular person wrote a whole article and said, "Hey, these are bacteria."
Well of course, you'd go to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L.
And if you take a look at that, this was actually in a book that I wrote that deals with artificial life.
So is that life? Not as far as I'm concerned.
So having seen this work, worked a little bit on this, this is where I came in.
But what I wanted to focus on is this type of population structure.
By the way, this is highly accelerated, so it's like a thousand generations a second.
Because if we can, maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids."
But if you now look at the same distribution in English texts, it looks like that.
But first I have to ask: what are these building blocks, like the alphabet, elements that I showed you?
But suppose you take some dirt and dig through it and then put it into these spectrometers, because there's bacteria all over the place; or you take water anywhere on Earth, because it's teaming with life, and you make the same analysis; the spectrum looks completely different.
So this is the distribution that you get if, in fact, there is no life.
And so now we can see, is that really a robust signature?
And indeed, we're going to be dropping these guys into that soup all the time.
The distribution changes to "alive!"
And that in a sense removes us again, like all of our scientific discoveries, or many of them -- it's this continuous dethroning of man -- of how we think we're special because we're alive.
And I'm going to leave you with that.
I can tell you that working in global health, that is not our biggest problem.
And part of the reason why we don't know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems is what you see here.
And the problem, of course, with all of this is that with all those paper forms — and I'm telling you we have paper forms for every possible thing.
And what makes it even worse is that that's just the beginning, because once you've collected all that data, of course someone's going to have to -- some unfortunate person is going to have to type that into a computer.
Sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer, and sometimes, actually not infrequently, it actually never happens.
It kind of frightens me to think of how long ago that was.
Because if we can do that, if we can actually just collect the data electronically, digitally, from the very beginning, we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process of typing, of having somebody type that stuff into the computer.
But the problem is, 20 or 30 programs, like, training 20 or 30 programs to use this technology, that is a tiny drop in the bucket.
So what do I mean by that?
And, you know, I was thinking, how could I take myself out of the picture for quite some time.
So these guys are distributing technology.
And so I thought, what would happen if we built software to do what I'd been consulting in?
It can be a basic phone like the phone on the right there, you know, the basic kind of Symbian phone that's very common in developing countries.
And I told you that in the first few years of trying to do this the old-fashioned way, going out to each country, we reached about, I don't know, probably trained about 1,000 people.
That's less than I used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation.
And on the other side there was a rising sun.
Because in the balloon, like in life, we go very well in unforeseen directions.
How do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day?
No, the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast.
This can be in politics.
But actually I had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it.
And he told me, "Don't do that. Go down immediately in order to slow down."
We are burning, as you heard, so much energy, not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life cannot last for long.
That's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking.
We landed with 40 kilos.
It takes too much energy. It will cost too much.
If you tell to people, we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world, people will laugh at you, except here, where crazy people are invited to speak.
I think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities, that can talk to students, talk to politicians during the flight, and really make it a human adventure.
People will tell you it's impossible, and that's exactly why we try to do it.
Couple of kilos more for the wing spars.
And this is exactly the symbol of our world.
This is a painting from Magritte, in the museum in Holland that I love so much.
And this is possible. You know, with the technologies we have today, we can save between 30 and 50 percent of the energy of a country in Europe, and we can solve half of the rest with renewables.
The question I leave you with now is which is the ballast you would like to throw overboard?
At this very moment, you are viewing my upper half.
What turns me on about the digital age, what excites me personally, is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing.
Political, economic, psychological, whatever.
It was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life.
Beautiful, royal people.
And in that moment, I started this journey.
So what we're talking about here is human rights.
And that's too bad, because we're very good at charity.
It questions our commitment.
You see, it's not as dramatic as the tsunami.
Every week, religious extremists take another African village.
There's an opportunity here, and it's real.
The neon sign is fizzing and cracking.
As a person who buys the products.
And because we can, we must.
Look at the Gates Foundation.
This room was born for this moment, is really what I want to say to you tonight.
This equality business is actually a pain in the arse.
And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast, there was muscle to the movement that started out here.
We believe this is one.
But some of them they haven't.
What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts, that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa, by America and by the world.
As I say, there're two things on the line here.
When the history books get written, I think our age will be remembered for three things.
You see, if this is true, and I believe it is, that the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter, this should be a piece of piss.
You know, there's lots out there.
If there's one million Americans -- and I really know this -- who are ready to make phone calls, who are ready to be on email, I am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history, literally, for the continent of Africa.
Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars.
Every three seconds one person dies.
We can start to make poverty history.
I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that.
The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years.
We utter about six metaphors a minute.
She is not she, but a buttercup.
But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else, we give it a whole network of analogies too.
Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns; it is the creation of patterns.
Does that correspond?
Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia, in which we understand one concept in the context of another.
They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences.
Agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing, as in, "The NASDAQ climbed higher."
Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies.
Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.
But before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor.
The mind is a plastic snow dome, the most beautiful, most interesting, and most itself, when, as Elvis put it, it's all shook up.
So many people are there.
Yemenis are using cartoons and art, paintings, comics, to tell the world and each other about what's going on.
And they do, in many ways, tell a different story than the story of Yemen, the one that is often in the news.
But there's so much potential.
And in my third year, I started becoming confused because I was Yemeni, but I was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college.
"What's this young girl coming in and showing off because it's her family business," or something.
And we have a more gender-balanced newsroom today.
PM: And we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper.
And the more empowered the women become, the more they are able to remove the veil, for example, or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel.
A lot of young girls look up to me.
Some of my reporters were arrested.
It's not fair for me; it's not fair for my country.
PM: Yes, you are.
So it's about the lack of research, basically.
PM: Nadia, I think you've just given us a very different view of Yemen.
Thank you.
But I was not limited when I sang, and as air came up from my lungs, through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound, it was the closest thing I had ever come to transcendence.
And I gave up salt, I went vegan, and I started taking huge doses of sildenafil, also known as Viagra.
If you go through a metal detector, you'll probably die.
And the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers.
My father had been in a catastrophic car accident, and he died.
My fingers started turning blue, and I was like, "What is going on here?"
We're not big on fear in my family, but I was scared.
I officially took a break from singing, and I went to the Cleveland Clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years, for transplant.
But the next morning, while I was still in the hospital, I got a telephone call.
The last thing I remember was lying on a white blanket, telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again, and to please try and save my voice.
If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again.
I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk, I couldn't eat, I couldn't move, I certainly couldn't sing, I couldn't even breathe, but when I looked up and I saw my mother, I couldn't help but smile.
And I wanted to tell her, and I want to tell you, we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams.
No, I'm just joking.
So for example, in the United Kingdom, the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by 20 percent just in a generation.
So a real skyrocketing of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes, premature puberty.
These are the dissected gonads of an animal that has two testes, two ovaries, another large testis, more ovaries, which is not normal ...
Normally the testes should make testosterone, the male hormone.
And so I find it interesting that instead of treating this disease by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it, we simply respond by putting more chemicals into the environment.
But just two weeks before that, the U.S. Senate refused to even debate the banning of BPA in babies' bottles and sippy cups.
80 percent of all amphibians are threatened and in come decline.
Of those that don't abort, atrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development in the exposed daughters in utero, so that their breast don't develop properly.
And it's interesting when you make a film like this, because you're stuck trying to visualize science that there's no visualization for.
P And neither had I actually before I started making this film.
So my child's death, my baby's death, really brought home the resonance of what I was trying to make in this film.
It's not just my work in amphibians, but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe, holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America and in rats, an absence of sperm in the testicular tubules as well.
It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us, just like Rachel Carson and others have warned.
We know what we're putting out there, we have a sense of those repercussions, but we are so ignorant of this sense of what happens when we put things, or things are put into our bodies.
Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest.
A large, unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea.
Also, the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic, polypropylene.
but, mostly bottle caps.
I thought I would spend 20 bucks.
Now, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this.
But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish.
Anchor: He offers no hope of cleaning it up.
And that's changed, because we've had a huge shift in the balance of power from the news organizations to the audience.
And that's changed now because, as journalists, we interact in real time. We're not in a position where the audience is reacting to news.
So 60 seconds was how long it took for the physical earthquake to travel.
So it's an interesting position to be in as a journalist, because we should have access to everything.
But joking aside, there were images like this one from Instagram which was subjected to a grilling by journalists.
And finding the source becomes more and more important -- finding the good source -- and Twitter is where most journalists now go.
And as the conversation grew and grew, it became more and more lively, and eventually you were left with this huge, big, rhythmic pointer of this conversation.
And this video, which I'm going to let run through, was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago.
But we started looking, and we used free Internet tools to do so.
So we were able to call Rita, clear the video, make sure that it had been shot, and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried.
They said, one, the bridge doesn't exist.
That's blood in the river. So the river is flowing south to north. That's what that tells me.
We start to see that it's got a median, so it's a two-lane bridge.
But what it tells me is that, at a time when there's more -- there's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been, it's harder to filter, we have greater tools.
The north coast of California has rainforests -- temperate rainforests -- where it can rain more than 100 inches a year.
You can see the range of the Coast Redwoods. It's here, in red.
It's a kind loaner from TED.
Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time.
That is to say, at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees.
Now, I had been working on other topics: the emergence of infectious diseases, which come out of the natural ecosystems of the Earth, make a trans-species jump, and get into humans.
All other primates, when they're scared, they run up a tree, where they feel safe.
You ascend 30 stories.
These are huckleberry bushes.
They also have a feature: thickets of huckleberry bushes that grow out of the tops of Redwood trees that are technically known as huckleberry afros, and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting.
This three-dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar, made by Steve Sillett, Marie Antoine and their colleagues, gives you an idea.
We're looking at that yellow box.
They've wired them like patients in an ICU.
There are some interesting theories that, if I had time, I would tell you about.
In the 1950s, a small organism appeared in Richmond, Virginia, called the Hemlock woolly adelgid.
One of the things that is just -- I almost can't conceive it -- is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all, and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America.
Thank you very much.
You've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening, and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever.
This is an ambucycle.
We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes.
I helped many people, but whenever someone really needed help, I never got there in time. We never got there.
If this doctor, who lived one block away from there, would have come 20 minutes earlier, not have to wait until that siren he heard before coming from the ambulance, if he would have heard about it way before, he would have saved this child.
And he said to me — I remember this like yesterday — he was a great guy, but he said to me, "Kid, go to school, or go open a falafel stand.
The next day, while I was listening to the scanners, I heard about a call coming in of a 70-year-old man hurt by a car only one block away from me on the main street of my neighborhood.
At that moment, when I realized this is the first person I ever saved in my life after two years volunteering in an ambulance, I knew this is my life's mission.
Thousands of passionate volunteers who will leave everything they do and run to help people they don't even know.
These ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels.
I said to myself, I saw so much tragedy, so much hate, and it's not about saving Jews. It's not about saving Muslims.
And these are all volunteers.
I don't think it existed, but I never imagined, I never imagined that it's going to go all around, it's going to spread around, and this last year we started in Panama and Brazil.
And we made a difference.
Think about all the services we use, all the connectivity, all the entertainment, all the business, all the commerce.
And we actually know where Brain came from.
Now it's 2011.
You want to guess who opened the door?
So there is some sort of justice in the world after all.
You know that you're infected because it actually shows up.
So we can actually see in real time that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere.
It's gangs like -- let's go to GangstaBucks.com.
Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.
One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations: we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons.
And they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build.
Now, criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before can reach us.
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.
That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature.
So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg, and through a long road, we eventually found this one particular website.
In downtown St. Petersburg, he actually crashed his car into another car.
The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence, or for some reason we can't take them down.
For example, the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these.
We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail.
I've spent my life defending the Net, and I do feel that if we don't fight online crime, we are running a risk of losing it all.
And the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we're doing; it's not just wisdom or guesswork.
I don't have a clue.
Now who is rational?
If you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior, with regard to producing pollutants, one approach, the common approach, is to exhort them to be better, to explain to them what damage they're doing to the planet.
Each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them, so they can advise the president.
That's a complicated problem; that's a lot to know.
Nobody can keep that straight in their head.
You may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much.
And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things.
We can get this information from the Internet, from The Economist, The Financial Times, The New York Times, U.S. News and World Report, lots of sources like that, or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems, because those experts know this information.
You take a look at this, this is not based on statistics.
It would achieve some national pride, but not go ahead and build a weapon.
How is this happening?
They are growing in political clout, as the mullahs are isolating themselves -- with the exception of one group of mullahs, who are not well known to Americans.
And the reason that being able to predict those things is important, is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it, but because if you can predict what people will do, you can engineer what they will do.
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: I've thought about that, and since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community, they've also pondered that.

But how do we know that the user's video was a copy?
When we find a match, we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down.
Well, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts, and that looked like the end of the story, but sometime last year, a young couple got married.
And the song, 18 months old, went back to number four on the iTunes charts.
So why has no one ever solved this problem before?
But the system only works through the participation of rights owners.
As a child, I was raised by native Hawaiian elders -- three old women who took care of me while my parents worked.
These women are descendants of Polynesian navigators, trained in the old ways by their elders, and now they're passing it on to me.
People will forget their wisdom.
Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me.
Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the Pacific without the use of instruments.
The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance.
It's humanity's DNA.
This I know intimately, because even as I travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them, I struggle.
You cannot make the voyage alone, you were never meant to.
My challenge is: the shortest seminar I usually do is 50 hours.
Or are you running the same pattern? Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive, activated, is the most important thing in the world.
And so it's wonderful for us to think intellectually about how the life of the world is, and especially those who are very smart -- we can play this game in our head.
And I've got to do something right now to get the result or nothing matters. I get the phone call when the child is going commit suicide, and I've got to do something right now. And in 29 years -- I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one in 29 years.
But the other lesson of life that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment.
What is it that shapes us? And we live in a therapy culture.
Audience: Aye.
You may not have the money; you may not have the Supreme Court; but that is not the defining factor.
So, emotion is it. And if we get the right emotion, we can get ourselves to do anything. We can get through it.
What determines your resources? We've said decisions shape destiny, which is my focus here. If decisions shape destiny, what determines it is three decisions. What are you going to focus on?
So the bottom line is, maybe it was where to go to work, and you met the love of your life there.
It wasn't the end; it was the beginning. What am I going to do?
Have you ever done something, after you did it, you go, "That was me!"
You can get your desires or goals. How many have ever got a goal or desire and thought, is this all there is?
Everyone needs certainty that they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable. Now, how do you get it?
Audience: Aye.
Zero to 10. How high? 10. How certain am I that you're going to respond to me? 10. How much uncertainty?
If you don't raise your hand, you'll have had other shit too, come on.
If you don't grow, you're what? If a relationship's not growing, if a business is not growing, if you're not growing, it doesn't matter how much money you have, how many friends you have, how many people love you, you feel like hell. And the reason we grow, I believe, is so we have something to give of value.
I said, "Focus on: 'there's food'" -- what a concept, you know.
Now, 18 years later, I'm proud to tell you, last year we fed two million people in 35 countries through our foundation, all during the holidays: Thanksgiving, Christmas -- -- in all the different countries around the world.
And the last one I've already mentioned, that fell to you.
When 9/11 happened -- I'll finish with this -- I was in Hawaii.
Don't let anything ever stop you." She finishes, and a man stands up and he says, "I'm from Pakistan; I'm a Muslim.
She said, "Yes." Guilty people got guilty, sad people got sad.
So I've been busy with a couple of projects, and one of them was this: The Nutmeg.
And it appears that, some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night, until she reappeared in the morning.
I think people are very similar, but I also think that we have trouble seeing that.
This, also, is nothing new.
All of this information is saved in a database that collects about 20,000 feelings a day.
So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions.
And then, one by one, in reverse chronological order, they excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.
This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings in the last few hours, if you will.
And we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.
They're feeling "warm" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on.
You can see the little pink cursor moving along, representing our position.
"I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to."
Another technique is directly questioning people.
There are two modes to the time capsule.
And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky, and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories.
If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?
So you see this kind of -- these stars moving along.
This is the universe of 2007, the last two months.
We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those.
So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained to all things Bill Clinton.
We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach of Bill Clinton in the last week or so.
And there are also quotes that you can see, if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.

"A cloud over the cloud," was the headline.
Who here can't remember thinking, well, looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids?
And you look up and what do you see?
But one thing I do know is this: The bad press that clouds get is totally unfair.
It's composed entirely of ice crystals cascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere, and as these ice crystals fall, they pass through different layers with different winds and they speed up and slow down, giving the cloud these brush-stroked appearances, these brush-stroke forms known as fall streaks.
When the wind passes, rises to pass over the mountain, it can take on a wave-like path in the lee of the peak, with these clouds hovering at the crest of these invisible standing waves of air, these flying saucer-like forms, and some of the early black-and-white UFO photos are in fact lenticularis clouds. It's true.
Clouds are the most egalitarian of nature's displays, because we all have a good, fantastic view of the sky.
But from down below, they are the embodiment of the powerful, elemental force and power that drives our atmosphere.
All those cloud shapes at the beginning, those were cumulus clouds.
We need to be reminded by these patron goddesses of idle fellows that slowing down and being in the present, not thinking about what you've got to do and what you should have done, but just being here, letting your imagination lift from the everyday concerns down here and just being in the present, it's good for you, and it's good for the way you feel.
It uses X-rays, X-ray beams, that are rotating very fast around the human body.
And I've taken the liberty, just for clarity, to translate that to data slices.
So this is really the enormous challenge that we have.
So this is really what we're doing.
I want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver.
So please go back home, tell your kids to play more games, because that's what I need.
So this is really what's enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine, together with some really nifty work in terms of algorithms -- compressing data, extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on.
And of course all the data is inside, so I can start rotating, I can look at it from different angles, and I can see that this woman had a problem.
We're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner, and just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set.
And then the radiologist, together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist, looks at the data that's coming out, and they have a joint session.
And this women also ended up under the car, so she's quite badly beaten up by this injury.
Here you can see that knife went through the heart.
It actually looks like this, just to give you a feeling for what it looks like.
There's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this, if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies.
I have this pen, and I look at the data, and I move the pen towards the head, and all of a sudden I feel resistance.
And this is Karljohan, one of my graduate students who's been working on this project.
And we heard a little bit about functional MRI.
And this is a little bit freaky, because what Motts is seeing is actually this.
And then he's going backwards.
For 20 seconds he's going like that, and all of a sudden it lights up up here.
And I can do very nice images like this.
It was kind of hard to get it in.
So thank you very much.
So I thought I'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why I lead this schizophrenic life.
Well, 80 percent of the men in Lesotho worked in the mines over the border, in brutal conditions.
But there was one little boy, very small for his age.
Another one is that I met a miner. He was home on his three-month leave from the mines.
We can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line.
"Everyone talks about the Big Bang. What banged?"
And I'll just share a cartoon of this idea here.
Well, I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question.
So, to cut a long story short, we've explored this alternative.
We need to make the best mathematical models we can, the most consistent ones.
Africa was gripped by poverty, disease and war.
Then there's HIV/AIDS. And then there are deaths from war.
Well, the transition to democracy in South Africa in 1994 was literally a dream come true for many of us.
And let's recruit students from the whole of Africa, bring them together with lecturers from all over the world, and we'll try to give them a fantastic education.
Well, the new South Africa is a very exciting country.
And we got lots of applicants.
And then they're up again at eight in the morning.
And they've all gone on to master's and Ph.D. degrees in excellent places.
We're well on the way to achieving our initial goal.
And I'll let her take it from there.
And he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher.
Here's somebody you've seen already.
Well, it's not my TED wish; it's our wish, as you've already gathered.
Each will have a pan-African student body, but specialize in a different area of science.
Everyone wants an AIMS center in their country.
Easy to remember the basic rules we need.
I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory, the RAM and the ALU, the arithmetic and logic unit.
Let's take a look at some numbers.
This is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain.
So the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency?
You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other -- about 100 million of them, sending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second.
So I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno: "the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them."
And when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device.
But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady -- it's a sporadic flow of current.
Now, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much.
And the only kind of thing -- the only thing we know right now that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.
So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered, it doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part with these redundant connections.
In fact, the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the Internet.
And the chip -- I'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul, who's the student who designed this chip.
And these four types of information -- your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it, and 900,000 of those fibers send these four types of information.
When you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts.
Question for you, Kwabena.
And I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion, to come up with new things, because you're coming from a different perspective.
And the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist.
So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about an object that's supermassive, and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment, it has no finite size.
At that point gravity wins.
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.
Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole; I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.
There are big ones. There are little ones.
And we call them that because their nucleus, or their center, are very active.
So, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies.
And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened, disk-like structure.
It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit.
This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court.
So, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.
Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on that little square there.
Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible, take 500 years.
But with this experiment, we've confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that's 10,000 times smaller.
So, what next? I actually think this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology, so let's move on with the problem.
A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.
Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today, we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.
To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away.
So, we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting.
Now Ted was a New Yorker, an all-around theater guy, and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician.
And the thing about classical music, that what and how, it's inexhaustible."
Brah dada dadadadah."
It's all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches.
They're locations in the spectrum of sound.
And in classical music we can follow these changes very, very accurately because of the music's powerful silent partner, the way it's been passed on: notation.
Now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized, made into intricate designs.
So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big 'what' was to praise God.
MTT: This, of course, was the birth of opera, and its development put music on a radical new course.
37 freakin' vibrations.
And in these big architectures of time, composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime.
Is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude?
And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes, using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences.
I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home, and I spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker.
But now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music.
If you're curious, if you have a capacity for wonder, if you're alive, you know all that you need to know.
But kites aren't just toys like this.
And their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion, where we powered up and took off for the first-ever 12-second human flight.
Wind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar: 3600 terawatts, more than enough to supply humanity 200 times over.
And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either.
If you'd loan me your Gulfstream, I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt.
So really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people with these dreams. There are many of us.
I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone.
So, actually, if you listen carefully, there's supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.
And this year I composed a Romantic style.
Like, am I going to use one page?
You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.
Oh, D and F -- too familiar.
I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.
But recently, I've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds, because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool.
Here's a clue.
You know, a while after TEDTalks started taking off, we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation.
You turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn.
It's based on hundreds of hours of research, of practice.
There's millions connected.
And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting: because you can see the best, everyone can learn.
I don't think we're going to see terrorists, for example, publishing their plans online and saying to the world, "Please, could you help us to actually make them work this time?"
We are learning from them.
It's also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation.
Humanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day.
But looking at video clips posted by strangers, a world of possibility opens up for him.
It can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in print.
It's actually faster to read than to view.
That's what's made it into this mysterious, powerful thing it is.
It's not too much to say that what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication.
I mean, the world's universities are opening up their curricula.
I mean, does it have to be this painful, top-down process?
But the good news is they are out there.
I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown.
We have our own film school.
Right now, Chris and Kevin and Dennis and Dickson and their friends are watching us, in Nairobi, right now.
To find this out, I looked at three things: I looked at the topic that you should choose, I looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage.
TED is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock, so they're going to hate me for revealing this, because, actually, you should talk as long as they will let you.
Secondly, it's imperative that you do not cite The New York Times.
And now the most important thing, that is the mood onstage.
And the TEDPad is a matrix of 100 specifically selected, highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk.
Everyone has relationships with other people, and they're interested in these relationships for a variety of reasons.
Okay, so what? In fact, the so what is, in the brain, changes in neural activity, the things that make your brain work, the things that make your software work in your brain, are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow.
Okay, let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do, and it's in the area of what you'd call valuation.
I won't go through the details of it, but that's an important discovery, and we know a good bit about that now, and it's just a small piece of it, but it's important because those are the neurons that you would lose if you had Parkinson's disease, and they're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally every drug of abuse, and that makes sense.
These same valuation systems are redeployed when we're valuing interactions with other people.
Now, the elements of the scene also communicate this to us, but you can read it straight off their faces, and if you compare their faces to normal faces, it would be a very subtle cue.
They keep you alive. It gives them the pie, it gives that kind of a behavioral punch which we've called a superpower.
So a rational choice economist would say, well, you should take all non-zero offers.
You have to stand up in the moment to do that.
When methane built up, or carbon dioxide built up, or oxygen was diminished, the birds would swoon before people would -- so it acted as an early warning system: Hey, get out of the mine. Things aren't going so well.
We synchronize the machines, set them into these staged social interactions, and we eavesdrop on both of the interacting brains. So for the first time, we don't have to look at just averages over single individuals, or have individuals playing computers, or try to make inferences that way. We can study individual dyads.
The interesting thing about studying cognition has been that we've been limited, in a way.
There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians.
So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money -- you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing by spending more money, you can only measure progress by spending money -- you're going to have a pretty miserable time.
And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today, I think you can completely, as I've said, remake politics, remake government, remake your public services.
Thought he could turn back the waves; couldn't turn back the waves.
And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are.
So we're now living in a post-bureaucratic age, where genuine people power is possible.
Now here, on one website, one state in America, every single dollar spent by that government is searchable, is analyzable, is checkable.
And the third of these big changes: accountability.
We're working with some of these people.
Look at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics.
Obviously, here we have JFK with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation, "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country," an incredibly noble sentiment.
Thank you.
When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get, we were blown away.
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve.
Eleven out of 14.
It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession.
Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea?
Let's talk about what's going on today.
You can't really dispute what you see on the video, and there is a lot to be learned from that, and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this.
If I don't write things down, I don't remember them.
But we still have more work to do.
Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective, it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries.
Thank you.
In 2009, I first heard about DIYbio.
None of my previous experience prepared me for what came next. Can you guess?
There's one probably going to open up in Moscow, one in South Korea, and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of.
We make things grow.
Now, we follow state and local regulations.
There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion.
Yep, you guessed it. He threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs, analyzed the saliva, identified the dog, and confronted the dog owner.
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell.
If you had spaces like this all over the world, it could really change the perception of who's allowed to do biotech.
And so it invited workers from around the world to come and help it build the nation.
What on earth did this man do to merit this treatment?
Today we can prevent the transmission of HIV.
You know better than anyone that HIV brings out the best and the worst in humanity.
Unfortunately, these good laws are counter-balanced by a mass of really bad law -- law which is grounded in moral judgement and in fear and in misinformation, laws which specifically punish people living with HIV or those at greatest risk.
You are a very, very, very bad person.
And this is exactly what happened to Helma and Dongo from Namibia.
They didn't give the forms to me or explain what was in the form.
Looking globally, the number of new infections of HIV is declining.
It's for this reason that the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, of which I'm a member, was established by the agencies of the United Nations -- to look at the ways that legal environments are affecting people living with HIV and those at greatest risk, and to recommend what should be done to make the law an ally, not an enemy, of the global response to HIV.
There is, however, ample evidence to show that incarcerating people increases their risk of HIV and other infections.
At the Global Commission we have studied the evidence, and we've heard the experiences of over 700 people from 140 countries.
But there's plenty you can do while that process is underway.
And also important is talking to communities so that we change interpretations of religious or customary law, which is too often used to justify punishment and fuel stigma.
Settlements typically began with people clustered around a well, and the size of that settlement was roughly the distance you could walk with a pot of water on your head.
Production was centralized in assembly plants.
So you have the sprawl of LA, the sprawl of Mexico City.
Cities are places of celebration, personal expression.
So this is my image of the city of the future.
Most of what people need in life can be within a five- or 10-minute walk.
This can also be a resilient electrical microgrid, community heating, power, communication networks, etc., can be concentrated there.
They took the elevated highway, they got rid of it, they reclaimed the street, the river down below, below the street, and you can go from one end of Seoul to the other without crossing a pathway for cars.
But shared use is really key. If you share a vehicle, you can have at least four people use one vehicle, as opposed to one.
So what's interesting is, then if you begin to add new things to it, like autonomy, you get out of the car, you park at your destination, you pat it on the butt, it goes and it parks itself, it charges itself, and you can get something like seven times as many vehicles in a given area as conventional cars, and we think this is the future. Actually we could do this today.
This is an early design for this little three-wheel, it's an electronic bike. You have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane, but if you're an older person, that's a switch. If you're a healthy person, you might have to work really hard to go fast.
You have guests over, you have two guestrooms that are developed.
We think this can all be standardized, and then people can personalize the stuff that goes into that wall, and like the car, we can integrate all kinds of sensing to be aware of human activity, so if there's a baby or a puppy in the way, you won't have a problem.
In this case, a project we're doing with Siemens, we have sensors on all the furniture, all the infill, that understands where people are and what they're doing.
In this case, she picks up her phone, she can map food preparation at the kitchen island to a particular location of sunlight. An algorithm will keep it in that location as long as she's engaged in that activity.
We think ultimately all of this stuff can come together, a new model for mobility, a new model for housing, a new model for how we live and work, a path to market for advanced technologies, but in the end the main thing we need to focus on are people. Cities are all about people.
Some say up to five tons.
A third of the size of the basking shark is their liver, and it's full of oil.
And sharks used to come into the bay.
Maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year.
The black, you can't really see this, but these are Norwegian basking shark hunting vessels, and the black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel rather than a whaling vessel.
But more commonly all around the island, they were known as the sunfish.
They're not protected in Ireland.
So we concentrated mainly in North Donegal and West Kerry as the two areas where I was mainly active.
I'll show you what they look like.
And you have to kind of reconstruct the path.
That's nine and a half thousand kilometers. We never thought that happened.
And that's why it's great to have collaboration.
We had no idea, did they distinguish into different populations?
They found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world's oceans of basking sharks.
8,000 animals in the world.
There's only 8,000 basking shark females in the world?
That's banned now, and that'll be good news for the sharks.
And that was fine. We got wet. No problem.
So that wasn't going to work.
And he was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Later, later, later."
And I wrapped the oven cleaner around the end of the mop handle and was desperate, desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks.
And in about half an hour, we got five samples, five individual sharks, were sampled using Simon's shark slime sampling system.
And what you're trying to look at is the males have claspers, which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark.
And you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can.

As part of selling, I was able to document the hard core evidence.
One story that comes to mind in my undercover pieces is "Spirit Child."
Don't forget the key principles: naming, shaming and jailing.
I am glad today the Tanzanian government has taken action, but the key issue is that the Tanzanian government could only take action because the evidence was available.
So with my hidden intention, I kept quiet.
The next moment, you see the money in my hands, counting, whereas I have not come into contact with anybody.
AA That was my president.
So I was in the prison. ["Nsawan Prison"] Now, what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies.
Evil in the society is an extreme disease.
By the end of it, a lot more bad guys on our continent will be put behind bars.
So someone sued you in court, and they took you there, and you were in remand custody for part of it, and you did that deliberately.
I mean, everybody has their hazard.
What's your name? Where are you from?
We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves.
So here's a disclaimer about me, though, before we get too deep into this.
So I went home, and I shaved my head, and I came back the next day and I said, "I'm a boy."
In fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl -- not my teachers at school, not my friends, not the directors that I worked with.
But in my particular case, I just woke up one day when I was 14, and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again.
So four, almost five years ago, Proposition 8, the great marriage equality debate, was raising a lot of dust around this country.
And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority, and in my own home country, based on one facet of my character.
And then it occurred to me, perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do.
So I ran out in the freezing cold, and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago.
It's written in the Declaration of Independence.
I want to take the project across the country.
I know that this is a talk, but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them.
In fact, on the contrary, it highlights them.
Once they got over the shock, though, by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks.
Because, for example, if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior, where exactly do you draw the line?
Because really, they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are.
So please don't greet us as strangers, greet us as your fellow human beings, period.
So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson, that wasn't fiction.
It tells me something else. If you remember, God's favorite angel was Lucifer.
So the Lucifer effect, although it focuses on the negatives -- the negatives that people can become, not the negatives that people are -- leads me to a psychological definition. Evil is the exercise of power.
"Don't blame us. It's not the system. It's the few bad apples, the few rogue soldiers."
Because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera, they took pictures of everything. More than 1,000.
Let's go down to that dungeon.
Who are the bad apples?" Well, that's a bad question.
Is there a stage director?"
And it's a dynamic interplay.
Like yourself, I'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not, depending on the circumstances."
"We're going to give you five bucks -- four dollars for your time."
And one of you is told by the authority, the guy in the lab coat, "Your job as teacher is to give this guy material to learn.
"Sir, who's going to be responsible if something happens to him?"
Two thirds go all the way to 450 volts. This was just one study.
912 American citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in Guyana jungle in 1978, because they were blindly obedient to this guy, their pastor -- not their priest -- their pastor, Reverend Jim Jones.
We did interviews. Picked two dozen: the most normal, the most healthy.
It was a real cop car, it was a real policeman, and there were real neighbors in the street, who didn't know that this was an experiment.
They're going to become numbers.
Does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not?
If they don't change their appearance, only one of eight kills, tortures or mutilates.
Passive tolerance to evil through inaction or indifference.
James Schlesinger -- and I'm going to have to end with this -- says, "Psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances."
The shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual.
We want kids to think, I'm the hero in waiting, waiting for the right situation to come along, and I will act heroically.
He was the one that stopped those abuses you saw, because when he saw those images, he turned them over to a senior investigating officer.
And I ended the study the next day.
Heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary. Who act.
You know what? They freeze.
And so one day, you will be in a new situation.
So I want to thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
We would have no access to love or to the ability to create.
And one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that we have imaging technologies that now allow us to go inside the human brain and be able to do, for example, what you're seeing right now.
At any rate, what is consciousness?
We have selves.
And it's quite clear that, in order to make minds, we need to construct neural maps.
I look at the grid and I see a warping at the edge of my central-left field.
So just think of this: you have a grid of neurons, and now you have a plane mechanical change in the position of the grid, and you get a warping of your mental experience.
So it provides certain areas for perception and image-making.
So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this.
So we have an in-built system within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity.
And it is within that region that I'm going to highlight now that we have this housing of all the life-regulation devices of the body.
And people are, in fact, imprisoned within their own bodies, but they do have a mind.
And you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with the profusion of images that are, in fact, the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to, as we should, because that's really the film that is rolling in our minds.
That's where the difference is.
The autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made; it's the lived past and the anticipated future.
Three reasons. First, curiosity.
So that's a very good reason beyond curiosity to justify what we're doing, and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains.
At this ripe old age of 30, I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible, beautiful time, and I've decided, for me, it's been a real journey and paradox.
The trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet, not a businessman, but the intention was really good.
I decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label.
But for me, so is immigration.
We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail fired from a Big Ten school.
We are thousands of women and men across this country doing online writing, community organizing, changing institutions from the inside out -- all continuing the incredible work that our mothers and grandmothers started.
It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed.
Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well.
So she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact.
This isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams.
The activists I interviewed had nothing in common, literally, except for one thing, which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences.
Some attribute this golden world knowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras.
My goal, quite simply, is to help people become more in tune with themselves.
And we feel like we have to get far, far away to a secluded retreat, leaving it all behind.
So when you think about it, we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there.
This is actually a brainwave sensor that's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk.
For instance, what if I could use this data to find out how relaxed I am at any moment?
This new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves.
We created technology and applications that engaged people's imaginations, and it was really exciting.
And it could join into the relationship with you.
Let me show you an example of what I'm talking about here.
The more you focus, the faster the rotation.
It understands what's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information to move you forward.
Perhaps even more importantly, thought-controlled computing can give children with ADD insights into their own fluctuating mental states, so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs.
Or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention, just like this.
What thought-controlled computing can allow you to do is build colorful layered pictures of our lives.
One moment it was all white space, pure possibility.
Do you know what I wanted to be?
So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun.
Well, if anybody says country music isn't powerful, let me tell you this: I got there because my father's passion for Johnny Cash and a song, "A Boy Named Sue."
See this hand?
My ability and my potential.
You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive."
And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener.
And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world, where you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best.
We all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure.
And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell.
And that eye specialist, he didn't bother testing my eyes.
I couldn't even speak I was so choked up.
And that silence just outside a doctor's office, that many of us know.
I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with.
What am I going to be?"
What did you want to be when you were little? Do you love what you do?
And nobody can tell me no.
I know how to be Mowgli.
Nine months later, after that day on snot rock, I had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi.
When I came home off that elephant, do you know what the most amazing part was?
It just seemed that it was possible.
This is me, all of me.
And stop with the labels, the limiting.
And when I do, it's as a bit of a know-it-all.
I now have a 10-year-old of my own who's exactly the same.
So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch "Jeopardy."
I studied computers because I heard that was the thing, and I became a computer programmer -- not an especially good one, not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on "Jeopardy" in 2004.
I just love "Jeopardy," and I always have.
And I thought, well this is going to be child's play.
And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud.
We were not playing in L.A. on the regular "Jeopardy" set.
And we realized right away that the computer had a big home court advantage.
It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer.
You don't need human assistants for that anymore.
Here's the one thing that I was ever good at, and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and they could do the same thing.
Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that?
Being a Renaissance man or woman, that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance.
Do I take this job or that one?
The other issue is the advantage of time that you have if you have all these things at your fingertips.
But not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach, because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before.
It's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met.
I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete.
This is a question of leadership, because it becomes a question of who leads the future.
That's where the people you see on "Jeopardy" come from.
It's something that's, since it was invented a year or two ago, has given me untold happiness.
So the power of reframing things cannot be overstated.
In England the upper middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly, because they've re-branded unemployment.
It's exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box, but it has no control over the circumstances.
You know, pay 20,000 pounds in tax toward health and you're merely feeling a mug.
I think that's true actually.
And what that means is that in looking at solutions, we've probably given too much priority to what I call technical engineering solutions, Newtonian solutions, and not nearly enough to the psychological ones.
You have to go in and you have to have a cost-benefit analysis, a feasibility study, an ROI study and so forth.
Here's a beautiful example of a psychological solution deployed in Korea.
This is all I'm asking for really in human decision making, is the consideration of these three things.
Google understood that if you're just a search engine, people assume you're a very, very good search engine.
Don't give them 24 white pills.
What would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money to cross the bridge, but go through a lane that's an express lane?
So where economists make the fundamental mistake is they think that money is money.
They believed that there was a discipline called praxeology, which is a prior discipline to the study of economics.
There's the real value, which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service, and then there's a kind of dubious value, which you create by changing the way people look at things.
And the idea that one of them should actually have priority over the other is fundamentally wrong.
the average answer, or the modal answer would have been 50 to 60 percent.
The only thing they don't expect is they're uniting Europe through a shared mild hatred of the French and Germans.
And so perception actually is leaky in any case.
You know, I like to call it "the national automobile slum."
And when you degrade the public realm, you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there.
You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town.
And I want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq, spilling their blood in the sand, and ask yourself, "What is their last thought of home?"
You know, in these places in other cultures, people just go there voluntarily because they like them.
This is the other side of the building.
Because this was perceived to be a weather problem.
That -- that is the message of this form of architecture.
They haven't learned that in Monterey.
I call them "nature Band-Aids" because there's a general idea in America that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.
They're not the same thing.
And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.
We're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.
This is a real school!
We're going to have to do something else instead.
We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years, excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage by our parents' generation after World War II.
Some of them we're going to fix, though.
And America's not prepared.
Consumers are different than citizens.
They were blank on one side, and on the other side I listed some simple instructions.
You can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets.
This one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard.
And sometimes afterwards I'll stick around and sign books and take photos with students.
He pays me a lot to keep it a secret."
I read some to her, she reads some to me."
And she turned to him and said, "Is that our cat?"
Matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they've found, memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos.
Thank you for making your site.
One young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother.
Thank you.
Sometimes I share that information, yeah.
Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived, and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around.
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear.
Yay!
So firstly, thinking just about precognition, as it turns out, just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate students, and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said, "Okay, well, fair enough, but I think that's a fluke, that's a freak, because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that undergraduate students had precognitive powers, it probably wouldn't get published in a journal.
And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem, because it is a problem, because it sends us all down blind alleys, their first recommendation of how to fix this problem is to make it easier to publish negative results in science, and to change the incentives so that scientists are encouraged to post more of their negative results in public.
Now actually, in 1993, the researchers who did that 1980 study, that early study, published a mea culpa, an apology to the scientific community, in which they said, "When we carried out our study in 1980, we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance."
And I'm a very nerdy doctor, so I read all of the studies that I could on this drug. I read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo, and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant, and because this patient hadn't done well on those other antidepressants, I thought, well, reboxetine is just as good. It's one to try.
So that's not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs, because we can never know if we have those, but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization.
About half of all trials, on average, go missing in action, and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings.
And when that responsibility is diffused between a whole network of researchers, academics, industry sponsors, journal editors, for some reason we find it more acceptable, but the effect on patients is damning.
And the most staggering thing of all of this, to me, is that not only is this a problem, not only do we recognize that this is a problem, but we've had to suffer fake fixes.
This is a disaster.
It wasn't until we really left Earth, got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself, that we could understand our planet as a limited condition.
I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live, and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology.
Coming back quickly, we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning, but these are positions, the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped, and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.
We have a growing user base of this, and we network domes.
This is Nepal and Tibet.
Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.
One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera.
It's very, very important.
So we know, for instance, that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to.
It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community.
I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have, from ourselves to the outside world.
These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character, Simon Powers, and his family. There are a whole series of them, kind of like a Greek chorus.
And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System.
And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage, so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like.
So, turned out he's a fantastic composer, and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many, many pieces.
And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know, the design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking; in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making.
And so that's what we'll do today.
He can place those exactly where he wants.
So, are we ready Adam?
And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men -- stay with me -- so that you can't hear the song, and then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that I can listen and we can all sail by unaffected."
I want to hear that song. Untie me."
If you do that tomorrow, I'll be dead, you'll be dead, every single one of the men will be dead.
There is first, the present self.
It's physically possible to lose weight.
It doesn't even have a lawyer present.
And when you try to execute these commitment devices, you realize the devil is really in the details.
So ultimately, I just decided I would leave it in an envelope on the subway.
I think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle.
And this is a timely issue.
And we're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers, the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they're in retirement.
And I'll show you some of these tools right here.
It means that you have to save more today.
Now people are motivated through emotions, but different people find different things motivating.
So what we do is we take pictures of people -- in this case, college-age people -- and we use software to age them and show these people what they'll look like when they're 60, 70, 80 years old.
Other conditions show people the future self.
And slowly, slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate.
This use of virtual reality is not just good for making people look older.
On behalf of Hal and myself, I wish all the best to your present and future selves.
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra.
Also, those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages.
Later when this material was translated into a common European language, which is to say Latin, they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X.
What might explain the difference in the experience of these two nearly identical men?
Now when we do that, we discover some startling things about mental illness from a global perspective.
And yet, even in the best-resourced countries, for example here in Europe, roughly 50 percent of affected people don't receive these interventions.
Soon after my training, I found myself working first in Zimbabwe and then in India, and I was confronted by an altogether new reality.
It was then that I came across these books, and in these books I discovered the idea of task shifting in global health.
It seems to me that there are five key lessons that I've shown on this slide that are critically important for effective task shifting.
It empowers ordinary people to be more effective in caring for the health of others in their community, and in doing so, to become better guardians of their own health. Indeed, for me, task shifting is the ultimate example of the democratization of medical knowledge, and therefore, medical power.
The bad news is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet, so those invoices don't get issued.
Biodiversity, the living fabric of this planet, is not a gas.
What is this about?
That can't keep going on, because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful.
But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice?
A billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein.
It's basically a measure of how many tigers, toads, ticks or whatever on average of biomass of various species are around.
But that doesn't help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place.
Once salt deposition and chemical deposition has had its effects, that answer is more like $12,000 of cost.
This is not illegal stuff, this is basically business as usual, which causes climate-changing emissions, which have an economic cost.
That has to stop.
And the World Bank has acknowledged this and they've started a project called WAVES -- Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services.
A retrospective on 40 years shows that if we had accounted for these costs -- the cost of loss of topsoil, the cost of loss of waterways, the lost productivity, the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors, desertification and so on -- those costs are almost twice as much as the market price of timber.
PUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover, 300 million dollars of profits, 200 million dollars after tax, 94 million dollars of externalities, cost to business.
The other favorite, if you like, solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets.
But that's all about energy and industry.
And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards Indonesia and Brazil to implement this Red Plus scheme.
And the sad thing is that, as these coral reefs are lost -- and scientists tell us that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs -- we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species, the warm water corals, we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans, but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than 500 million people who live in the developing world in poor countries.
I was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence.
He was a philosopher; he was a drum player; he was a teacher par excellence.
It was always fun to be with him.
With these little macho games we would sometimes play -- and he didn't only play them with me, he played them with all sorts of people -- he would almost always win.
The students went there in advance, and they arranged that they would all order Feynman sandwiches.
What Feynman hated worse than anything else was intellectual pretense -- phoniness, false sophistication, jargon.
Well, what do you talk about when you talk about minds?
But it was really brutal.
Dick, he was my friend. I did call him Dick.
But he was convinced of this.
And he said, "Leonardo, were you closer to your mother or to you father when you were a kid?"
And he said he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father.
And to a man -- they were all men -- to a man, every single one of them said, "My mother."
Feynman's scientific style was always to look for the simplest, most elementary solution to a problem that was possible.
And it sort of worked, but it didn't work very well.
The first one was that when helium atoms touch each other, they repel.
Incidentally, I'll tell you what that super-powerful technique was.
You simply take the proton, and you hit it really sharply with an electron.
Feynman said, "Forget all of that.
They don't move, and because they don't move during the course of the experiment, you don't have to worry about how they're moving.
But how should we honor Feynman?
What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces.
The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer.
That's the trailer, pretty much finished.
And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel, and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.
So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology, and there's no money for tooling or molding.
I'm a contract computer scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something called the Tinkering School.
And we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10.
Thing number one -- play with fire.
You don't know what they're going to learn from playing with it.
I first saw this in a Canadian Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives.
So practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it gives a sense -- it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability.
It's a sense of knowability, that something is knowable.
And it's something we often talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things and breaking them open and taking them apart and using them for other things -- and also when we go out and drive a car.
It's very safe actually.
It's not true. I've traveled the whole length and breadth of this country.
Now I can see that's not a very attractive name for legislation: Millions of Children Left Behind. I can see that.
What it doesn't count are all the kids who are in school but being disengaged from it, who don't enjoy it, who don't get any real benefit from it.
Okay. Or grandchildren.
Your mother and I are going to introduce some color-coding system, so we don't get confused."
I just don't believe it's an epidemic like this.
If you can light the spark of curiosity in a child, they will learn without any further assistance, very often.
You know, you're not there just to pass on received information.
He used to talk about the difference between the task and achievement senses of verbs.
But they should not be the dominant culture of education.
Our children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms rather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity.
You know, but it doesn't listen to Radiohead, does it?
Now, we only know that's what they do well at because that's all that's being tested currently.
And they all looked a bit bemused, and said, "Well, we don't have one.
But what all the high-performing systems in the world do is currently what is not evident, sadly, across the systems in America -- I mean, as a whole.
You see, there's a big difference here between going into a mode of command and control in education -- That's what happens in some systems.
It's like education is an industrial process that can be improved just by having better data, and somewhere in, I think, the back of the mind of some policy makers is this idea that if we fine-tune it well enough, if we just get it right, it will all hum along perfectly into the future.
These are programs designed to get kids back into education.
We have to recognize that it's a human system, and there are conditions under which people thrive, and conditions under which they don't.
And in the spring of 2005, there was a phenomenon.
And if you do that, people will rise to it and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate and couldn't have expected.
Thank you very much.
Assuming you live a long life, there's a 50 percent chance you'll develop arthritis.
First thing for my wife, and the most common thing I hear from my patients, particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group, 70-year-old age group, is they come in and say, "Hey, Doc, isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee?
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically.
So my story in working with animal tissues starts in 1984.
What we do is humanize the tissue.
So that's our biologic approach right now.
And so welcome to super biologics.
From a meteorite from space, we're over here with an original Sputnik.
The dawn of books is, of course, important.
We are living at the age here at the end of the book, where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it.
More tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for pictures.
The room is a theatre. It changes colors.
In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination.
It's all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.
But once you've seen them in a new way, you realize that both of these things really are connected.
And we never think about the hidden connection.

I call this hypersonic sound.
Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused.
That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car -- small version, over your head -- so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car.
They tried this back in the '60s and were too smart, and so they gave up.
I have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is: virtually nothing -- and I mean this honestly -- has been invented yet.
For instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie, you get to watch it for free; when you want to hear the sound, you pay.
They have literally beat a path to our door.
The air is not linear, as we've always been taught.
An effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound -- the ultrasound in this case -- that's emitted, but it's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.
That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony, and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden.
We've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into Iraq, where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside.
I have a bunch of other inventions.
I just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash.
You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place.
Thank you once again.
You might ask yourself, what's the usefulness of a robot that's unstable?
It's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [dynamically].
He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.
In a hospital, this device could be used to carry around medical equipment.
your voice so soft and muffled ...
And I'm slowly coming to understand that the appeal of what I do may be connected to why I do it.
and "Does it invoke curiosity?"
And this is for their puzzle special in 2007.
But maybe that's a little too obvious.
And eventually I used this technique to create a piece of artwork.
To say I wonder is to say I question, I ask.
There's an implication that ornamental graphics detract from the seriousness of the content.
But in 2007, I got the cockamamie idea to hand-draw each valentine for everyone on my mailing list.
And those who didn't respond will never receive anything from me ever again.
And I'm just going to read one of them to you.
But I just have to tell you because sometimes I hear your self-doubt, and it's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are, how inspiring and delightful and really, truly the most completely ..."
What is it that's worth spending my time on and my life on in this way?
And it's very, very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we're not contributing enough, or worse, that all we're doing is contributing to landfill.
And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this Earth in this way.
Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure, but they're formed at the nanoscale.
Same with diatoms, which are shown right here, which are glasseous structures.
Also, when we think about future technologies, we start with the beginning of Earth.
What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV?
And they can pull calcium out of the environment, put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.
And I know it says MIT, and this is Caltech, but I have a couple extra if people want it.
So basically what I didn't tell you is that about 500 million years ago, organisms starter making materials, but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it.
And you could basically do this a billion times.
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes.
But it's basically -- you can pull one out of a billion.
These are virus-assembled nanowires.
So this is a virus-based solar cell.
And so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work.
Typically you get three different kinds of answers.
You almost never hear someone say the office.
Then you have something else to do.
I did these conference calls. I did all this stuff.
Six? Five? Four?
I'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phased-based, or stage-based, events.
It just takes a while. You've got to go through these phases and stuff, and if you're interrupted, you don't sleep well.
They'll also say -- sometimes they'll also say, "Well, if I can't see the person, how do I know they're working?"
Because those are voluntary distractions.
You can't go to a website at work, and that's the problem, that's why people aren't getting work done, because they're going to Facebook and they're going to Twitter?
You find a lot of other distractions, but you don't find managers and meetings.
But what's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all, which is call meetings.
What if they're doing important work?
If there are 10 people in the meeting, it's a 10-hour meeting; it's not a one-hour meeting.
So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation.
How about -- pick one Thursday once a month and cut that day in half and just say the afternoon -- I'll make it really easy for you.
Giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable.
You can put these things away, and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule, at your own time, when you're available, when you're ready to go again.
And you'll find out that everything will be just fine.
And I specialize in human behavioral research, and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways, and to design for that future.
And that's, kind of, where I see what my job is and what our team's job is.
So I've probably done about five years' research looking at what people carry.
I mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to.
If you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
And the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal -- and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it's convenient.
And that's that moment when you're walking out of a space, and you turn around, and quite often you tap your pockets.
OK, so when we did this research, we found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed way to never forget anything ever, ever again.
So, let me give you an example of delegation in practice, right.
And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.
I'm sending money back, and it works like this.
So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone -- anyone who has a mobile phone -- essentially into an ATM machine.
And OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier.
They also write them in Hindi.
And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes.
And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural Uganda.
You can see the chai being poured in the background.
And I know TED is about big ideas, but actually, the benchmark for a big idea is changing.
And if we're smart, we'll look at this stuff that's going on, and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design.
We're seeing, along with that proliferation of mobile devices, an expectation of availability.
"The stretch."
That is actually the device.
This is the sound of one hand clapping.
Another is to change our lifestyles.
What were we just talking about?
We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and, by extension, breast cancer, simply by making these changes.
And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed -- in effect, turning on the good genes, the disease-preventing genes, turning off the disease-promoting genes.
And then three years later -- which in fairness, kind of is forever by Hollywood standards -- they broke up, and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done.
And then I went home that night, and I had an even larger emotional meltdown, which I'll say more about in a minute.
This idea is nicely captured by this quote: "Things without all remedy should be without regard; what's done is done."
It's called a lobotomy.
And in fact, the more we have of either of these things -- the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret, the more acute that regret will be.
Now within that framework, we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things.
We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have.
But for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around, what does that experience feel like?
I mean, it's right up there with, "I want my mommy!"
We don't understand that part.
So if you look at the psychological literature, these are the four consistent defining components of regret.
We're incredibly used to not having to face life's hard realities, in a certain sense.
And the amazing thing about this really insidious technological innovation is that even just with this one thing, we can experience a huge range of regret.
I want to suggest that there's three things that help us to make our peace with regret.
But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion when it comes to these more profound regrets.
Because it's actually not that hideous.
Some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are.
And ironically, I think it's probably the single most important thing I possibly could have tattooed onto my body -- partly as a writer, but also just as a human being.
We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent, but insufficient in three major ways.
When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren I hope to have, it is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities -- locally, nationally and globally -- that share the characteristics of all successful communities: a broadly shared, accessible set of opportunities, a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise and a genuine sense of belonging.
30 percent of our households gave.
When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation, and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on.
So the very first week we were working, we got the price down to 500 dollars.
We negotiated it down to 190.
And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden, is a mystery to me.
Now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish.
And two, will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to 10 years?
So when we decided to work in Rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem, we wanted to build a healthcare network, because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994, and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day.
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country, and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it.
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it.
Listen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment.
Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated along with four other clinics, complete with solar power generators, good lab technology.
My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build a high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda, that can be a model for Africa, and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world.
I am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end.
It was a fairy tale, and then we retired.
We had had a wonderful life there, and we decided to do something unusual.
And for me it's just the idea that, if this little girl graduates as a whole person, chances are she'll demand a whole world -- a whole world -- to live on.
These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree.
We're on the grid. We're not proud of it.
These are compost toilets, and nobody at the school wanted to know about them, especially the principal.
There's an amazing river traveling through it, and you can see there how we manage to get across the river.
And people are bringing their green industries, hopefully their green restaurants, to the Green School.
This is the school buffalo.
And the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field.
And it's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world.
The kids love it.
And together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global, green leaders.
It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this.
We had them engineered by the engineers.
Green School is a model we built for the world.
For most of my life, I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak.
So I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends to read my words aloud for me.
Two weeks later, I was ready to return home.
A doctor from Brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture.
This was faster, and nobody had to try to read my handwriting.
People don't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase.
So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of 30 years.
So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice, including several audio commentary tracks that I'd made for movies on DVDs.
Roger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is to be back on your show.
It makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on "Casablanca" and "Citizen Kane."
The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice, and I'm optimistic about it.
For almost all of its millions and billions of years, there was no life on Earth at all.
As a local newspaper reporter still in high school, I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois to interview the creators of something called PLATO.
Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana, it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today.
"The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the Porteram Telebubble.
We are born into a box of time and space.
But online, everybody speaks at the same speed.
People -- People talk loudly -- I'm so sorry.
That's why writing on the Internet has become a lifesaver for me.
I have much to make me happy and relieved.
The psychiatrist says, "You're crazy."
Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news, and advertisers follow them.
Sounds nice, but this can only buy time.
I said, "I'm designing newspapers."
My approach was very egotistic.
The secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece, as one composition -- like music.
Isn't amazing?
And the process we made was not about changing the look, it was about improving the product completely.
So what is the lesson behind it?
You can have no budgets, no people -- but still can put your work to the highest possible level.
So every year, June 16, we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died.
And she said to them, "Vusi's here, and you're not going to take him tonight.
I had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever.
I ended up with blunt chest trauma.
I was wrapped in ice and then eventually put into a drug-induced coma.
I had lots of titanium put in me, cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way.
So they basically put a map up on the wall, threw a dart, and it landed at a senior home here in Colorado.
I was wearing hospital scrubs.
So I had to go through trying to eat again.
So eventually what went on is they decided that, well I need to learn to speak.
So they were teaching me cuss word Scrabble at night, and then, secretly, how to swear like a sailor.
You don't know how far that street is and you don't know if you're going straight and you hear cars whizzing back and forth, and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation.
And I was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me, and also the guide dog and skill set I had gained.
So I was walking around it.
But the concept held true -- people working with people to rebuild me; people working with people to re-educate me.
And the last words he said to his brother were, "Don't cry for me, Alfred.
And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny, he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation.
And it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well.
To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles we might see there, it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape in a higher dimensional space.
But what artists like to do is to set up expectations of symmetry and then break them.
Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting, and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth."
You see it already. Immediately you go in, the reflective symmetry in the water.
For Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann, which was something still and deathly -- for Galois, symmetry was all about motion.
But it's also about producing a language to describe this.
And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before I started.
And this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical -- so everything has symmetry, where you just leave it where it is.
So here is a little question for you.
If I do one magic trick move followed by another, the combination is a third magic trick move.
What I if I did it in the other order? Would it make any difference?
Now, let's do it in a different order.
Now, Galois produced some laws for how these tables -- how symmetries interact.
And we can see this now: we go back to the walls in the Alhambra.
So rotate along halfway along the edge, and they all match up.
They all look very different. But this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object, which we call 4-4-2. Nothing to do with football, but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn.
So, like Galois, I stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you, and I've got a picture of it here.
In order to win this symmetrical object, what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning.
Great. Excellent. That should get us going. All right.
If I told you 20 or less, stand up.
So, what is your name?
Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting, and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth." Thank you.
Now let's advance to 10,000 years before the present.
The skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning, noon and night.
But I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal, there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have.
More recently, Harvey Cushing, who really developed neurosurgery as we know it, who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a hopeful outlook, he was very conscious that he was not always going to do the right thing.
This consciousness, though, was a little slow to seep through the general population, even people who were very, very well informed.
Now there is something else, though, in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated.
It saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies.
In the Second World War, too, the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain.
What happened was the bactericide was formulated with minute traces of tin.
They have combined the list of major innovations, and they've discovered that the greatest number, the greatest decade, for fundamental innovations, as reflected in all of the lists that others have made -- a number of lists that they have merged -- was the Great Depression.
It means, I think, that we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities.
We need to take a really positive view.
The message, then, for me, about unintended consequences is chaos happens; let's make better use of it.
So today I'm going to tell you 10 things that you thought everybody knew, but it turns out they don't.
But what about the pop-up menu where you put in your state?
When you're typing on your Blackberry, Android, iPhone, don't bother switching layouts to the punctuation layout to hit the period and then a space and then try to capitalize the next letter.
So it turns out there's a keyboard shortcut that lets you jump directly to the beep like this.
Type the name of the airline and the flight.
Also, don't delete what you've highlighted.
I've just turned your $50 camera into a $1,000 camera with that trick.
Hit me.
So I kind of have a -- this is BumpTop.
Also some of the stuff we can do is, for these individual icons we thought -- I mean, how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further?
Also just like paper, around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later, and I can do the same thing here, and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices.
I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable -- and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it.
The violin, which meant everything to me, became a grave burden on me.
My audience is anyone who is here to listen, even those who are not familiar with classical music.
I really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you, TEDsters.
And similar topography.
And he said, "Well we were mostly breaking stealth."
So we didn't use a radar; we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals, electronic communication.
And I said, "How does that work?"
And the magic and the horror of that is that the same math that you use to break up the big thing into a million little things can be used to find a million little things and sew them back together and figure out what's actually happening in the market.
And that's the thing, is that we're writing things, we're writing these things that we can no longer read.
You can find it here: this book about flies that you may have been looking at on Amazon.
And so Netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years.
Wouldn't that be handy?
And they're in your house. They're in your house.
So none of this mishegas of letting everybody go into whatever car they want.
We're designing for this machine dialect.
And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system.
This is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal 37 times faster than you can click a mouse -- just for these algorithms, just for the Carnival and the Knife.
So that's what we'll do: we'll build bubbles or something, or platforms.
Thank you.
This much, right?
Audience: Fold.
Audience: Shake.
JS: Now, there's now a real fancy invention, it's the one where you wave your hand and it kicks it out.
You will for the rest of your life remember those words every time you pick up a paper towel.
Roundabouts are much better.
They're expensive to install, but they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that.
That's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day, that's $51,000 per year.
So, it makes one wonder, "Why is it there?"
Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.
And uncertainty results in caution.
Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay, and it was the imperfections that people cherished.
When I sat down to write a book about creativity, I realized that the steps were reversed.
We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me, that led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually, was traveling folk theater that would come through the town and I would go off and see these great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of, you know, passion, and hashish as well, and it was amazing.
JB: It's so powerful. Richard Ford, who's won the Pulitzer Prize, says that dyslexia helped him write sentences.
Richard Serra: I was standing there looking at it, and I realized that Velázquez was looking at me, and I thought, "Oh. I'm the subject of the painting."
It's the embrace of loss, the oldest and most constant of human experiences.
And it was such a blow that it woke me up, in the way that it was meant to be, I guess.
Looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when I went home to my family at night.
JB: You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency, of the need to get to work, is so powerful in Joel's story.
Thank you.
And with my short time today, I just want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible for that redefinition.
"It was awesome.
First day away from home, and already she's taking candy from a stranger?!'" And she said, "Everybody lost it. Twenty feet in every direction, everyone started to howl.
And that was such an eye-opening, transformative moment for me to think that maybe the biggest impact I'd ever had on anyone's life, a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say, "You've been an incredibly important person in my life," was a moment that I didn't even remember.
Marianne Williamson said, "Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate.
And it's a simple idea, but I don't think it's a small one, and I want to thank you all so much for letting me share it with you today.
We need to shine light to see what we're doing.
And because we no longer need to use sunlight, we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room.
Well if cancer can be caught early, enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out, excised with surgery, I don't care if it has this gene or that gene, or if it has this protein or that protein, it's in the jar.
The nurses, anesthesiologist, the surgeon, all the assistants are waiting around.
We think the entire tumor is out."
The main part of it is the blue part, polycation, and it's basically very sticky to every tissue in your body.
The molecule passes through and gets excreted.
We can tell in the operating room, in the field, at a molecular level, where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out.
That you can, not only see the margins right there on a molecular level, but you can see it even if it's not right on the top -- even if it's beyond your field of view.
It doesn't tell you whether or not the gas station has gas.
Who amongst us hasn't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold?
And what I'm talking about are nerves.
So I said, wouldn't it be great if we could find a way to see nerves with fluorescence?
And we eventually discovered molecules that were specifically labeling nerves.
So here's a tumor.
This was a bit of a breakthrough.
The eventual goal is that we'll get this into patients.
It is not an event for the solo runner.
Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems.
We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated, where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable, but they made them operable for our study.
And the first things that you can see from this graph is, if you look at the blue data points, which are the mechanically ventilated air, they're not simply a subset of the green data points, which are the outdoor air.
And the model that we're working with in hospitals, and also with many, many different buildings, is to keep the outdoors out.
You woke up, felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door, encountered new colleagues and had great discussions, and felt in awe when you found something new.
There's a class of cells, a fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell, that quiets its neighbors.
They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs, which then, if they pass a certain threshold, will go to thousands of downstream partners.
Already, a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them, and the numbers don't do it justice though.
But electricity also will go in all directions -- the path of least resistance, which is where that phrase, in part, comes from.
You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells.
In its membrane, or its boundary, it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity.
And early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004, we gave it a try, and it worked on the first try.
And then when you shine light on the entire network, just that cell type will be activated.
And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction.
Now we can generalize the idea.
And over time -- in this case, a mouse, which is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone.
This tone used to mean bad news.
And we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life -- every kingdom of life except for animals, we see slightly differently.
And so we don't have data to show you on this front, but we're very excited about this.
Most of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains, so what is our brain going to do if we put that in?
In many forms of blindness, like retinitis pigmentosa, or macular degeneration, the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed.
And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze.
We're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide.
And our hope is that, by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them, we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier, practically none of which are cured, and in the 21st century make them history.
And by turning things off, it's more or less a zero.
I want to take you back basically to my hometown, and to a picture of my hometown of the week that "Emergence" came out.
If they hadn't been crowded -- you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers, and you can see that very powerfully.
I walked up along Hudson Street -- where Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what I was writing in "Emergence" -- past the White Horse Tavern, that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death, and the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids.
They don't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail.
Who decides that Soho should have this personality and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality?
I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that's starting to emerge online right now.
The new model is much more like this, and we've already seen a couple of references to this.
Now, they're more innovative -- well, Google's pretty innovative -- but there are some new twists on this.
So when I was talking in "Emergence," I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture that, basically, you could link to somebody else but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them.
I wouldn't really be directly in control of it.
That's not necessarily something we didn't know already.
And it turns out, actually, that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish.
So Gary Bauer is not too far behind -- has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection.
They're talking about slavery in 1860.
I'll go very quickly.
It's not being imposed by fiat from above.
So in a sense, bursty weblogs coming from new voices.
From mother to daughter, preacher to congregant, teacher to pupil, storyteller to audience.
We are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation, not story, is king.
In the first nine months we ran 25 clubs across the U.K., with kids in age groups between five and 18 watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes.
I had seen the film on the occasion of my father's 50th birthday.
It shows how to do right, how to be heroically awkward.
"Pickpocket" started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement.
The films provided communality across all manner of divide.
And they themselves had not known they cared.
After two years in hiding, my grandfather appeared in London.
As one 12-year-old said after watching "Wizard of Oz," "Every person should watch this, because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart."
Once-reluctant students now race to school, talk to their teachers, fight, not on the playground, but to choose next week's film -- young people who have found self-definition, ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed.
So yesterday, I was out in the street in front of this building, and I was walking down the sidewalk, and I had company, several of us, and we were all abiding by the rules of walking down sidewalks.
Now, working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day.
It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie, or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room.
You up for that? Okay.
Just shout it out.
Some people can hang on to 10.
Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate.
We tend to remember about four things.
You ever forgotten your kids?
We need to process what's going on the moment it happens, not 10 minutes later, not a week later, at the moment.
We're going to write it down, and when you get home, pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time.
Think about things in images, write things down that way.
We all started as novices.
And the question was, were the birds singing?
Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called "The Monticello Dialogues" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note -- "We realize that design is a signal of intention, but it also has to occur within a world, and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence, and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs in which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet, and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there, because the news is the news of abundance, and not the news of limits, and I think as our culture tortures itself now with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear, we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent, driven by the sun, and start to imagine what that would be like to share."
So the question is, what is the first question for designers?
And I was at the White House for President Bush, meeting with every federal department and agency, and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan.
And so we call it "cradle to cradle," and our goal is very simple.
This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition instead of Alzheimer's later in life.
And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC, they asked him, "When will we see the end of the age of oil?"
We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings -- bismuth, antimony, copper and so on.
And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been farming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries.
I guess he didn't read Vitruvius.
It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists, and they found six times as much plastic as plankton.
So, we're looking at the same criteria as most people -- you know, can I afford it?
So we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together.
Then, the question becomes not growth or no growth, but what do you want to grow?
Using those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.] We were left with 38 chemicals.
Here's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet.
It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn.
The country -- the home of biological. And putting them together.
We're building a new city next to this city; look at that landscape.
We studied the biota, the ancient biota, the current farming and the protocols.
Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas?
We inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors.
And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist.
This is five times larger.
And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner.
They're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent.
But now we do.
This is what they have been told to do: do signals intelligence, monitor telecommunications, monitor Internet traffic.
And every single one of these companies denies.
And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well.
And then there's the argument that okay, yes, this might be going on, but then again, other countries are doing it as well.
And then we turn it around.
Today, it no longer is secure.
Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists?
I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.
It should be built in to all the systems we use.
And let me actually quote the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff.
So, what is there to be done?
Maybe you can do it together with other countries.
So let's take a look at the brain.
There's the cerebellum; that's keeping you upright right now.
It's cells and it's wires all wired together.
They're probably less cell dense.
These are support cells -- astrocytes glia.
And they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do.
So we sent our lab technician out.
Because what we're trying to measure, the RNA -- which is the readout from our genes -- is very labile, and so we have to move very quickly.
The next thing we do is we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging.
So this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments.
This will then go onto a robot that's going to apply one of those stains to it.
They scribe along a place there.
And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it, we get a unique fingerprint, if you will, quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample.
We've put all of that together into one thing, and I'll show you what that synthesis looks like.
Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on.
Genes send the instructions to make proteins.
And we get confirmation.
But what you get out of such an exercise is simply a list of genes.
And what we're finding is actually, even at the brain biochemical level, we are quite similar.
One is called RELN -- it's involved in early developmental cues.
They give researchers a handle on where to go.
Maybe a sobering thought and something you all know about.
Do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money?
And the reason is that -- take Africa for example.
To give the aid, and hope and pray that something comes out of it?
And the world has spent a lot of money on it: The GAVI and the Gates Foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it, and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort.
Bed nets are very cheap.
So, what do you do?
So here is the thing.
So I start with immunization.
After all, in this country as well, all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization.
So these are simple ideas, but we didn't know.
Now, a kilo of lentils is tiny.
Add the lentils and you reach to 38 percent.
So the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions.
And many experiments have been run, and they all have the same results, so I'm just going to talk to you about one.
Well, the good news is, people, if they have the bed nets, will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it.
You know how to immunize kids, you know how to give bed nets."
Consider for example transporting goods.
How many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars?
And for every hundred dollars, you get almost 30 extra years of education.
That doesn't sound like that much when you think about it.
You cannot helicopter people out of poverty.
Deworming.
It's a very slow process.
I believe we can and I hope we will.
What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa?
Slavery.
And turnarounds are part and parcel of what I have focused on for most of my professional career.
But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle.
But very soon, I found myself from the southern part of Africa, in South Africa -- at the very north, in Egypt.
Now, the thing I remember about Siwa was the magical view of the sky at night.
And then I saw it -- Africa. Quite literally the "Dark Continent."
In fact -- coming back to the land mass -- Africa is so big that you could fit in the continental United States, China, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space.
So let's start looking at some of those.
It's made up -- It's made up of 53 different countries.
And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in.
Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon, a large retailer, is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy.
Is anyone -- our banks, our investors -- seriously thinking about going to Nigeria?
Looking at the oil industry, Africa provides 18 percent of the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent.
So let's unpack those very quickly, and I'm going to move through these very, very, very fast because I can see that clock counting down.
In Tanzania last week, we had the launch of the East African Organic Produce Standard.
The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation, from over 80 banks to 25 banks. Strengthening of the system.
Nigeria: 70 percent of roads are untarred. Zambia: 80 percent.
South Africa: in the 20 percents. High ones.
Today, 16 African countries and growing have sovereign country ratings. What does this mean?
They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen.
That is a transformation in power of ideas.
I've been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously, non-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 30 years, and to see them move is a dance I'll never get tired of.
It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard. And "God"?
You think this is just another day in your life?
We just think of the weather, and even with the weather, we don't think of all the many nuances of weather.
You flip a switch and there is electric light.
It changes what we see. It changes what we remember.
And what I discovered is, what I should do is not actually replicate what they saw, is replicate what they remembered.
So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can, and I'm basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw in front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you, what you were reacting to, what you're emoting to, is something that's a total falsehood, and I found that really kind of fascinating.
So I showed him these two shots, and then he basically told me what he thought.
And then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for.
And he said, "Huh, that's pretty good. Can we use it?"
I automatically wanted to see this ship, this magnificent ship, basically in all its glory, and conversely, I wanted to see it not in all its glory, basically go back to what it looks like.
So basically, if there's two subs in the same shot, I shot it, because where's the camera coming from?
And so I'll just show it one more time.
So this is the shot. That's a little video of what you're looking at there, which is our little test, so that's actually what you're seeing, and I thought it was sort of an interesting thing, because it was, part of the homage of the movie itself is coming up with this sort of genius trick which I can't take credit for.
And we felt that if we could basically move the camera with him, we would feel what it feels like to be this boy who is basically the master of his universe, and his universe is, you know, behind the scenes in the bowels of this particular train station that only he can actually navigate through and do it this way, and we had to make it feel that this is his normal, everyday sort of life, so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important, and of course, in shooting in 3D, which is basically it's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick, so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task, and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got when you saw the "Goodfellas" shot.
So, all I can say is, thank you, and that's my presentation for you.
Now, follow my actions exactly.
Now, I remember when I was about 15, I read a copy of Life magazine, which detailed a story about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman who could sense printed letters -- there's still people trying to do it here -- -- who could sense printed letters and even sense colors, just by touch.
So, let's take a look.
KT: Yes.
KT: No.
KB: Look at the road, look at the road.
KB: Where are we? Where are we?
We're nearly there. Oh, my God!
So, do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes?
This is because magic is all about directing attention.
OK, give them a round of applause as they come up.
Is it a girl?
Come in a little bit closer.
OK, now, I want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you, because we're going to try a voodoo experiment right now.
KB: Twice. OK, extend your left arm out in front of you.
KB: Can you show us where?
Sit right here.
That's it, all the way down, all the way down, all the way down, and further, and further, and further, and further, and further and further.
Yes.
Imagine a connection between you and him.
Only when you want the pressure to go back, make a downward gesture.
OK, you can go back.
You see, psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes.
And you can whack it against the table, if you want.
I want you to imagine, right now, a broken relationship from many years ago.
Now, imagine all that negative energy in there.
You didn't react to that, so it's four letters in the title.
Thank you.
KB: OK, Steve, I want you to take a seat, right behind here. Excellent.
Happy?
KB: Almost, oh. OK, you're making sure that's well hidden. Now -- oh, we've got one here, we've got one here.
Now, is there any way to see through this blindfold?
Give them an extra mix up.
KB: OK, where are you? Put out your hand.
SJ: I don't think it's there.
KB: There?
SJ: Uh, neither.
KB: Thank you.
You know who you are.
So how did it start?
So I took to my bed for about a month, and when I woke up I found I was institutionalized, and when I saw the other inmates, I realized that I had found my people, my tribe.
If you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally, its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow, so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic.
This little baby has a lot of horsepower.
Can you imagine, every human being is carrying that equipment, even Paris Hilton?
Thank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol, and then we'd kill or be killed, we'd eat or we'd be eaten, and then suddenly we'd de-fuel, and we'd go back to normal. Okay.
But my point is, if we don't talk about this stuff, and we don't learn how to deal with our lives, it's not going to be one in four. It's going to be four in four who are really, really going to get ill in the upstairs department.
And I personally am obsessed with morality.
Would you like to see it? I brought some with me.
It is," he said, "only a female molecule.
Baseline levels are near zero, without some stimulus to cause its release.
Why? I had shown in the early 2000s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous.
Let me show you how we do that.
You're going to make them a lot wealthier.
So in fact, experimental economists had run this test around the world, and for much higher stakes, and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust, and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness.
Two things.
So oxytocin is the trust molecule, but is it the moral molecule?
What does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin?
In this book, Smith argued that we are moral creatures, not because of a top-down reason, but for a bottom-up reason.
But knowing that molecule is valuable, because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off.
"I don't know, put it in the lost and found."
I'll be there and I'll give him a $200 reward."
I'll give you the jewelry, you give me a hundred dollars, and when the guy comes ... " You see it. I was conned.
So there's a technical word for these people in my lab.
So we all know this, when we're really stressed out, we're not acting our best.
We don't need God or government telling us what to do.
And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes.
Her mother was number two.
Many people are Tweeting right now.
He was interacting on his girlfriend's Facebook page.
And it's so easy to cause people's brains to release oxytocin.
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day.
But the Victorians actually did it.
They must know three things: They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten; they must be able to read; and they must be able to do multiplication, division, addition and subtraction in their head.
It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.
In fact, they need to be able to read discerningly.
At the same time, we also had lots of parents, rich people, who had computers, and who used to tell me, "You know, my son, I think he's gifted, because he does wonderful things with computers.
I said, "Just like that."
I repeated the experiment there.
On your right is an eight-year-old.
But I was curious to know, what else would they do if they could do this much?
Where does it stop?
The children came rushing, said, "What's all this?"
So I said, "Okay, but how long did it take you before you decided that you can't understand anything?"
How do I get them to pass? I have to get them 20 more marks.
What's the next page? Gosh, when I was your age, I could have never done that.' You know what grannies do."
So what are jobs going to be like?
But look at it this way.
Punishment and examinations are seen as threats.
We need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure.
I've seen them do it from a village called Diggles in northwestern England, deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu, India, 6,000 miles away.
Grandmother: Well done! Very good.
Well, I intend to build these Self-Organized Learning Environments.
Girl: The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons -- SM: Australia Girl: -- giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge.
The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say, "If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth, how would you figure out if it was going to or not?"
My wish is that we design the future of learning.
It's a facility which is practically unmanned.
And just one last thing.
I'll follow her advice. I'll stop talking.
Well, what I'm doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand.
And ... Well, I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin.
It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -- what Michael was doing -- because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you're playing with and stay in tune, and at the same time you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time; you want to be feeling the music.
I think we will play another tune now.
There are several instances in Uttar Pradesh of people dying before their case is given a proper review.
The subjects I documented ranged from feuding families in Brazil to victims of genocide in Bosnia to the first woman to hijack an airplane and the living dead in India.
And this disorder is in direct contrast to the unalterable order of a bloodline.
Through my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem, I wanted to look at the early paperwork of the establishment of the Jewish state.
In his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here.
They include dengue fever, imprisonment, army service, women not allowed to be photographed for religious and cultural reasons.
Haigh's Chocolate, in collaboration with the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia, stopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate and has replaced it with the Easter Bilby.
She is followed by her four children, all of whom were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.
I solicited China's State Council Information Office in 2009 to select a multi-generational bloodline to represent China for this project.
And I also photographed the gift bag they gave me when I left.
Again, talking about fate, I was interested in the stories and fate of particular works of art.
But it got violent in the last two decades and includes decapitation and the death of two mayors.
This piece is ordered by age because it can't be ordered by blood.
And the director listed the orphanage's most urgent needs as an industrial size washing machine and dryer, four vacuum cleaners, two computers, a video projector, a copy machine, winter shoes and a dentist's drill.
And there's this relentless persistence of birth and death and an unending collection of stories in between.
And it sounds quite simple, but actually it's quite a big, big job.
I'm being told where to play on the drum.
But it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting, and that you want to explore through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.
However, that is simply not enough.
So in the same way that I need time with this instrument, I need time with people in order to interpret them.
He said, "Well, I think I hear it through here."
They're all different.
And every single entry had to be listened to, experienced and then based on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not.
If there were no resonators on here, we would have ...
Whatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening.
May be great there, but terrible up there.
It may be that they can walk three, four, five steps. That, to them, means they can walk.
And you know, it's just one of the great things about being a musician, is that it is so unbelievably fluid.
Evelyn Glennie: Well then, stop clapping. Try again.
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands.
I had to basically look at this particular drum, see how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did.
Single stroke rolls. So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music?
Is it just literally for control, for hand-stick control? Why am I doing that?
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound, because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum, or the mallet on the bit of wood, or the bow on the string, etc., or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass.
"Star Fox 20"?
And we've gone from one board to 48 boards.
And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth these past two years ...
And so there are three that I want to show you specifically.
And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago, and that was the Time 100 poll.
It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list; they were actually -- it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top 21 places to spell "mARBLECAKE. ALSO, THE GAME."
And last, I'm going to show you the example, the story of Dusty the cat.
As I said, it's raw, it's unfiltered.
But if I ask them, is the TED website going to go down?
I mean, for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment, there is plenty of bad.
CP: There are, certainly.
CP: Cats and dogs were mentioned too.
What's the commercial picture here?
But what conversations did you or do you have with your mother about 4chan?
Chris, thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED.
I mean, certainly mammals did. This is one example.
Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace, an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it.
They became marine. We now know them today from the ice caps.
I'd like to call for this little video clip to give you some idea of, sort of, what we face. Normally, we get asked a lot of questions: "Well, how do you find fossils in areas that look like this?"
228 million years old, we found what really is the most primitive dinosaur: that's the Ur-dinosaur.
We are extremely dinosaur-like, and unusual in our two-legged approach to life.
Some of them -- the most important -- are mental.
So, you can't leave your normal metal tools out because you'll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes.
That's a 2,000 mile journey.
When you pick up a piece of history like that, I think it can transform kids that are possibly interested in science.
It has no big claw on its hind foot. It doesn't look like a Velociraptor.
We had to actually look at recent crocodiles to understand how crocodiles scale.
Watch out! Watch out! No, no, no, no. You're going to have to get on the back legs.
Big, but less than half the size of supercroc's skull.
Whoa!
An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara 5,000 years ago is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back. So, really exciting.
We need to delve into this mass of anatomy that we've been compiling to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means.
But when they were divided, indeed they were divided, and we do see the continents carving differences among dinosaurs.
Now we have divergence over time, but we've created the third dimension of area.
I was a total failure in school, not really headed to graduate high school.
But really it's the same discipline -- they're kindred disciplines.
And a more general question for our society is, what's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind?
And the question is -- and we started to address this question for centuries -- as to how we get these kids involved in science.
It's gone through science as an inquiry, which was a big advance, and Dewey back at Chicago -- you learn by doing.
Running -- it's basically just right, left, right, left -- yeah?
That's her competition.
Instead of taking off, she falls back, and she grabs Paula Radcliffe, says, "Come on. Come with us. You can do it."
It's a heartwarming story, but if you drill a little bit deeper, you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there.
The Mayans and Aztecs engaged, which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs.
Well, there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the Tarahumara have known forever.
The only problem is, the first edged weapons only appeared about 200,000 years ago.
There's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been.
Now I've been to a lot of marathons, and I've yet to see any ...
So why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer?
So you have these three mysteries.
But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that, when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances, we're superb, we're the best on the planet.
If you go out by yourself, and you try to chase an antelope, I guarantee you there's going to be two cadavers out there in the Savannah.
You need to have those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill, and you need to have those teenagers there who are learning the whole thing all involved.
You know, we look at running as this kind of alien, foreign thing, this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before.
You talk to a runner, I guarantee, within 30 seconds, the conversation turns to injury.
Humans ran and ran all the time.
So what's the benefit? So what?
And what they have found uniformly is you get rid of the shoes, you get rid of the stress, you get rid of the injuries and the ailments.
So 20 years pass -- I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence, the year is 1997, and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars.
Kismet: Scientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me.
And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo.
Cookie Monster is very, very bad.
It turns out it's the same for robots.
He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with.
The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants.
We looked at their desire to cooperate.
We try Skype, we try phone calls, but my boys are little -- they don't really want to talk; they want to play.
But if robots can be engaging, if we like to cooperate with robots, if robots are persuasive, maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program, maybe they can help you manage your weight.
You'd use a screen interface to enter information, like how many calories you ate that day, how much exercise you got.
Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface, ran exactly the same dialogues.
And when you look at emotional engagement, it was completely different.
And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Playtime Computing that's really trying to think about how we can take what's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child, where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play.
So changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world.
I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own.
And so whether they're helping us to become creative and innovative, or whether they're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance, or whether they are our trusted sidekick who's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves, for me, robots are all about people.
When I'm wearing fresh gear I don't have to hide, and I really must get some new gear soon or my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon.
I'm ready and willing. I'm packing my gun.
He made a left turn on Houston, I pulled out my gun, and I said, 'Gimme them Jordans!' And the punk tried to run.
Thank you.
You know what the problem is with you, homie?
I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea because he told me it was brain food.
I've traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex in East New York, took the local 6 line up to the hookers of Hunt's Point who were in my way on my way to master the art of space, and the one-to-infinite amount of man, woman and child you can fit in there only so I can push them to the back of the wall with my experience.
So what, your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep?
I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago, when Princess Diana died.
Was she in love with him?
This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance, but you think it's Camilla and the Queen, and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real.
And then I was sort of making imagery.
Suddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable, which I found also fascinating.
I was exploring, at the time, the hyperbole of icons -- and Diana and Marilyn -- and the importance of celebrity in our lives.
Then I made a book.
And also dealing with the perceptions that are put about Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, the links that were put about pre-Iraq war.
But it was a difficulty for me -- because this is my artwork; should I do advertising? -- at the time.
I then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them, so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes -- live scenes with look-alikes inside the windows, and the windows were all steamed up.
It's an extremely fast way of getting information.
What Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life, and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage and golf-clubbed a driver the other day.
Thank you.
So the design of cities is a key issue for our future.
The design of a street can tell you everything about what's expected on it.
So we worked hard to change that balance, and probably the best example of our new approach is in Times Square.
And I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know.
And this is an important lesson, because it doesn't need to be a zero-sum game between moving traffic and creating public space.
And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town.
This is in front of Macy's, and they were a big supporter of this new approach, because they understood that more people on foot is better for business.
And the proof is not in a computer model.
We also brought this quick-acting approach to our cycling program, and in six years turned cycling into a real transportation option in New York.
We protected bikers by floating parking lanes, and it's been great.
Not everybody liked the new bike lanes, and there was a lawsuit and somewhat of a media frenzy a couple years ago.
That's 280 times around the globe.
And today, cyclists look like New York City looks.
I think one of my very favorite moments as transportation commissioner was the day that we launched Citi Bike, and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue in my protected bike lane, and I looked over and I saw pedestrians standing safely on the pedestrian islands, and the traffic was flowing, birds were singing -- -- the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes.
In Africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored.
All friends of Africa, that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time, should be very concerned about this deplorable situation.
And those are the times they're most productive.
Only less than one percent are adequately treated.
Here is the situation: countries are turning inwards.
Several years ago, we started thinking about it.
That is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here, if you want to help Africa, invest money in sustainable development.
We make sure that we select our equipment properly.
We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology.
And we will do other centers.
They'll give me that information, and we'll make the care of the patient better.
And everyone will get the care they deserve.
Which group loses the most weight, we give them prizes.
By the end of this year, we would have contributed over one million dollars in indigent care. In the first four months, it's been 340,000 dollars, averaging 85,000 dollars a month. The government will not do that, because they have competing needs.
And we are starting a biomedical engineering program, so that we will train people locally, who can repair that equipment.
Sharon Lazarus: I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean, since the past two years. I received training at this institution.
Africa has been good to us; it is time for us to give back to Africa.
I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today.
Well, if you're building a bridge, details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignore the details.
people weren't noticing these things -- a chain hanging down -- and that's shown very, very nicely in the movie.
And I was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different. Like if I say, "Think about a church steeple" most people get this sort of generalized generic one.
And they come up one at a time, and then I think, "OK, well maybe we can have it snow, or we can have a thunderstorm," and I can hold it there and turn them into videos.
But one of the things that really worries me is: Where's the younger version of those kids going today?
And my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the control's.
More abstract. These are your engineers, your computer programmers.
I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face.
There's a ton of information on that fire hydrant.
You see, it's a different picture.
Or is the whole design of the system wrong?
You know, now as I think about that, I'm pulling up all of that specific information.
And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher.
The thing is, you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind, or your mind can be wired to be more social.
And the Wolfram stuff -- I was taking notes and I was writing down all the search words I could use, because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures.
I was taught that when I was eight years old.
Let's get him working on building different things.
The pattern thinkers, they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians, your software engineers, your computer programmers, all of those kinds of jobs.
We need to be doing that.
And if you bring them in for internships in your companies, the thing about the autism, Asperger-y kind of mind, you've got to give them a specific task. Don't just say, "Design new software."
You know, you once wrote, I like this quote, "If by some magic, autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth, then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave."
But then you get the smart, geeky kids that have a touch of autism, and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things.
When I have a mother of an autistic child say, "My kid went to college because of your book, or one of your lectures," that makes me happy.
TG: Well the reason why I got really excited when I read about that, it contains knowledge.
While scientists regularly publish their latest research, we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.
And I'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life.
Give it another try.
Two years ago, after having served four years in the United States Marine Corps and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan, I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city, three days after the earthquake.
Recent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform.
You know, Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself because of what he lost when he came home.
They send him to Iraq.
He leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back.
They send him to Iraq.
This is Martha Payne. Martha's a 9-year-old Scot who lives in the Council of Argyll and Bute.
Thank you for reading. Goodbye."
When the telegraph came along, it was clear that it was going to globalize the news industry.
Instead, what we got was Martin Luther's 95 Theses, the Protestant Reformation, and, you know, the Thirty Years' War. All right, so what all of these predictions of world peace got right is that when a lot of new ideas suddenly come into circulation, it changes society.
This is the cover of "Philosophical Transactions," the first scientific journal ever published in English in the middle of the 1600s, and it was created by a group of people who had been calling themselves "The Invisible College," a group of natural philosophers who only later would call themselves scientists, and they wanted to improve the way natural philosophers argued with each other, and they needed to do two things for this.
So what about us? What about our generation, and our media revolution, the Internet?
To a first approximation, the problem of managing a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay.
It really is Microsoft's Office. It's Adobe's Photoshop.
His point of view on this was very clear.
The first is that it lives up to the philosophical promise of open-source. Everybody who works on a project has access to all of the source code all of the time.
This is cooperation without coordination.
When you make the claim, in fact, that something on the Internet is going to be good for democracy, you often get this reaction.
So there's that as a site for source code management.
This is a called a "diff," this thing on the right here.
This, graphically, was the answer.
That's now the state we're in with these collaboration tools.
The question for us now is, are we going to let the programmers keep it to themselves?
As I said, they were adventurous people.
And that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing.
And that was done over a period of a couple of years, and now we are the leading organization, you know, exploring space on all of your behalf.
That's more on the play side. And on the right side, that's the Rover just before we finished its testing to take it to the Cape to launch it.
The music's half of me, but the other half -- I landed probably the best gig of all.
Why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them?
Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars?
You know, it'll take us only six months to get there.
So, that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events which have happened on that planet.
So, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface, and we actually saw the Rover on the surface.
If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself.
Now, the two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old.
Camera. We have a picture right now.
It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken from the Sahara Desert or somewhere, and you'd have believed me, but these are pictures taken from Mars.
So this was launched about nine months ago.
Looks kind of like an ice cream cone, more or less.
Richard Kornfeld: There is this window of opportunity within which we can deploy the parachute.
But that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part.
And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.
So we are in the process, as we speak, of actually designing the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars.
We have a bunch of Legos. So, as I said, this is a playground for adults, where they sit down and try to play with different shapes and different designs.
To give you an idea of the size, you know, of that parachute relative to the people standing there.
And I know many of you, kind of, last time afterwards said well, that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags.
So it will have an arm which will take samples, put them in an oven, crush and analyze them.
But for scientists, also the rings have a special meaning, because we believe they represent, on a small scale, how the Solar System actually formed.
Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles.
One of them is called Enceladus.
And the reason I showed the little arrow there, I think that should say 30 miles, we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure the material that it is made of.
So it could be Earth, frozen three billion years ago before life actually started on it.
What it turned out, that all that we are seeing, all this liquid, [is made of] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane, similar to what you put in your car.
You barely can see ourselves. So what I did, I thought I'd zoom on it.
And being the current day, of course, we started our own Facebook group.
So if we start to think exponentially, we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us.
Now, I've gained some insight into this.
I don't know if I'd try that yet, but that's available.
And we're layering multiple technologies -- PET scans, CT scans and molecular diagnostics -- to find and to seek things at different levels.
How do you leverage that information?
So even my stethoscope is now digital.
And just last month the first FDA-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices.
Here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room -- I can do some diagnostics that way.
So instead of wearing these kludgy devices, we can put on a simple patch.
There's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate.
And I think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients, and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine, as augmented by these sorts of technologies.
And this is called NOTES, and this is coming -- basically scarless surgery, as mediated by robotic surgery.
He's otherwise completely wheelchair-bound.
You can swallow this completely integrated device.
Again, in early trials, but moving into the future.
Put it on a chip, enable thousands of tests to be done at the point of care, anywhere in the world.
And that's when it gets interesting, when we start to crowdsource that information.
Leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics -- how my genes modulate, what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important, and once in the hands of the individual and the patient, will make better drug dosing and selection available.
We're going to be predictive; we're going to know what you're likely to have.
How about more targeted therapies for cancer?
Now I'll close with regenerative medicine.
It's now been FDA approved, and it'll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so.
So in close, as you think about technology trends and how to impact health and medicine, we're entering an era of miniaturization, decentralization and personalization.
I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject of youth and age.
She'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet.
This is called "The Dress."
Or you could go out by yourself even to a half-block-long empty lot, into the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk, crouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone; already there was wanting to be simpler, wanting, when they called you, never to go back.
And head on my shoulder, hand on my thigh, sang sweetly along, of regrets and depletions she was too young for, as I was too young, later, to believe in her pain.
Medea she was, next time I saw her.
"Behold me," the god of frenzied, inexhaustible love says, rising in bloody splendor, "Behold me."
It's called "Gas."
This is called "Thirst."
Not excrement merely, not merely surface and orifice going unwashed, rediffusion of rum, there was will in it, and intention, power and purpose -- a social, ethical rage and rebellion -- despair too, though, grief, loss.
The dance of our glances, challenge, abdication, effacement, the perfume of our consternation.
Weightfully this self which weighed upon me, the release from which is what I desire and what I achieve.
"Special: big tits," Says the advertisement for a soft-core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand.
The display was a photo. Men and women stripped naked, some trying to cover their genitals, others too frightened to bother, lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch.
So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me, sometimes I think I confound them.
I don't mean that for a moment.
So let's begin with a group of images.
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before.
Samuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said, and I'll quote him, "The Holocaust teaches us that nature, even in its cruelest moments, is benign in comparison with man, when he loses his moral compass and his reason."
In fact, these images became the voices of protest themselves.
Images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other.
In my view, it's not the photographer who makes the photo, it's you.
On May 11th last year, I stood alone at the North geographic Pole.
What we're going to try and do today, in the 16 and a bit minutes I've got left, is to try and answer three questions. The first one is, why?
And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole, geographic North Pole, is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea.
Some very unusual weather conditions, very difficult ice conditions.
We were too late into the summer; the ice was starting to melt; we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio, and they said, "Look boys, you've run out of time.
The second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport, and I could see again, vividly, the camera flashbulbs going off, the paparazzi, the autograph hunters, the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal.
No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own.
The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk, on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir, spelled K-R-A-S.
And I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice.
Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice -- the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean, the wind and the tides.
The weather is just appalling -- oh, drifted back about five miles in the last -- last night.
And this meant I could ski over very thin ice, and if I fell through, it wasn't the end of the world.
Remember, 2001, we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world.
.
Took a few photos. I got my satellite phone out.
I finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket.
This was the view outside my tent when I had this fateful phone call.
So I thought, I've got to compose myself for Troy.
Taxied up and down the runway a few times, just to flatten it out a bit, and he said, "Right, I'm going to -- I'm going to give it a go." And he -- I've now learned that this is standard practice, but it had me worried at the time.
Of course, when you're on the ice, you only ever see one obstacle at a time, whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water.
This, for me, is a chance to explore the limits -- really push the limits of my own potential, see how far they stretch.
Antarctica, if you include the ice shelves, is twice the size of Australia -- it's a big place.
That's pretty much it.
And he explained to me that, when I shave, I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is, but on the right side of my face I was badly burned so I have no hair, and this creates lack of symmetry.
What would happen then?"
Do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently?"
But let me give you a different perspective on the same story.
"Fantastic!" I thought. "Let's throw him out.
They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased.
In my mind, I was actually a knight trying to help science move along.
They'd been struck by a sperm whale, which had ripped a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.
We know how fear feels, but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about what our fears mean.
What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination, something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself?
So the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear from visionaries and young children?
So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner.
It's a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do.
Fears also have suspense.
What would happen to our days? What would happen to our crops?
So that way, if their worst fears came true, their businesses were ready.
After more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food as they knew they might, and they were still quite far from land.
As we've seen, the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part.
Properly read, our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature: a little wisdom, a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing -- the truth.
[... in the dark] So what is the difference, then, between the way I believe science is pursued and the way it seems to be perceived?
So I began to realize, by the end of this course, that the students maybe were getting the idea that we must know everything there is to know about the brain.
I have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of Marie Curie, because I am convinced that that glow behind her is not a photographic effect.
You can find all sorts of information there. It's wide open.
So that's the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today, but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts?
I have to get out of here actually. I have to go read.
So this leads us to maybe think about, a little bit about, some of the models of science that we tend to use, and I'd like to disabuse you of some of them.
Another one, a kind of popular one, is the iceberg idea, that we only see the tip of the iceberg but underneath is where most of the iceberg is hidden.
As it turns out, he kind of cribbed that from the philosopher Immanuel Kant who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea of question propagation, that every answer begets more questions.
Sometimes we call them bull sessions.
So let's put a point on the graph. There's an undergraduate.
So instead of how much you know about it, we could say, "What can you ask about it?"
That seems kind of simple, somehow or another.
We have TV, we have movies, we have animation, we have photography, we have pattern recognition, all of these sorts of things.
I'll give you an example from my own lab, my own particularly smelly question, since we work on the sense of smell.
So there are two really interesting questions here, it seems to me.
And it's this abiding by ignorance that I think we have to learn how to do.
We currently have an educational system which is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing.
I think this comes from what a teacher colleague of mine calls "the bulimic method of education."
Evaluation is one thing. You hear a lot about evaluation in the literature these days, in the educational literature, but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts to an opportunity for trial and error.
That's the one I like in particular.
And the war ended with a regime change, like the one in Afghanistan.
And this is why they revolted.
Now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived.
They found something called Facebook.
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.
We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world -- and internationally, globally, through our English channel.
And while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change, before we thought, and governments told us -- and even sometimes it was true -- that change was imposed on us, and people rejected that, because they thought that it is alien to their culture.
Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories.
We do not create revolutions.
I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them, "Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night, because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story -- and they feel protected as well."
But the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world, for the West and the East, to see stability and to see security and to see friendship and to see tolerance emerging from the Arab world, rather than the images of violence and terrorism.
How would you characterize the historical significance of what's happened?
And this is what the story's all about.
Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us, the head of Aljazeera.net, he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world.
Thank you so much.
People do get HIV because they do stupid things, but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons.
And so everyone lined up, all the smackheads in a row, and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit, and he went down and started injecting people.
And if there's one place you really want to get high, it's when you're in jail.
We're actually interviewing people on the street, in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.
"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail."
We've got what's rational for public health.
So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention, she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on, and obviously those are much higher.
Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too, and they're responding to what they think the voters want.
Okay, seriously, HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually.
They are gay men on the party scene who have, on average, three times more partners than straight people on the party scene.
In most of the world, these few prevention failures notwithstanding, we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex: condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries.
He's from Haiti and he has AIDS.
Well, you die, so your viral load goes to zero.
And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS, and rightly so.
This is of new infections.
It doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view.
So it's not a great job, but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice.
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale.
She was 105 years old when I took this picture.
Well, my true love's a black-eyed daisy; if I don't see her, I go crazy.
A double outhouse over here on the side.
Let's have the banjo.
This is Ralph Stanley.
So I went back that very summer.
The Old Jack tales that he had learned -- he talked like this, you could hardly understand him. But it was really wonderful.
It was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument.
Ain't that a sound?
Well, my mom didn't put up with much either, and she was driving, and she said, "You boys! You think you can have anything you want.
She went up to the foreman; she said, "I've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives."
She wasn't going to give up.
Good news: Chariot's coming.
No, we learned something else.
Try this old song with me. I sing: Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.
There's a starry crown in heaven, I know.
My mom was in the audience.
And I don't want it to leave me behind.
Fifteen years ago, 14 years ago, I guess, this year, my wife and I lost our daughter, Sarah Jane, in a car accident, and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world.
And for me, the sound of a steel guitar, because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things.
People say, "Oh, snap out of it!"
We moved to California when Sputnik went up, in 1957.
Well, I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad; so did Michael.
We stood back, we lit that thing, and they flew out of there -- they went through that plywood like it was paper.
They said, we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel.
No hair, no eyelashes, no nothing.
I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday; I'm going to be doing some of the same ones.
We want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done.
So how does it work?
Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy, but there has been, historically, a relationship between how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is, and how people think about the society that they live in.
And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought of John Locke and his collaborators.
Of who else there is, of the history and so forth.
There's only where it is relative to everything else that is.
And not only that, they make the analogy to relativity theory and cosmology often.
So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization.
In the 20th century, we saw the independent development of two big themes in science.
Now, if you think about democracy from this perspective, a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests, many different agendas, many different individuals, many different points of view.
In that year, we are not available for any of our clients.
Quite the similar idea, then, a perfume packaged in a book, in a die cut.
I can see my work as a job. I do it for money.
Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing because I knew them too well. So Asia it was.
Every single dog on one tee shirt.
This one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.
And at the same time, I'm extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses.
His latest numbers are fairly impressive.
That's about five percent of everybody.
Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.
Financially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.
Which I understood after I translated it from architecture speech in to regular English, basically as logo making.
So it will always fit together, conceptually, of course.
Like this Donna Toney poster, or Chopin, or Mozart, or La Monte Young.
And the whole series of work came out of it.
These are some pictures visitors sent to me.
So when it was finally done, and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry, one of the neighbors called the police.
They weren't quite slick enough.
That film we'll be working on for the next two years.
But what if that intimacy began long before you faced your own transition from life into death?
So even as we share death as a universal experience, it's not experienced the same way the world over.
Until the funeral ceremony, which can be held years after a person's physical death, the deceased is referred to as "to makala," a sick person, or "to mama," a person who is asleep, and they continue to be a member of the household.
This is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition in their relationship to the deceased, and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who's living to relating to the deceased as a person who's an ancestor.
And this metaphor of membership in the greater human family is the way that children also describe the money that they invest in these sacrificial buffaloes that are thought to carry people's soul from here to the afterlife, and children will explain that they will invest the money in this because they want to repay their parents the debt for all of the years their parents spent investing and caring for them.
So by having death as a part of the cultural and social fabric of life, people's everyday decisions about their health and healthcare are affected.
People ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed by participating in a culture where the physical manifestations of death greet us at every turn.
Perhaps one of the answers to the challenges that are facing the U.S. healthcare system, particularly in the end-of-life care, is as simple as a shift in perspective, and the shift in perspective in this case would be to look at the social life of every death.
And what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend."
And so this morning I thought, "Oh well, I'll just do a card trick."
Thank you. Bruno's face, just then, he said, "No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't.
But you do meet some fantastic people, people who look at the world in a totally different way.
Her talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course, the link between Darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this -- we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well.
I'm so sorry. No, no.
No time, unfortunately, to mention those."
That reminds me, I must post that letter."
These extraordinary things, Icelandic Internet accounts.
And making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult.
And then you got the unknown unknowns, those are the things we don't know we don't know."
America has now elected its first openly black President.
I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it?
They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda.
But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration.
And Jack Nicholson just says, "You make me want to be a better man."
5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it."
So, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton.
And I, you know."
"Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh."
I'm going to talk about dinosaurs.
And I usually just say, "Well dinosaurs were big, different and gone."
They went out and gathered them up.
They're all big.
They like to name anything.
They're basically retaining their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny.
But scientists have egos; they like to name things.
So they don't normally let you do that.
And there are 12 of them that everyone recognizes -- I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs that went extinct.
And everybody knows that these three animals are related.
It's got a little, tiny dome, and it's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose.
Dracorex is the littlest one, Stygimoloch is the middle size one, Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one.
The dome, that little dome, is growing really fast.
So a colleague of mine at Berkley, he and I were looking at Triceratops.
And everybody says it's because I have a little museum.
And the middle size one is really spongy.
And I said, "Well do we have any juvenile Torosauruses?"
I mean, here's Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan.
So there's these two dinosaurs, T. Rex and Nanotyrannus.
And at the Museum of the Rockies where we work, I have four T. Rexes, so I can cut a whole bunch of them.
Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs, they memorize them.
And these are everyday conventions, conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.
High definition, in our opinion, has become the new orthodoxy.
So, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why.
So here the world is put out of focus, while our visual dependence is put into focus.
And this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar.
"Master/Slave" at the MOMA, the project series, a piece called "Parasite."
We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation.
It selects a point, it guides the drill to that point, it pierces the dry wall, leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location.
So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display, the wall now actively competed for attention.
Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall.
But culminating -- and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk -- is this Mediatheque, which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building.
We're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions.
We basically did a striptease, architectural striptease, where we're framing with this kind of canopy -- the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard, about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway, and then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall.
Intimacy for us means a lot of different things.
First we do a kind of partial box and box separation, to take away the distraction of the subway noise.
And what it entails is the use of resin, of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall, in a kind of seamless continuity that wraps the hall in light, like a belt of light: rather than separating, like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers, it connects audience with players.
I just didn't think that, in 2011, women would still be in that category.
They might be sexually provocative.
"Drawn into this," like they were seduced into committing an act of violence.
We also have our own unconscious biases, but the Times makes it sound like anyone would have reported this story the same way.
Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goode is what made this story more complete.
Wired magazine, November 2010.
A voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds.
Now, Fast Company Magazine embraces that idea.
Shankar Vedantam is the author of "The Hidden Brain: How Our Unconscious Minds Elect Presidents, Control Markets, Wage Wars, and Save Our Lives."
This is an important point to consider, because much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries where the treatment of women is an issue, such as Afghanistan.
But this is not just a job for super-journalists, or my organization. You all have a stake in a strong, vibrant media.
But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what's going on.
We need four shoulder-high plants per person, and in terms of plant care, we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi, and perhaps once a week in cleaner-air cities.
And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants.
It is also important for the environment, because the world's energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade.
M Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen.
I said, "Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent."
PM: So is this a good idea.
And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it.
And I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council -- so 14 men sat there staring at me, and I thought -- well you know how we all are.
PM: Because in her lifetime -- M That would be so.
PM: And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy?
Now there are 192.
And we lobbied on behalf of women's issues.
But the bottom line is that there is a way, when there are more women at the table, that there's an attempt to develop some understanding.
We went to a meeting, and the men in my delegation, when I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this," and they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?"
More men who believe that the balance is best?
And my motto is that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other.
Then I thought, let's go even further than 25 years.
They turn a social network from virtual to actual, and kind of rebooted the 21st century.
Look at the pictures these data sets print.
Seven thousand kids a day. Here's two of them.
Now, the rate is still too high -- still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives.
For number-crunchers like us, that is the erogenous zone, and it's fair to say that I am, by now, sexually aroused by the collating of data.
How about that?
It's called inertia. It's how we screw it up.
You can tell politicians that these cuts [can cost] lives.
And technology is really turbocharging this.
2030? By 2030, robots, not just serving us Guinness, but drinking it.
Because as is obvious, factivists have feelings too.
Wael is right.
Would we see 544 airline pilots held captive in their jumbo jets on a runway for months, or a year?
Shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade.
[$60.2 billion] Now why is this?
And one of the first things that surprised me when I got on board Kendal was, where are all the people?
They're at sea for months at a time, and even when they're on board, they don't have access to what a five-year-old would take for granted, the Internet.
And that was a surprise to me.
And that's because shipping has very tight margins, and they want cheap fuel, so they use something called bunker fuel, which was described to me by someone in the tanker industry as the dregs of the refinery, or just one step up from asphalt.
But why has it taken so long?
And the acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to 90 percent.
But I also want to see shipping, and us, the general public, who know so little about it, to have a bit more scrutiny, to be a bit more transparent, to have 90 percent transparency.
So now, if you take this metaphor [of] genome as program seriously, you have to consider that Chris Anderson is a computer-fabricated artifact, as is Jim Watson, Craig Venter, as are all of us.
So now, all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology, and it shows the power of molecular programs -- biology does.
There's the solar panels of the cell, some switches that turn your genes on and off, the girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles.
And if I haven't revealed my prejudices already, I think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers, building electronic computers, which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers, which will build new electronic computers, and so forth.
He asked, how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism?
But for some tasks, we can start to answer them.
But a lot of their approaches, though elegant, take a long time.
And here's how we do it.
When you look at DNA origami, you can see that what it really is, even though you think it's complicated, is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other, and they're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one.
And each one of these is just one-thousandth the width of a human hair, OK?
And so, I got this in the mail about a year after I did this, unsolicited.
Let the thing assemble, and you'll get some kind of a circuit.
So, you start with something in the computer.
We're going to turn to another technology, called algorithmic self-assembly of tiles.
So you can read off binary numbers five, six and seven.
So now, we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than DNA origami could otherwise.
Now, this -- using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question.
So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles -- rather than to the staple strands, you affix them to the tiles -- then they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits, the demultiplexer circuits, that you need to address this memory.
So, it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago, and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things, so I think we made a lot of progress.
What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light, asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things. Thank you.
So, I share it with all of you here today, though the idea itself is getting crystallized and I'm still writing up the business plan.
But as we envisioned it, we had three key goals: Providing world-class life support ambulance service which is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams, and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency, irrespective of the capability to pay.
One is Education Access for All, setting up schools in small-town India.
And the demand side being mostly politicians, bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them.
But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption?
Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe.
And it is an absolutely virgin market.
As my close friend replied, when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project that it is an impossible task and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs, I quote: "Of course we cannot fail in this, at least in our own minds.
The officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes.
But if it's a 3,000-rupee, 70-dollar bribe, what fee would you have to charge, and can you actually make the business work?
Eric Berlow: I'm an ecologist, and Sean's a physicist, and we both study complex networks.
But we can also pull up, using speech-to-text translation, we can pull the entire transcript, and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself.
So what we've got here now is the global footprint of all the TEDx Talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from New York all the way down to little old New Zealand in the corner.
SG: Absolutely. So I got a little quick on that, but he's going to slow me down.
And of course, from here, we can go and zoom in and see, well, what are young people looking at?
And a few rise to the surface.
And I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface that's maybe really creative and interesting?
We could go the other direction and say, well, what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields.
And all of this comes from the architecture of complexity, or the patterns of how things are connected.
Masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers, camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed but need hugs.
Trained at a young age to capitalize, letters taught now that capitalism raises you but you have to step on someone else to get there.
But what did he appeal to?
Let me begin with an example.
And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day, every day who, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule, as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.
You need permission to be allowed to improvise, try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.
It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.
And the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it, and called the police, who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.
But the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing: "We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure."
Better ones, more of them.
And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules, rules and incentives may make things better in the short run, but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run.
Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.
We need more rules for the bankers, God knows.
I'll just give you one example because time is racing.
The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.
Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will.
A few sources of hope: we ought to try to re-moralize work.
Well, acknowledge them.
Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes.
Because it took the will to do the right thing.
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.
One is that we are always teaching.
They need to learn to respect their teachers.
Right again.
You have to go and stand out here a sec.
A few years ago I was visited by the guy that runs DARPA, the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing.
Now we've got F18s and F22s, and if somebody loses an arm, we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it."
Either way they were going to eat it.
But compared to that, losing two?
Did a little investigation, went down to Washington, told them I still think they're nuts but we're going to do it.
At the end of exactly one year we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom, all the sensors, all the microprocessors, all the stuff inside.
He picks up a spoon, picks it up, scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk, holds the spoon level as he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously, to his mouth, and he doesn't drop any milk.
And just as in the spirit of FIRST, gracious professionalism, they are quite proud of this, so they decide to share a drink.
I'll give you some astounding things that have happened as we started this.
We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong.
"Well, would it help if I ..."
I lost my right arm, but I'm a lefty."
They're not finished giving yet."
We're screaming along.
Half of his face is gone, but they said his vision is coming back.
And I turned around and went, "How are we going to do this?"
"You need to come."
Who is entitled to how much?
How do we get out?
But you know what? It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous.
And we ought to give it to them.
Science is clever, but great creativity is something less knowable, more magical. And now we need that magic.
A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle.
"I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here.
Great creativity is needed to take it all, make it simple and sharp.
I lived there with nothing but water.
There was so many skeptics, especially the press in London, that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me.
He was underneath, not breathing for 45 minutes.
So, I took that as a challenge, basically.
This is a little hard to watch.
Then I started thinking, would it be possible to hook up a heart/lung bypass machine and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery, and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood?
There is depth records, where people go as deep as they can.
Purging is basically hyperventilating.
Then I would breath again for a minute, purging as hard as I can, then immediately after that I would hold again for five and half minutes.
And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath.
And I started to really adapt my body.
I assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln center and if I stayed there a week not eating, I would get comfortable in that situation and I would slow my metabolism, which I was sure would help me hold my breath longer than I had been able to do it.
By 7:08 I started to black out.
So, I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night.
There was one person there that was definitely not impressed.
Now, I wanted to get the Science Times to document this.
I completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what I needed to do.
So, every time my heart would beat I'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep, you know, the ticking, really loud.
And the heart rate just kept going up and up, all the way up to 150 beats.
At 11 minutes I started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs, and my lips started to feel really strange.
And I started having ischemia to the heart.
They had doctors with the "Pst," you know, so, sitting there waiting.
So, I get to New York City the next day, and this kid walks up to me -- I'm walking out of the Apple store -- this kid walks up to me he's like, "Yo, D!"
A public, Dewey long ago observed, is constituted through discussion and debate.
But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems.
We live in one world.
Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context.
And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence, administrative control, management of public finances, investment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights, provision of infrastructure, management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation, creation of the market, international agreements, including public borrowing, and then, most importantly, rule of law.
Money is not capital in most of the developing countries.
What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re-engage in a project, that capital formation is rapid?
You're great designers, but your designs are selfish.
Is the country gonna make it?
Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down.
Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism -- from all sides.
Those were the risks. They were worth it.
And I told them -- my people, with the Americans here -- separate.
That gives me hope.
If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment, we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector, if there was zero tariffs -- would create the type of job.
With the Put Out system?
AG: No. It's not that it didn't work.
And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy.
Matt Mills: Now, what's great about this is, there's no trickery here.
Now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin.
MM: Awesome. Thank you.
What's great about this is, the tools to do this are free.
Oh, that is so cool.
One, two, three. Go!
It's completely free to download this application.
I'm going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it, the problems and the opportunities that we face, and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic.
Well, it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps.
For those of us in this room, it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual, it's the community, it's the culture, it's the world itself.
That's why they migrate to cities.
Increasingly, I would say explosive growth of technology.
Last year, there were 85,000 riots in China, 230 a day, that required police or military intervention.
For us, where does it take us, as social activists and entrepreneurs?
Let's go up and take a look at the Himalayas.
This is the difficulty that one country faces.
And then we watched, as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States and it marched every year, westwardly.
We've seen the eradication of smallpox.
But they're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did.
Six months ago, a group of business activists gathered together to join with the Republican governor in California to pass AB 32, the most far-reaching legislation in environmental history.
And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air.
In the last century -- that's the one that was seven years ago -- half a billion people died from smallpox: more than all the wars in history, more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world.
And they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox, and they went home to die.
Thank you very much.
And that has been the second great -- couple 100,000 years, 150,000 years -- flow of our evolution.
Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like.
This is a cama.
None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.
Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.
And in fact, right now in many states, you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets.
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision on whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish -- it'll be sold in the stores.
But if you can clone that horse, you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud.
Same thing happened with the mouflon, where it's an endangered species of sheep.
And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top, and it's on a big computer tracking ball.
They put them about one inch above the ground, and then they shut everything off and they go pfft.
They have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going.
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm, which you see here in the picture, put the arm in another room.
And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.
So, we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes.
But in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like.
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say, "Look, I want a dog.
It confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now.
And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book, "On the Origin of Species," published 150 years ago.
But much later, in 1871, he did have something to say about it.
And for many decades now there have been a series of TOMS satellites that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface.
What's very, very important here is that the earliest humans evolved in high-UV environments, in equatorial Africa.
It's very destructive, but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin, vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones, the health of our immune system, and myriad other important functions in our bodies.
And humans dispersed -- not once, but twice.
So people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments were bereft of the potential to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year.
And just in the last 5,000 years, in increasing rates, over increasing distances.
Well, often we're unaware of the fact that we're living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly adapted.
So we have, in skin pigmentation, one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today.
But we need to think about how he compares, in terms of his pigmentation, to other people on Earth.
You just have to look at your skin.
Take your skin color, and celebrate it.
Well, the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar because it's very old.
So let me show you a few objects.
And then you cut again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, and you still get small cauliflowers.
Now, it didn't take me any time.
This is very rough, and this is sort of smooth, and this perfectly smooth.
What good is that, to know these things?
If you take this thing, you know very well it weighs very little.
Now, what good is it to have that?
This cloud is completely, 100 percent artificial.
One of the shattering events in the history of mathematics, which is not appreciated by many people, occurred about 130 years ago, 145 years ago.
And so here I introduce something, the set of rivers of a plane-filling curve.
The things on the ground are algae.
Could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new?
Again, again, again.
What got you to be, at the same time, a mechanical engineer, a geographer and a mathematician and so on, a physicist?
Well, these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which I did.
Acts of God." In this picture, five acts of God are as important as everything else.
And after the war, I saw an uncle again.
The equation is hidden there, z goes into z squared, plus c.
And that was one of my major discoveries, to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing, more or less.
In 1990, I was in Cambridge, U.K.
I want to start on a slightly somber note.
And these were being pressed upon us by the doctors.
Or are there contexts where we're far better off taking the passenger's seat and have someone else drive?
Now, why do you have to consume the tea?
Now, for you folks, what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you these two teas, and I'm asking you, I'll go ahead and ask you, to choose your tea. So you can choose which of the two tea you want.
We'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects.
Right? So these have been calibrated to your level of expertise.
And systemically what we will show, across a series of studies, is that you, the passengers, even though the tea was picked for you at random, will end up solving more puzzles than you, the drivers.
So, you're putting in less juice, and therefore the outcome: fewer puzzles solved.
In terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles.
So what do you do?
Now, I started off on the somber note.
After all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few, but a fundamental human right for all.
In 1984, in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity, nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth, Ethiopia.
There are eight times more tractors in Latin America, and three times more tractors in Asia, than in Africa.
And one thing is clear, which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business.
The market reforms prompted by the West -- and I've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets, and have interviewed traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent, hundreds of traders -- trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform.
And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me over and over -- that's the only way people know what they're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality.
And in my view, there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in Africa today face.
This is a tragic example of arrested development, or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks.
When conditions are right, we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa, just like anywhere else.
In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market.
And we're seeing a shift -- powered mainly because of information technology -- a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets.
In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia, we've done something rather unique, which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective, or what we call the ECX Edge.
And in turn, we'll operate an in-house clearing system, to assure that payment is done appropriately, in the right amount and at the right time, so that basically, we create trust and integrity in the system.
So all of this will transform farmers.
The last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today.
So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture, and to change Africa.
The threat is desertification.
Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone.
And this is the region most closely associated with desertification.
So, we get climate change.
So, they moved the entire village, hut by hut.
If you want to stop a sand dune from moving, what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest.
Inside of the dunes we find shade.
It takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it.
I'm not an economist, very much not, but I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation -- -- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars.
So, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone, and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.
Some people believe that this would spread uncontrollably, and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way.
But, if I had something like a TED wish, it would be to actually get it built, to start building this habitable wall, this very, very long, but very narrow city in the desert, built into the dunescape itself.
Hi, my name is Marcin -- farmer, technologist.
The world presented me with options, and I took them.
So I did just that.
We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways.
If this idea is truly sound, then the implications are significant.
To go back to that toilet, it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet, it wasn't as nice as this one from the World Toilet Organization.
But he should, because the problem with all that poop lying around is that poop carries passengers.
Still not sure about the bikini.
These are cholera beds in Haiti.
We don't have a neutral word for it.
And I think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development, because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us.
It's got nutrients in it.
Here's a woman who's about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes, which is what you think it is, except not quite, because it's actually donated.
So you'd be thinking by now, okay, the solution's simple, we give everyone a toilet.
In India now there's a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don't have a toilet.
And she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around.
Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera.
But there are things to worry about.
They talk about it. They've sanitized it.
I'm an ecologist, mostly a coral reef ecologist.
We were the best and the brightest.
And we published a paper in Science, the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane.
There are tens of thousands of those stories out there, and it's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well-being, because it just keeps getting worse.
It's a little hard to understand that, because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish.
And people paid less in 1950 dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little, tiny fish.
This is a photograph, a typical photograph, of what the continental shelves of the world look like.
A book was written about it.
It's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.
That picture on the left is just staggering to me.
And I said, "So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu' because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota, where it's clean and safe.
Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the Northwest Passage.
Except it's supposed to be brown.
And then you read in the paper a few weeks later, "Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died."
Well, there won't be any fish except for minnows, and the water will be pretty dirty, and all those kinds of things and full of mercury, etc., etc.
And, at the same time, water from the surface, which is rich in oxygen, doesn't make it down and the ocean turns into a desert.
In the summer of 1950, Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist and atomic-pile builder, went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question: "Where is everybody?"
And yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone.
The other possibility -- -- is, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himself was an alien.
It's a difficult theory to discount, I think you'll agree.
Occasionally, kids would come and join me and watch, but their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans.
But what was stranger still -- and even I realized it at the time, as a nine-year-old child -- was that they stopped at all.
I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.
And they turned at once and walked away.
She had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket.
That's when she turned to me and said, "Are you looking forward to seeing the movie?"
He could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world.
When I say it out loud, it sounds so ridiculous, but I can only come to the conclusion that it was what, in the alien abductee community, they call a "screen memory": a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma -- say, of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid.
And it was so successful that they made it into a movie.
Something odd? Something off? Something wrong with this picture?
We went to some topless beaches.
I remember what she looked like before she left.
Nervous, I went down to the street to look for her.
And that's when the Liberians came along.
The stars aligned, and she came back.
And hope actually is at the heart of this.
Trash the system or crash the planet -- it's a tough choice; it isn't much of a choice.
How much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets?
So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics.
And what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth.
And here, all of a sudden, we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic -- the economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together to drive an engine of growth.
This was the last 15 years before the crash, and you can see there, consumer debt rose dramatically.
Is this really how economies behave?"
It's an anomaly, it's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people.
"Here they are, the giraffes."
"It is," she said, "to help create the social world and find a credible place in it."
And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view, another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors and tradition or conservation.
It is about opening up.
So we can do that here -- we can just put in a little search term.
It's a form, if you like, of ecological altruism -- perhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that.
It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they didn't have food, clothing and shelter.
It's clear that we have a responsibility to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations.
It's not about trying to change human nature.
Tim Jackson: Well that's clearly not what you're doing.
But it has to have political leadership.
And yes, it's an acrylic painting of a man, but I didn't paint it on canvas.
But originally, this had nothing to do with either people or paint.
But something kept on flickering before my eyes.
The last time I'd painted, I was 16 years old at summer camp, and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and practicing over and over again on that surface, because that's not what this project was about for me.
One of my favorite models actually ended up being a retired old man who not only didn't mind sitting still and getting the paint in his ears, but he also didn't really have much embarrassment about being taken out into very public places for exhibition, like the Metro.
And one time, she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face.
And what you see here is, you see a little bit of crude oil, you see some ice cubes, and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm.
So there it is; the retinas are baking.
Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water.
It also makes it very viscous.
No, they think, "Ugh. I have to go buy gas.
And the thing is, too, is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume, which is somewhat reasonable, because in fact, we have designed this system where, if you want to get a job, it's much more important to have a car that runs, to have a job and keep a job, than to have a GED.
And we get kind of in on our own con.
This is an early-on photograph -- you can see, we had these gushers.
And it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy.
So, you might be wondering why it is that, every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill, we call these CEOs down to Washington, and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them.
You have these pictures of birds.
We connect the dots in the supply chain.
In fact, it's continued to increase.
And these guys, I mean, if they were in the U.S., they might be actually here in this room.
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out, and we realized it was okay.
Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico -- as you can see, this is the Minerals Management diagram of wells for gas and oil.
And the same thing happens at the 50th percentile, around 80,000.
We need to focus on reducing the oil.
We need to have more mobility choices.
I actually -- I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much, but I think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline, and upped it to six cents next year, nine cents the following year, all the way up to 30 cents by 2020, that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption, and at the same time we would give people time to prepare, time to respond, and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time.
And also, the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system.
Well, you probably recognize the first person.
We are late to watch "Afghan Star."
People become so engaged that they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway, who fan out over the countryside, campaigning for their candidate.
Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out, to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition.
But actually, just the opposite is happening.
So for me, the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving reality.
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible.
And I firmly believe that what we're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great, big battleground on this earth.
So it's right up in the heavens.
And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice.
And then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on.
And my team just gave it to me straight.
This is the time to swim with real humility.
The warning signs are all there.
I usually say to people, when they say, "What do you do?"
Now, TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker about "do this, do that" and you fill out all these forms, and you don't actually know how they're going to describe you, and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist.
This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight and a few other very, very bright individuals.
So this is interesting in the sense that you can now do "if-then-for" statements in materials, in structure.
And that's what I thought about for a long time, because this is how we currently make things.
I thought about this in the sense that it's great to build in biological materials, but can we do similar things?
In a neutral state, they won't bind at all.
We set them off on this air hockey table.
So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process.
Not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point, but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic, are the computers.
You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure -- so that's part of the extra program.
That's next year's Yves Klein, you know, eyeglasses shape.
Just by thinking about the physics of the world, materials as the computer, you can start to do things like this.
And I think this applies across a very broad -- sort of, a lot of concepts.
How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas, and see the world in a different way? And it's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe -- it's sort of an analog computer.
So that's a kite the size of your house.
And it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face.
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species.
Basically, we substitute, in our lives, access to the things we want.
Increasingly, we're realizing that we don't even need to densify an entire city.
And people are embracing this.
It did tell me that this route maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths, though.
And so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time, use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.
In fact, when we use all these things, what we've found is that, in some cases, energy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent.
We have visions like this. We have visions like this.
Because right now, our economy by and large operates as Paul Hawken said, "by stealing the future, selling it in the present and calling it GDP."
Now, in the decade of Darfur and Iraq, a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene. But I'm going to try to convince you that that is the correct picture. The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon. You can see it over millennia, over centuries, over decades and over years, although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century. One sees it all over the world, although not homogeneously.
Well, let's click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude, and look at the century scale.
Let's click down now to the decade scale.
There's a cognitive illusion. We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something, the higher the probability that you assign to it.
Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought, and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first.
In earlier times, when suffering and early death were common in one's own life, one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on others. And as technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant, one puts a higher value on life in general.
It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism, by histories, and journalism, and memoirs, and realistic fiction, and travel, and literacy, which allows you to project yourself into the lives of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human, and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station in life, the sense that "there but for fortune go I."
I am a reformed marketer, and I now work in international development.
And due to the poor infrastructure, only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.
Joseph and Christine, who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms, said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost, and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them, their customers don't buy the branded versions.
Sex!
And so the lesson is this: it doesn't really matter what you're selling; you just have to think about who is your customer, and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior.
"We learned it in college."
So, you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family. One, two, three, four, five children per woman on this axis.
And you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime.
So the problem I had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born.
But if I would change this axis here, I would instead put income per person.
And the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years, on par with Afghanistan today.
And then we come up. Not until independence started.
Whereas when my oldest son, who works for Google, he should develop by quarter, or by half-year.
So to me, as a public health professor, it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now.
Well, one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution.
And it goes over here?
We have all this at the same time.
But when I split it, when I split it into country bubbles, the size of the bubbles here is the population.
It's Lincoln here, advancing them.
It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring during 25 years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what's happening in the world.
And I'm not paid to come here, no.
We have a continuum. But we still have, of course, Congo, up there. We still have as poor countries as we have had, always, in history.
That's where we were, 1900.
They get safe water, they get food for the poor, and they get malaria eradicated.
We have to do real-time competition."
All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals.
The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected.
They have a very high level. It's coming down.
And this is the situation you see.
It's similar to other nutritional diseases.
That has now disappeared, and they are now in great economic problem.
And this institution will have a very crucial role, not for United States, but for the world.
But I didn't, OK. So we're here. I'll do what I can. I'll do what I can.
But then at some point, one of these multicellular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff, which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution: cultural evolution.
And this.
So you had social complexity spanning the whole continent, even if no polity did similarly. Today, you've got nation states.
A lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation.
It doesn't necessarily predict a win-win outcome.
I kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality.
And one reason is because of something I call the "growing lethality of hatred."
So let's call it the death spiral of negativity.
There's going to have to be moral progress.
Doing the best I can, OK.
Because to understand why somebody in a very different culture does something -- somebody you're kind of viewing as alien, who's doing things you consider strange in a culture you consider strange -- to really understand why they do the things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment, because you've got to relate their experience to yours.
I think it's the first step toward that. That's the long-term goal.
If you look at the word "salvation" in the Bible -- the Christian usage that we're familiar with -- saving souls, that people go to heaven -- that's actually a latecomer.
Every single thing I planned to say, they have said it here, and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.
An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP, and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries.
Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audience.
I want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknesses.
Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines, ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them.
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today?
Which country is that?
We haven't exported one kilogram yet.
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.
If the government's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people, such a government is driven by self-interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion.
In the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined from the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy- implementation process in our countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.
In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.
Agriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens, takes only 18 billion.
You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.
When I was president of the American Psychological Association, they tried to media-train me, and an encounter I had with CNN summarizes what I'm going to be talking about today, which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic.
"Cut. Cut. That won't do.
"Not good enough." And that's what I'm going to be talking about.
And now, 14 of the disorders are treatable, two of them actually curable.
And I think that's terrific. I'm proud of it.
And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier, positive interventions.
And any of you, for free, can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness.
The one way in which they differ: they're extremely social.
That is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier?
And third, the meaningful life.
And this leads to the second life.
American women said to Len, when he dated them, "You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost."
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about, about flow. And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way.
Re-crafting your work, your love, your play, your friendship, your parenting.
You don't giggle a lot. What you get is more absorption.
It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works.
Now, OK, you can open your eyes.
When you do something philanthropic to help another person, it lasts and it lasts.
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong.
I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much, which was one of the remarkable things.
And so, the parallel thing holds with technology, entertainment and design, I believe.
This is an icon of National Geographic, an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry.
Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth -- they're not very good swimmers -- and we know what's happening to the ice.
And this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason.
I can see his hands reaching out, and I can see his face in terror, looking at me, saying, "Help me, Dad."
I thought I was a hero.
But even more importantly, you need to know how to create a visual narrative.
These are baboons at a watering hole.
It was with the elephants that this story pivoted.
And they only came for the ivory.
For the first time in history, more people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.
And he did it in a beautiful way.
And here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.
Jim started in the battlefield.
But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it, just plain fun.
And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.
Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.
This is her just puffing out, you know, snorting out in disgust.
How about a moderate amount of stress?
But I have changed my mind about stress, and today, I want to change yours.
In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had relatively little stress.
It's called the social stress test.
You're going to do this out loud as fast as you can, starting with 996.
Now, if you were actually in this study, you'd probably be a little stressed out.
And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance, well, they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident, but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed.
So my goal as a health psychologist has changed.
It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone, because it's released when you hug someone.
But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin.
Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain.
And listen up, because this study could also save a life.
How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress.
It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy.
We cannot get medicine to them reliably, they cannot get critical supplies, and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income.
Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali, and have a newborn in need of urgent medication.
It's a network for a transportation of matter.
Today, we're using small quads.
They are at known locations on the ground, so the paths between them are also known, which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network.
So this is a $3,000 vehicle.
And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho for transportation of HIV/AIDS samples.
If it is a new paradigm, though, there must be other uses for it.
So we think it makes sense in those places to set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the Internet, initially for lightweight, urgent stuff, and over time, we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem.
It would give us an unfair advantage against battling HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics.
As a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering, in order to believe whether these things are realistic.
And we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face, and different principle directions of light from the light stage, to figure out both the coarse-scale and the fine-scale detail of her face.
So, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection, we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape, and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.
Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.
And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.
We specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films.
And let's take a look at a computer-generated version of Bruce, running in a new environment.
What I've been doing from 14 to 17 was, I was assisting them collecting ivory tusk, meat and whatever they were killing, poaching, hunting in the forest, bring it in the main city to get access to the market.
I was having my inscriptions, my admission to biology.
That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve with some animals and also plants.
Thirteen species -- highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa.
So they started fleeing from the east to the west.
And even people who faced the rebellion of 1963, after our independence, they didn't believe what was happening.
And I was from the same area to him.
That is people moving around, that's even Pygmies.
And that was the language of the war.
And that is me, going to, hurrying to Uganda, to try to save that 4,000 material, with people carrying them on the bikes, bicycles.
And the reserve was a target to the rebels.
That is Coltan extraction, gold mining.
And we continued.
I don't know how many people I had on my address.
I said, "I have never seen it.
Because there was no way -- whatever they do, it's known the same time.
I oppose it -- that they are now going to dissect it, until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander.
And they supported me a bit, and I built this.
But now I think that I would have titled it, "The Language of Guns."
I don't think that someone may blame Google, because it's doing the right things, even if people like Al-Qaeda are using Google to connect between them.
Corneille Ewango: That's really embarrassing questions.
And go -- now, I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D.
Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that I'll talk a little bit about.
But we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations.
The deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water.
Next year I'll be leading an international team to J2.
And we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.
To experience it is a privilege.
For those who have never seen this story, Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple of years ago, called "Aliens of the Deep."
You need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle.
There are two primary targets we're doing here.
No hands at the wheel.
The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.
Go, go, go.
You'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon.
And we can extend that now to just about everything.
You can dive into the stratosphere, and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.
There's a myth that you can't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.
I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.

Eighty-two dollars a night.
Paid line standing.
Now, why worry? Why worry about our becoming market societies?
I'd like to take an example of a controversial use of a market mechanism, a cash incentive, and see what you think about it.
Imagine that you are the head of a major school system, and someone comes to you with this proposal.
What would be your reason?
Now, let's see if there's someone who favors, who thinks it's worth trying this.
I should tell you what's happened with these experiments.
This may be true enough if we're talking about material goods.
For fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions.
What matters is that people of different social backgrounds and different walks of life encounter one another, bump up against one another in the ordinary course of life, because this is what teaches us to negotiate and to abide our differences.
That horse is pulling it along at one percent of the speed of sound, and the rutted dirt road turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains.
So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline.
It maxes out in the 1930s, '40s and '50s, and then it starts slowing down, and here's a cautionary note.
Now the history that we've achieved is that we've grown at 2.0 percent per year over the whole period, 1891 to 2007, and remember it's been a little bit negative since 2007.
That means we'd go from 44,000 to 180,000.
In college, we've got cost inflation in higher education that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care.
All the rest went to the top one percent.
We had the vertical city, the invention of the elevator.
And then we had the electric washing machine.
Those horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land.
And an amazing fact for techno-optimists is that in the first half of the 20th century, the rate of improvement of life expectancy was three times faster than it was in the second half of the 19th century.
It's amazing. The mainframe computer was invented in 1942.
Or you get everything invented to yesterday, including Facebook and your iPhone, but you have to give up, go out to the outhouse, and carry in the water.
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B+.
Now in the nature area, we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something, perhaps in our brains, some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect.
And I had a miniature poodle.
But actually, there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14.
And so, I had this notion of death all around me, because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.
How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?
There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.
And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here, and just say that creative people are multidimensional, and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.
And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there until things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years.
And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.
I got these hints everywhere.
And you are noticing it more often.
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know that if I went there, what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later, when the time came.
In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.
You wonder, are these things random chance?
And we walked three valleys beyond, and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous, a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story, and I cannot explain it.
And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China.
It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.
But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?
So, there are never complete answers.
Thank you very much!
And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread, no one wanted it.
At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV.
Well, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours.
And I ignored every message because I don't have a pain reliever problem.
I couldn't have written this better myself. It came out four days ago -- I circled the important parts so you can see them here.
And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff.
And "remarkable" is a really cool word because we think it just means neat, but it also means -- worth making a remark about.
Two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail -- one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box, and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them.
This guy, Lionel Poilane, the most famous baker in the world -- he died two and a half months ago, and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend.
That's what mass marketing is.
And if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve, and it'll spread.
Not because it's hard to make interesting mustard -- you can make interesting mustard -- but people don't because no one's obsessed with it, and thus no one tells their friends.
It's really simple -- you sell to the people who are listening, and maybe, just maybe those people tell their friends.
This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company, making them a fortune. It costs 35 percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about, because it's remarkable.
They're made from "cremains."
Number two: The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe.
Silk. Put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section.
And my big failure? I came out with an entire record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD format -- this remarkable new format -- and I marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos.
They don't anymore. So the founding fathers said, "We've got some money to spend.
And in Arabic, to say "no," we say "no, and a thousand times no."
And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo.
No to stripping the people, and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped and beaten on the street, and the footprint reads, "Long live a peaceful revolution," because we will never retaliate with violence.
So I come with my stencils, and I spray them on the suit, on the tank, and on the whole wall, and this is how it stands today until further notice.
Here's why.
In the cities, a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value.
All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden, and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future.
If we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn, instead of careening off a cliff.
And I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story.
But as disturbing as that is, I think the bigger problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming.
I read that last year the pup mortality rate was 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
I wanted it to be more like war photography, where I was making harder-hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to marine wildlife around the planet.
And every single day these tuna, bluefin like this, are stacked up like cordwood, just warehouse after warehouse.
And it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom, things like sponges and corals, that critical habitat for other animals.
And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible, it struck me as sort of a crucifixion, if you will.
I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary.
This is the oceanic whitetip shark, an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species, if you pay attention to such lists.
But, you know, here we see a shark that's maybe 10 or 11 inches long swimming in about a foot of water.
And today, they crawl out and see condominiums.
But, you know, thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate, and the species' future is in great danger.
They also get entangled in fishing gear.
And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population, I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales that had only been discovered about 10 years ago in the sub-Antarctic of New Zealand, a place called the Auckland Islands.
I settled on working in the country of New Zealand because New Zealand was rather progressive, and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean.
So when the fish control the urchin population, the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium.
And that's because it's been protected, that it has come back.
Of course, the cage was salvaged.
Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together, just now like victims for every baby, six have disappeared from the forest.
So I created the place Samboja Lestari, and the idea was, if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of where there is really nothing left, no one will have an excuse to say, "Yeah, but ..."
This was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife.
So basically the whole process of destruction had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm.
But we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that.
If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil, on a clay soil, on a steep slope, on flat soil, you put those different recipes; if you combine them, out of that comes a business plan, comes a work plan, and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have, and you can do it.
So we plant the trees, we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between, to reduce the competition for the trees, the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops, for the people, but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land, the system yields early income, the orangutans get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money.
May.
So these fires are really the first things to work on.
And you can create so much energy from this -- they produce three times more energy per hectare per year, because you can tap them on a daily basis.
But, it's more complicated. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people.
And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space.
That you can go from this zero situation, by planting the vegetables and the trees, or directly, the trees in the lines in that grass there, putting up the buffer zone, producing your compost, and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used.
We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people, but the trees are growing up fast in between as well.
Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon, how the forest is developing, and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation.
Now we looked at the clouds above this forest; we looked at the reforestation area, the semi-open area and the open area.
And if we look at the rainfall pattern above Samboja Lestari, it used to be the driest place, but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there.
We have the zone with the sugar palms, and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans -- that we provide with a place to live in the middle -- and the people apart.
They have enough income for three families.
They also get free land in between the trees, where they can grow their crops.
And I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water, and maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers.
Eight hundred two-liter soda bottles -- oh yea.
Transferred to a larger scale -- actually a lot larger, with a lot of help -- 14,064 bicycle reflectors -- a 20-day install.
What if every seemingly isolated object was actually just where the continuous wave of that object poked through into our world?
And for me, the path between these two extremes takes the shape of a wave.
And then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff.
And I waited, and the next day I liked it a bit better, the next day I liked it a bit better, and now I really love it.
But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities.
So, the other character is Otto, the automobile.
Curitiba, Rio: it's like two birds kissing themselves.
which is Bogota, and they did a very good job.
That's why, I'm trying to say, it's like metro-nizing the bus.
Our idea of mobility is trying to make the connections between all the systems.
I'm trying to say we have to combine all the systems, and with one condition: never -- if you have a subway, if you have surface systems, if you have any kind of system -- never compete in the same space.
I would like to say, if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what's said, but don't forget the cities and the children.
This is the Italian portal, the Ukrainian park, the Polish park, the Japanese square, the German park.
So, in a city, you have to work fast.
At the end, I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song.
And four years later, as I said, it's been seen by four ...
So, as I was saying...
I meet all kinds of people who don't think they're really good at anything.
But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else.
You have to go looking for them, they're not just lying around on the surface.
It means challenging what we take for granted, things that we think are obvious.
The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion."
But our minds are still hypnotized by them, and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them.
Now that's a great deal of us, isn't it?
My daughter never wears a watch, my daughter Kate, who's 20.
Everybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly, or sometimes explicitly, a different story: that life is not linear; it's organic.
There was this guy buying a book, he was in his 30s.
This one teacher didn't take it seriously.
This linearity thing is a problem.
But as we just heard in this last session, there's such competition now to get into kindergarten -- to get to the right kindergarten -- that people are being interviewed for it at three.
You know there are two models of quality assurance in catering.
In a way, it did not for me.
You know this, if you're doing something you love, an hour feels like five minutes.
So when we look at reforming education and transforming it, it isn't like cloning a system.
That's where children experience life.
And every day, everywhere, our children spread their dreams beneath our feet.
So my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact: that two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language.
But some verbs are irregular.
So there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War, but there's only four wars that are 100 times deadlier -- like World War I.
And so that explains this pattern that we've seen before.
It will be able to reveal new trends in our history, sometimes to explain them, and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen.
And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase.
You're much too young to help.
Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence, and 27 years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills, the incredible skills, that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy.
When do I give in?
And no one got killed.
You're the adult.
So I did the thing.
Totally ineffective.
This century there's a shift.
And what they've realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane, but it's less effective than using methods that connect people with people, that rebuild.
And Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head, pointing at the ground, and he said, "Kneel."
Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Mali, Madagascar, Poland, the Philippines, Serbia, Slovenia, I could go on, and now Tunisia and Egypt.
We're getting practical, doable methodologies to answer my question: How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug?
Thank you.
Can we all just close our eyes for a minute?
It is dimensionless. It is limitless.
This was a wonderful place, because it was a place where you could imagine that you were the first person to be there.
In fact, Chris was worried and said, "Look, don't show them that slide, because they're just going to think you're another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn't do much.
In the old days they used to take a lump of Pentelic marble and drill from the surface in order to identify the skin, the appearance, what Aristotle defined as the distinction between substance and appearance, the thing that makes things visible, but here we're working from the other side.
Dark matter now placed against a horizon.
Just moving on, is it possible, taking that idea of mind, body, body-building, to supplant the first body, the biological body, with the second, the body of architecture and the built environment.
Again, a site found with a completely flat 360-degree horizon.
You are now consciousness without an object, freed from the dimensionful and measured way in which life links us to the obligatory.
Believe me or not, I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem, with the requisite focus on climate.
I simply said, "If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead, who will lead business and industry?
And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.
I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T.
Thinking it through, I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator.
This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption -- so the scientists are telling us.
We call it Cool Carpet.
A better business model, a better way to bigger profits.
No amount of advertising, no clever marketing campaign, at any price, could have produced or created this much goodwill.
I don't think so.
We can see our way now, clear to the top of that mountain.
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here.
"Without a name, an unseen face, and knowing not your time or place, Tomorrow's child, though yet unborn, I met you first last Tuesday morn.
We are, each and every one, a part of the web of life.
For me, "Law and Order: SVU," Tine Fey and "30 Rock" and "Judge Judy" -- "The people are real, the cases are real, the rulings are final."
Moreover, we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption.
Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves, "Are we next?"
How are they entitled to practice?
This double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market, a time when anyone is a potential author.
And they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home.
But the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward, especially in industries we can't even imagine yet, just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries, which few, if any of us come have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago.
I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come.
It's by Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine composer.
And the good news is I don't have a prepared speech, but I have a box of slides.
And so for the remaining two years of my high school, I cut all my classes.
You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh?
And when you come to Pittsburgh -- and you're all invited -- you'll be flying into the blown-up version of my building.
And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility -- and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech.
He's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people.
What you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life.
We've heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers, and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building.
And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America, which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools, and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city.
Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place I call my center.
That's our dining room.
The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago -- he's now an instructor.
Well, I went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood, the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm, you can bring them right back to life.
We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging.
We have smoked salmon at the art openings, we have a formal printed invitation, and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come.
And he got 10 parents and then 20 parents.
I even stuck another room on the building, which I'd like to show you.
She said, "Yes, sir."
And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check on a Wednesday afternoon, and I said, "Dizzy, why would you come to a black-run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesn't even have a reputation in music?"
Then a bass player named Ray Brown, and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine, and a piano player named Herbie Hancock, and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra, and a fellow named Tito Puente, and a guy named Gary Burton, and Shirley Horn, and Betty Carter, and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city.
Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back.
We put the mops in the hallway and re-engineered the thing and that's where we recorded the first Grammy.
And I'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done.
Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse that's going to open in October this year because we're going to grow those flowers in the middle of the inner city.
The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and I'll tell you where I made my big mistake.
He said, "Man, that's a great story.
And he said, "As God as my witness, I've had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you've built it.
He came up to me afterwards, he said, "Man, that's a fabulous story.
He said, "Well, that's the electronic commerce network."
And in the back of the room, a woman stood up and she said, "In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place, you're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity.
And I've fallen in love with him, as I have with Herbie and with his music.
And I'm tired of living like this, going into town after town with people standing around on corners with holes where eyes used to be, their spirits damaged.
I think we can get home on this thing and I think we can build these all over the country for less money than we're spending on prisons.
It's really our first foray into this.
Here you have a retina.
So what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration? What happens is is that, the front-end cells die, the photoreceptors die, and over time, all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them, they die too.
So no other device has been able to do this.
Here are three sets of firing patterns. The top one is from a normal animal, the middle one is from a blind animal that's been treated with this encoder-transducer device, and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic.
Can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing from the responses from the firing patterns?
When this first came out, it was just a really exciting thing, the idea that you even make a blind retina respond at all.
They've been here for billions of years, and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms.
And of course it's the DNA that counts, so here's all the A, T, Gs and Cs that make up your genetic code, and give you all your charming characteristics.
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well.
What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium, a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean, named Vibrio fischeri.
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell.
The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light.
But then if you think about it, the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that.
When the molecule increases to a certain amount -- which says something about the number of cells -- it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light.
What they do, we now understand, is they get in you, they wait, they start growing, they count themselves with these little molecules, and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together, they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host.
But the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species.
So this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin.
What happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you.
I've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors, they communicate with these molecules.
We thought, well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications, just make these bacteria so they can't talk, they can't count, and they don't know to launch virulence.
To finish I'll just show you the strategy.
Of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular.
By using these two molecules they can say "me" and they can say "you."
What we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you, in the hopes of making you more healthy, making those conversations better, so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own.
It's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference.
But we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics.
Suppose we're distributing flutes.
The worst flute players.
That's Peter?
And the point, the essential nature, of musical performance is to produce excellent music.
He had a bad leg, a circulatory problem, that made it very painful for him to walk the course.
Suppose you were on the Supreme Court.
Raise your hand, and we'll try to get you a microphone.
Charlie says -- We'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply.
All right, who has an answer for Charlie?
Warren, are you a golfer?
They said, yes, walking the course is strenuous physical exercise.
And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question.
So there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion.
Then the fairness objection goes away.
There are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman, and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage.
So let's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve, elevate, the terms of political discourse in the United States, and for that matter, around the world.
Thanks. Thank you.
And I think we can do that in public life more generally.
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.
And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step, that point of maybe 30 years life extension.
And here is that characteristic.
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades.
You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about.
I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work.
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.
I'm now going to talk about feasibility.
And there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.
So then, what do we do about that?
That's the wrong answer.
We can think, really, that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.
Well, it seems to get the point across.
Alright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk, my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one; namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity?
The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?
So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone, robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.
So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice, I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.
And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.
The point about this slide is actually the bottom.
First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.
So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework, in order to understand whether this is true.
Not very long. OK.
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality, when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?
That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?
AG: There are technical implications certainly.
Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends, including President Obama.
So we decided, a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable, to found a financial services firm based on our values, and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance.
What does that mean?
We care how we make our profit.
Now that we've had all that happen, and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables, will we see business and finance change?
And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious, and they are going to start voting with their wallets, and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside, if they don't do it from the inside.
Five years later, Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president -- first female to become head of state, single mom, a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed.
The final thought I want to leave with you is that I'm fed up with this tyranny of either/or choices in life -- either it's men or it's women.
By suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requirement of automobile use, and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a gas-belching, time-wasting and life-threatening prosthetic device that many of us need just to, most Americans, in fact, need, just to live their daily lives.
Working families, which are defined as earning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars a year in America are spending more now on transportation than on housing, slightly more, because of this phenomenon called "drive till you qualify," finding homes further and further and further from the city centers and from their jobs, so that they're locked in this, two, three hours, four hours a day of commuting.
While most cities were reaming out their roads, removing parallel parking and trees in order to flow more traffic, they instituted a skinny streets program.
Actually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states, which may be a good thing or a bad thing, but it makes you glad they're driving less.
Twenty-five percent of young men and 40 percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces.
Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work, they were shocked to learn that the only difference between the subjects that they could figure out was the amount they were moving, and that in fact those who gained weight were sitting, on average, two hours more per day than those who didn't.
I may have that wrong, but you get the idea.
But in fact, here in America, 12 people out of every 100,000 die every year from car crashes.
Orlando: 20 per 100,000.
He apparently had a sense of humor.
So a fundamental shift, and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species.
My wife and I built a new house on an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C., and we did our best to clear the shelves of the sustainability store.
But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more, something that would be better than what we have right now?
And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German, like Dusseldorf or Vienna, where they're burning, again, half as much fuel.

And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.
It's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.
It's important that we build this platform, that we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying, "Look, we must do something different."
People don't have voice.
The economies were not growing.
That's engaging in the wrong debate.
Africa has been giving the other countries aid.
Is it being directed effectively?
At a certain point in time, in 1969, things were really bad.
So I was the oldest person in the house.
We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.
She gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then -- gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration -- and some other therapies, and put us in a corner.
Why am I telling that? I'm telling you that because -- when it is you or your person involved -- you don't care where -- whether it's aid.
So that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I say let's channel these resources we get into something productive.
Infrastructure everywhere.
My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain -- which is roads, highways, other things that they can build -- I say then, why do they refuse to use the same aid to build the same infrastructure in our countries?
They are just discovering.
Will we make the same mistake that we made before?
We've not called the Bill Gates, and the Soros, and everybody else who is helping and say, "Sit down. Let's have a conference with you.
I firmly believe in that private sector thing too.
Don't be shy of it.
They don't shy away from infrastructure.
But I'm saying it's not either or.
A lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it.
Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.
There was a housing collapse, an auto industry collapse, and the population had plummeted by 25 percent between 2000 and 2010, and many people were beginning to write it off, as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities.
So we began our process in September of 2010.
Many found work in the automobile industry, the Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this mural by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art.
Citywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes.
Now some of our audience members also tell us about some of the positive things that are happening in their communities, and many of them are banding together to take control of some of the vacant lots, and they're starting community gardens, which are creating a great sense of community stewardship, but they're very, very clear to tell us that this is not enough, that they want to see their neighborhoods return to the way that their grandparents had found them.
And they also knew that they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things.
So they, too, could take businesses that they maybe were doing out of their home and grow them to more prosperous industries and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the communities with which they resided.
So I am a surgeon who studies creativity, and I have never had a patient tell me that "I really want you to be creative during surgery," and so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it.
And so why don't we go and click the video.
Is it truly possible to study creativity scientifically?
And so it gets down to the brain.
Now when you're in an fMRI scanner, you're in a big magnet that's aligning your molecules in certain areas.
Charles Limb: This is a plastic MIDI piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments.
And so the experiment really rests on the following: What happens in the brain during something that's memorized and over-learned, and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated, or improvised, in a way that's matched motorically and in terms of lower-level sensory motor features?
And the musicians, they were comfortable in the end.
We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity, and I'll summarize that for you here.
And so the next question was: What happens when musicians are trading back and forth, something called "trading fours," which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment?
CL: You have to have the right attitude to agree to it.
That was challenging.
This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication.
In a lot a ways, rap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve.
Computer: Memory, thump. CL: Thump of the beat in a known repeat Rhythm and rhyme, they make me complete The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic Spittin' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strike I search for the truth in this eternal quest My passion's not fashion, you can see how I'm dressed Psychopathic words in my head appear Whisper these lyrics only I can hear The art of discovering and that which is hovering Inside the mind of those unconfined All of these words keep pouring out like rain I need a mad scientist to check my brain I guarantee you that will never happen again.
Creatively speaking, it's just a phenomenal thing.
You've got major cerebellar activity, which is involved in motor coordination.
The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.
But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics, that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.
Look, the world has changed from analog to digital.
Our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction into human-computer interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do, but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences.
There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals.
It doesn't require any scalp preparation, no conductive gel or paste.
Evan. Okay.
So the idea here now is that Evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen, and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that.
So we have a little bit of time available, so I'm going to ask Evan to do a really difficult task.
EG: Losing concentration.
So I'd like to show you a few examples, because there are many possible applications for this new interface.
In this example, facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands.
We invent for fun -- invention is a lot of fun to do -- and we also invent for profit.
It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters; it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated.
Now, the reason we were able to come up with this is two key ideas: One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar, something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in.
Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this.
That's great, except the places that have malaria really bad, they don't have health care systems.
We could spend hours going over this.
Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels, and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.
It creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things; in particular, it lets you find hemozoin.
You spend a certain amount per bed net.
That's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed.
By doing these kinds of simulations, we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life; to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs -- how many bed nets versus how much spraying? -- or the social trade-offs -- what happens if unrest breaks out?
Once upon a time, this was the primary technique, and, in fact, many countries got rid of malaria through DDT.
And, of course, there's signal processing and digital cameras.
Of course, if you do that, you could also protect your backyard.
Mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs.
And we're going to show you, instead of the kill laser, which will be a very brief, instantaneous pulse, we're going to have a green laser pointer that's going to stay on the mosquito for, actually, quite a long period of time; otherwise, you can't see it very well.
So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around.
This is one of the first ones we did.
Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world.
It's then harvested.
Basically a restaurant just like any other.
I hate waste, especially walls.
Will they outlive me? They probably might.
This is the kitchen, which is in the same room.
In here, I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable.
I don't know how many worms [were] in there, but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.
They're all English and a little bit more sustainable.
And this is an English willow air diffuser, and that's softly moving that air current through the room.
I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.
This is a social enterprise, not-for-profit cooperative supermarket.
In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching, let's have a go. Try it on.
I think it's important.
Others battle oppressive societies.
Earlier that day, I noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school.
Just for giving me his car keys, my own brother was detained twice, and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist, leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son.
Allow me to give you a briefing about my story.
It was a few weeks later, we started receiving all these "Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive."
I was in the campaign with other Saudi women and even men activists.
I was released after nine days.
I know, I was like this, I was shocked.
What's worst, when they become codified as laws in the system, and when women themselves believe in their inferiority, and they even fight those who try to question these rules.
"Manal al-Sharif withdraws from the campaign."
They even started a poll.
But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you.
The Shura Council that's appointed by the king, by royal decree of King Abdullah, last year there were 30 women assigned to that Council, like 20 percent.
I told her, "Only if women stop asking 'When?' and take action to make it now."
Thank you.
There's all these things that I've done with my life that I have no recollection of unless someone brings it up, and sometimes I think, "Oh yeah, that's something that I did."
It's difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second.
I actually ran out, I spent too much money on my road trip for the savings that I had to take my year off, so I had to, I went to Seattle and I spent some time with friends working on a really neat project.
It's not always a good day, so when you have a bad one, I think it's important to remember it, just as much as it is important to remember the [good] days.
I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.
Theo Jansen is working hard on this evolution.
This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa.
Thank you.
So, 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel, we have a new wheel. And I will show you, in the next video -- can you start it, please? -- that very heavy loads can be moved.
And it must feel the water of the sea.
So as soon it has been to the sea, it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here, and it knows always where it is on the beach. So it's very simple brain.
Now, another couple of years, and these animals will survive on their own.
And as soon as we had these two sequences we thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self-replicating species, could there be even a smaller genome?
In 2002, we started a new institute, the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives, where we set out two goals: One, to understand the impact of our technology on the environment, and how to understand the environment better, and two, to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life.
We had two teams working in parallel: one team on the chemistry, and the other on trying to be able to transplant entire chromosomes to get new cells.
I think philosophically, that was one of the most important papers that we've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was.
So in addition to doing the transplant, we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell.
And once we had done that, now we can take naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it.
There's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error, and then there's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of DNA, as we did with the watermarks, and it can tolerate all kinds of errors.
And the first chromosome we built in 2008 -- the 500,000-base pair one -- we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code, but it was using just amino acid single letter translations, which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.
So it's clearly distinguishable from any other species, having 46 names in it, its own web address.
The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we've done -- asking for ethical review, pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side -- this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community, in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government.
Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change in how we view life.
Also, at Synthetic Genomics, we've been working on major environmental issues.
Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union, this makes perfect sense to me.
Now I did have an advantage.
God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh -- jealously insisting on no other gods.
So the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself, or as Arthur Arberry called his version, "an interpretation."
"Some of these verses are definite in meaning," it says, "and others are ambiguous."
Now this may be a way of saying "pure beings" -- like in angels -- or it may be like the Greek Kouros or Kórē, an eternal youth.
It's gardens watered by running streams.
Nobody tells anybody what to do.
And every year I go there and make a map of my study site.
And this shows a recently virgin queen. Here's her wings.
Then, as soon as the ants -- the first group of ants -- emerge, they're larvae. Then they're pupae. Then they come out as adult ants.
This is about as big as they get, about a meter across.
That's not just how is the colony organized, but how does it change what it's doing?
The patrollers -- that's supposed to be a magnifying glass -- are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active.
On one day, it'll all be here, and then the next day they'll move it over there, and then they'll move it back.
The queen's in there somewhere; she just lays eggs.
But in fact, mostly they're just hanging around in there.
They have eyes, they can distinguish between light and dark, but they mostly work by smell.
So for example, I created more work for the nest maintenance workers by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance, early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active.
We started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers, and they work really well.
The patrollers become foragers.
And here was the most intriguing result: the task allocation.
And the obvious thing that's changing is its size.
The pattern itself is the message.
And we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads, and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate.
You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these.
Again, I don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork.
The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony -- and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule, like "I expect to meet another forager every three seconds."
If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me, that's what they would tell you.
Real depression isn't being sad when something in your life goes wrong.
We don't see it on the news, because it's not happy, it's not fun, it's not light.
You'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team, the drama and theater student of the year, the English student of the year, someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party.
Some people might fear sharks. Some people might fear death.
That's what keeps you from getting help.
We just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself.
It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves, where we're okay with who we are, because when we get honest, we see that we all struggle and we all suffer.
Because the world I believe in is one where embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark.
I believe that we can. Thank you guys so much.
And what's interesting about it isn't the cost; it's the way it encodes the Internet.
This was from a thesis of a student, Bill Butow, now at Intel, who wondered why, instead of making bigger and bigger chips, you don't make small chips, put them in a viscous medium, and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch.
Now, integrating chemistry in computation, where the bits are bubbles.
But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner.
So, there's no feedback to a tool metrology; the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways that protein are fabricated. So, you can, for example, do that.
But the first day of class looked like this.
Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you really have to scream, but you can't because you're at work, or you're in a classroom, or you're watching your children, or you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted?
This is a student who made a machine that makes machines, and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing.
So, I made a deal with my NSF program managers that instead of talking about it, I'd give people the tools.
You can see it in their face, just this joy of, I can do it.
: Girl: My name is Valentina Kofi; I am eight years old.
Real invention is happening in these labs.
It was very chaotic, it wasn't, sort of, clear what was going on.
So I'd like to leave you with two thoughts.
The hardest thing at this point is the social engineering and the organizational engineering, but it's here today.
We have to get off of oil purchased from the enemy.
So at that point, 1912, we selected crude oil over whale oil and some more coal.
Now if you look at the cost of OPEC, it cost seven trillion dollars -- on the Milken Institute study last year -- seven trillion dollars since 1976, is what we paid for oil from OPEC.
Raise your hand if you think you know.
Why? Why are they in the Mid-East?
The slide you're looking at here is 1990 to 2040.
We don't even realize the resources that we have available to us.
It's what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil."
It's ours, we have an abundance of it.
It will replace or be able to be used for that.
I think it's probably 175 billion barrels.
I don't have to worry about the bridge to where at my age.
If we do -- it's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil.
TBP: I lost 150 million dollars.
TBP: That's what happened.
Now I do own stocks.
Why doesn't that prospect concern you?
Where are we headed?"
TBP: I don't like that because it ends up the government is going to run the program.
And I can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be.
Is that a concern?
I don't know what in the hell he's talking about.
I don't understand why the media is focused on Eastern Pennsylvania.
And if you look at California, they use 2,500 buses.
All right, so it's the bridge fuel.
And that was a real gift you gave this audience.
For one thing, both were very real.
A few bring out 100,000 dollars each.
These are community affairs, by the way.
In the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship.
And one of the soldiers wrote home, and this is the sentence that he put: "The struggle between right and six dollars a month and wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one."
The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere account for the myriads of ravens along the road.
Husband #2: Not for another 15 minutes. After all, it's your special day.
Because when you take out that last piece of gold -- and they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush -- the entire American river region, within two years -- every stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there.
And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on is sort of the golden age of appliances.
And they're tearing up all the streets.
And the appliances, the golden age of appliances really lasted -- it depends how you want to measure it -- but it's anywhere from 40 to 60 years. It goes on a long time.
Now, not all these things were highly successful.
I want to point out one thing. This is -- you guys know what this is.
Now, this was an object of much envy and lust.
And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation, because they hadn't invented the off switch.
And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this.
And, you know, we think it's getting better, but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself?
So we're not -- we're pretty kludge-y ourselves.
And if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is 1996: "All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble."
We're very, very early. Thank you very much.
I think nature gave them a helping hand here.
So, from a biologist's point of view, compassion is actually a gene's way of helping itself. OK.
And there, the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor.
It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic.
So, that's good news. Now, if you've been paying attention, you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here; we still aren't to universal love, and it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural, it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule.
We all do that, and you see it all over the world.
Are you on the edges of your seats here?
So, what do those terms mean?
You both feel you've won.
And now I can admit that it might not too, now that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff.
You saw it with the recent economic crash, where bad things happen in the economy -- bad for everybody, for much of the world.
For example, probably a lot of American Christians don't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship with Muslims halfway around the world, but they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it, that's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten American security.
I think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships, Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on, in this regard.
Once we define somebody as an enemy, we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes, just naturally.
If you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags, it helps to understand what makes them do it.
In Oxford in the 1950s, there was a fantastic doctor, who was very unusual, named Alice Stewart.
Now, Alice had trouble getting funding for her research.
What time of life had they started school?
In fact, she need not have hurried.
So, Alice was very outgoing and sociable, and George was a recluse.
It's a fantastic model of collaboration -- thinking partners who aren't echo chambers.
Because you simply won't commit that kind of energy and time if you don't really care.
And they can't because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict.
If we aren't going to be afraid of conflict, we have to see it as thinking, and then we have to get really good at it.
But he kept worrying about it, and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved.
And his colleagues don't think of him as a crank.
But when we dare to break that silence, or when we dare to see, and we create conflict, we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking.
A little background: For 10 years I've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare -- or in some cases, non-existent.
Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London, and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there.
That's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable.
You need absolutely the right mountain if you're going to have a clock for 10,000 years.
This place is remote. It's over 200 miles from any major city.
We're in Pole Canyon, looking west up the western escarpment of Mount Washington, which is 11,600 feet on top.
In this case it might well be an image of the clock.
January 7003. There it is.
At the end of it there's something physical, a kind of reward that you take away.
Other elements were mines, weather, approaches and elevation.
We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona join us on the expedition.
Because the owner said, "There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain."
Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring.
There's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena, which is the lead-silver thing. They didn't find any.
Way more interesting than Monterey even today.
It runs on solar, and it sends a signal with that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere to a place in Bozeman, Montana, where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to San Francisco, where we put the data in real time up on our website.
So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach.
Now, as you gain elevation your IQ goes down -- but your emotional affect goes up, which is great for having a mythic experience, whether you want to or not.
And then, of course, the next thing I hear is, "I've made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here."
And it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image, and I'm not sure you can.
So here we're looking from the south, look north.
Over on the eastern side it's gentle, as you can see.
And as it turned out the answer is, yes, that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak, and that might be conjured with.
Alfalfa and cattle, run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham, and it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work.
It's only about 12 feet deep, but what if it were deepened from inside?
All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them.
I always wanted to be outside the box.
It could. It has the genetic information.
Well, this did not make sense to me.
To begin with, I came to work with this virus that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken.
Now look at that. There is that beautiful feather in the embryo.
So, here is a lovely human breast.
So you take them out, you put them in a dish, they don't make milk. They completely forget.
So, you can imagine the amount of skepticism I received -- couldn't get money, couldn't do a whole lot of other things, but I'm so glad it all worked out.
I made a radical hypothesis.
Well, it was wonderful. Boggles my mind.
And here is another five seconds of repose, is my mantra. Form and function.
And I always say to the students and post-docs I lecture to, don't be arrogant, because arrogance kills curiosity.
This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions.
And unfortunately or fortunately, chemistry won.
They are the future and I try to make them not be afraid of being the cat and being told, don't think outside the box.
So go to it!
All right, good. These are all the liars.
Now my first professional encounter with deception is a little bit later than these guys, a couple thousand years.
It sounds a little bit like a weird book, but actually they're all new types of lies.
But really, you're just bored. You want to talk to somebody else.
Here's R.J. Ellory, best-seller author in Britain.
In North America, we call this Astroturfing, and Astroturfing is very common now. There's a lot of concerns about it.
Those are the conversations that really matter.
How about Facebook itself?
And they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came, or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo.
In fact, they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch, what we say in the lab as "strong rounding up."
It's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials, hundreds of studies, and there's some really compelling findings.
Strange. The other thing is that just because you can't see me doesn't mean I'm going to lie. It's common sense, but one important finding is that we lie for a reason.
So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record. In fact, even the next big change to writing was only 500 years ago now, with the printing press, which is very recent in our past, and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II, so even the people of the last two millennia, most of the words they ever said -- poof! -- disappeared.
Well, as a social scientist, this is the most amazing thing I have ever even dreamed of. Now, I can look at all those words that used to, for millennia, disappear.
Remember, I study deception. I can tell if you don't raise your hand.
All right, so why do I care about this?
This isn't a deception-detection machine to tell if your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging.
First, lying online can be very dangerous, right?
Okay, Glass, record a video.
Woman 3: Okay, Glass, record a video!
I like to pay attention to these because that's how we originally funded the company, and it's gone pretty well.
So when we developed Glass, we thought really about, can we make something that frees your hands?
And this is now, 15 years later, sort of the first form factor that I think can deliver that vision when you're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth.
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera.
And with this, I know I will get certain messages if I really need them, but I don't have to be checking them all the time.
I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting.
And so I'd make the car stop, and I'd get out of the car and walk, and see that in fact there wasn't a hole, but it was a trick of my eye, it was a shadow, you know.
And I saw this really smart critic who I love.
I sit up at night and I watch movies and I watch women in movies a lot.
How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo?
And anybody who would turn around I would, sort of, make a beeline for.
I was dating this guy, right?
They eat out, they see shows.
And you know, I don't say that I do everything well, I just say that I do a lot of things, that's all.
I do work with different choreographers.
Maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from, puppets, right.
But I must say, this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time, that is what -- I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer.
And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing, and do another thing and talk about it, right?
Her grandmother says, "Delish!"
IM: You look so cute already, by the way.
ROD: No, but it means that your priority has to be their well-being first, I think.
Oh no, we're just staging, ROD: We're just staging it.
Right? And then I realized, that was on my website, and then it said, like, you know, the quote was attributed to me and I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview.
And so I think that's what it all boils down to.
And it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows?
IM: It's always low-fat buttermilk.
In the old days when they used to make butter, you know how you make butter?
Now, the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk.
Have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around?
So identity was primarily defined by ethnicity, and the nation-state reflected that.
And that's something which I'd like to elaborate on.
At the age of 19, I was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K.
Eventually I was detected, of course, in Egypt.
Because the Internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world.
Where does that leave democracy aspirants?
Again with the example of the far right: that we find, ironically, xenophobic nationalists are utilizing the benefits of globalization.
Incidentally, the difference between ideas and narratives: the idea is the cause that one believes in; and the narrative is the way to sell that cause -- the propaganda, if you like, of the cause.
One of the problems we're facing is, in my view, that there are no globalized, youth-led, grassroots social movements advocating for democratic culture across Muslim-majority societies.
The second, I believe, is political correctness.
And then people say, "We've tried democracy. It doesn't really work.
Statistically, they are educated, on average, above the education levels of Western society.
They've been building civilizational demand for their values on the grassroots, and we've been seeing those societies slowly transition to societies that are increasingly asking for a form of Islamism.
Whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level, rather than merely on a political level, a level above politics -- movements that are not political parties, but are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic culture.
We need to move one step beyond that now.
And we've made a start for that in Pakistan with a movement called Khudi, where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth to create genuine buy-in for the democratic culture.
And so a plan came up to video the vote.
And so we're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation is happening everywhere, and moving from one spot to another.
And finally, about 100 years ago, the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television.
And this is what changed.
Put another way, media is increasingly less just a source of information, and it is increasingly more a site of coordination, because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well.
Last May, China in the Sichuan province had a terrible earthquake, 7.9 magnitude, massive destruction in a wide area, as the Richter Scale has it.
Twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the US Geological Survey had anything up online for anybody to read.
But nine of the 10 in those first hours.
Essentially to say, "We will do anything to placate you, just please stop protesting in public."
And the Great Firewall of China is a set of observation points that assume that media is produced by professionals, it mostly comes in from the outside world, it comes in relatively sparse chunks, and it comes in relatively slowly.
Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages.
All of that is over.
It is the green lines now, that are the source of the free content, which brings me to my last story.
And many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk.
But I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me, and I'm going to take my lumps on this one."
And the choice we face, I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world, isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.
And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.
Near the summit, temperatures can be 40 degrees below zero.
CampThree is at the base of Lhotse, which is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.
And, after actually two months of preparation, we built our camps all the way up the mountain.
We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.
This is a view taken from camp three.
Everybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited, and you either have to go up or go down, make that decision very quickly.
This looks like a good chance to go for the summit.
But what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.
This is on the way toward the summit, on that 1,500-foot bridge.
The storm was so fierce that we had to lay, fully dressed, fully equipped, laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.
There were still 18 other climbers that we weren't aware of their condition.
And Rob got that message, but his answer was, "We're both listening."
It's really cold; it's 24,000 feet.
Apparently, Doug had died higher up on the mountain.
This was my medical kit.
This climber was snow blind.
It's the last stage, just like a scar.
And the thoughts of his family, his kids and his wife, generated enough energy, enough motivation in him, so that he actually got up.
This measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain.
He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point, and he's working pretty hard.
He's beginning to think about his family.
He's going to develop enough energy in that area -- after a day, a night and a day -- to actually motivate himself to get up.
So this is what I can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck during this survival epic.
They believe juniper smoke is holy.
Let me talk about India through the evolution of ideas.
These ideas have brought together something which has made India happen the way it is today.
We thought of people as a liability.
And this is very important. At the same time if you peel away the demographic dividend in India, there are actually two demographic curves.
But today, after 60 years, because of the rise of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs have become role models, and they are contributing hugely to the society.
Today we live in a country which sells eight million mobile phones a month, of which 90 percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people don't have credit history.
Again, after having lived for more than 200 years under the East India Company and under imperial rule, Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism.
But having said that, then we come to what I call as ideas in progress.
But having said that, there is an enormous desire among everybody, including the poor, to educate their children.
And that is a change in the mindset where infrastructure is now accepted.
The final thing is the notion of India as a single market -- because when you didn't think of India as a market, you didn't really bother about a single market, because it didn't really matter.
What are those ideas? One is, I think, are ideological issues.
This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce, you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised.
But most important I believe are the ideas we need to anticipate.
Therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health.
So we're saying: income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon.
It's important because you need it to solve the world's environment problems.
That is why I think all of you should be equally concerned with it as I am.
And I had this idea: what if I could, in effect, virtually embed, and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers?
One, they're infantry.
So, I'd like to show the clip of the film.
MM: The day is here. Life will change.
Soldiers: IV! Are we on fire? IV!
We've got a drive through window at Burger King now.
There they are! Right there! Fire, fire!
He served -- -- with the Marines, and I want to tell you a little, brief story.
How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation?
In the meantime, the soldiers -- we would email and IM.
Because, you know, we obviously have the advantage. I'm just kidding.
Motherfuckers!
Probably 20 dead, at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis.
I remember giving three IVs, bandaging several wounded.
Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of Baghdad.
When I said earlier, to try and tell a story from the inside out, versus the outside in -- part of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding.
Because the thing that very often is missing is, in the military what they call "hot wash."
I knew about that journal, but it was very, very private.
They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives -- the Iraqis who work on the post.
And for me, it's trying to bridge that disconnect.
And for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me, that then became my story, was -- for those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler -- it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents, where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed.
They used to throw candy to the kids.
So when I talk about a disconnect, it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier, which there obviously are. You know, these days, it's not like World War II, where there was a war front and a home front, and everybody seemed involved.
You know, obviously, like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing, but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers.
Secondly, a political theorist who's going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about.
The Economist magazine recently wrote an article covering one of the recent studies on happiness, and the title was "The Happy, the Unhappy and the Bulgarians."
But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot?
For the last 30 years, political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout, and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting.
And I'll start with what went right.
And of course, you have 1989 -- the end of Communism, the end of the Cold War.
Because first you have the 1960s and 1970s, cultural and social revolution, which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose.
The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality.
And when we talk about the Internet, yes, it's true, the Internet connected all of us, but we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to.
They could be communist, they could be liberal, they could be fascist or Islamic.
This is probably true.
It's not going to be the Big Brother watching you, it's going to be we being the Big Brother watching the political class.
But also don't forget, any unveiling is also veiling.
Thank you very much.
I mean, there's prison costs, there's police costs, there's court costs, all these things that you're spending money on to deal with these guys. What's it worth?
So we have to raise some money.
It was to work with 3,000 offenders split into three cohorts of 1,000 each.
They're going to have to care in the social program, but if this builds a track record over five or 10 years, then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product.
More troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison have spent some time in care.
There are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain, and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world.
So taking Peterborough as an example, we add case management across all of the different organizations that we're working with so they know what actually has been done with different prisoners, and at the same time they learn from the Ministry of Justice, and we learn, because we pushed for the data, what actually happens, whether they get re-arrested or not.
Actually, for creating social change, we need to bring in the expertise from all of those parties in order to make this work.
My oh my, walking by, who's the apple of my eye? Why, it's my very own Clonie. Oh, if I should stroll the hood, who knew I could look so good just talking on the phone to Clonie. We are pals, it's cool, 'cause we're not lonely, shallow gene pool is nothing to my only Clonie. Me and you, hustling through, holding on through thick and thin, just day by day, our DNA, so the Olson twins got nothing on us. We'll survive, side by side. Mother Nature, don't you call her phony, she's my Clonie. Was wealthy, but not healthy, had no one to dwell with me, so look who I got born -- Clonie. Far from broke, bored, rich folk, we don't need no natural yolk -- our babies come full-formed, Clonie. We'll be huggable, get a publicist and show them, be the most lovable thing since fucking Eminem. Oh my friend, multiply, we're a franchise, like Walt Disney or Hannibal Lecter. We can tell our cancer cells are more benign than old Phil Spector. We'll survive side by side, should have signed with Verve instead of Sony. You're my Clonie. "Oh Clonie, how I love you."
Yeah? And then a Swedish guy showed me my room.
I said, "What?" He goes, "Where is it?"
The Middle East is going crazy with the Arab Spring and revolution and all this. Are there any Lebanese here tonight?
In Lebanon, they do three. In Egypt, they do two.
Qataris, you guys do the nose to nose.
But no, guys, really, it is exciting to be here, and like I said, you guys are doing a lot culturally, you know, and it's amazing, and it helps change the image of the Middle East in the West. Like a lot of Americans don't know a lot about us, about the Middle East.
We like to laugh. We like to celebrate life.
But now apparently we can't even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane.
"[Imitating Arabic] -- Tutti Frutti!"
Billie Jean is not my lover She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son All right.
You know, I'm from Brisbane, which is a great city to live in.
Germany.
And last but not least, the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice.
It is unbelievably bad.
So it was a big idea. We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent, which is exactly what we've done.
We started right there, with absolutely nothing.
But this has a huge, huge impact on the environment.
Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this, because anyone can.
Last but not least, Bill Gates, I know you invented Windows.
So let's first talk about focused ultrasound.
So the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom.
You know all about imaging, right, ultrasound imaging.
He failed, so he then invented the gammaknife.
One of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound are movement disorders, like Parkinson's or essential tremor.
And this is his handwriting.
It's a safety boundary around the target.
And it does this burst of energy.
And you can see the points there on the graph.
Thank you.
They are dependent on others.
He's back to his normal life.
He was treated with radiation therapy, state-of-the-art radiation therapy, but it didn't help.
He returned again to his daily routine on the farm.
And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.
We heard here yesterday Quyen talking about the adverse event trait in prostate cancer.
All those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods, abdominal pressure, back pain, frequent urination.
So in conclusion, I'd like to leave you with actually four messages.
She's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga -- she loves it.
In the fashion industry, there's very little intellectual property protection.
And sometimes these are fun, right?
Because there's no copyright protection in this industry, there's a very open and creative ecology of creativity.
I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through.
The courts have said over and over again, "You don't need any more intellectual property protection."
The people on Santee Alley are not the ones who shop at Gucci.
And this, actually, is good news to trendsetters; they want trends to be set so that they can move product.
He has complained a lot about people copying him, but in one interview I read, he said it has really forced him to up his game.
When people knock it off, everybody knows because they've put that look out on the runway, and it's a coherent aesthetic.
If somebody steals a joke from Larry David, for instance, it's not as funny.
In the European Union, they went in the other direction.
She is the head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and she has told her constituency that she is going to get copyright protection for fashion designs.
Same with automobiles.
Tattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool.
But you know what? It's revolutionary, and it's a model that a lot of other industries -- like the ones we just saw with the really small bars -- they might have to think about this.
Then no, it does not deserve protection.
It is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds.
And I really want to thank Veronica Jauriqui for making this very fashionable presentation.
And I'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale.
And -- perhaps naively -- I was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences that deals with this idea of global species longevity.
It was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet.
So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo, but I do know the fungus is down there.
That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it, though luckily, they lost interest before killing it.
This is a clonal tree as well.
Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is -- any guesses?
And now down to another part of the world.
And this can create great natural shelters for animals, but they've also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses, including a bar, a prison and even a toilet inside of a tree.
So his thought was that flooding in the north of Africa actually brought those coniferous trees down tens of thousands of years ago, and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation to this unique desert environment.
This is the clonal Creosote bush, which is around 12,000 years old.
In fact, this land is designated for recreational all-terrain vehicle use.
The blue flags represent things that I've already photographed, and the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to.
To understand the world that live in, we tell stories.
So, every Popcorn production begins with the video, and so I've made a short, 20-second clip using a newscaster template that we use in workshops.
Let's go to this Google Map, and I'll show you how you can edit it.
If you come and watch this a week from now, this will be completely different, dynamic, just like the web, and just like the web, everything is sourced, so click your link, and you go straight to Flickr and see the source image.
I've been a street police officer, an undercover investigator, a counter-terrorism strategist, and I've worked in more than 70 countries around the world.
Twenty years later, criminals are still using mobile phones, but they're also building their own mobile phone networks, like this one, which has been deployed in all 31 states of Mexico by the narcos.
Consider the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai.
They had satellite phones, and they even had night vision goggles.
At one point during the 60-hour siege, the terrorists were going room to room trying to find additional victims.
He was not a schoolteacher.
During this 60-hour siege on Mumbai, 10 men armed not just with weapons, but with technology, were able to bring a city of 20 million people to a standstill.
You see, you can now commit more crime as well.
Of course, it's not just about stealing things.
Recently, the FBI arrested an al Qaeda affiliate in the United States, who was planning on using these remote-controlled drone aircraft to fly C4 explosives into government buildings in the United States.
The UK I know has some very strict firearms laws.
Terrorists understand this. Hackers understand this.
But if you don't need it, and somebody else gives you the shock, it's not a good thing.
For example, I predict that we will move away from a plant-based narcotics world to a synthetic one. Why do you need the plants anymore?
It will be easy for anybody to go ahead and print their own bio-virus, enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax, weaponized flu.
What to do? What to do about all this?
It's nation-based, while the threat is international.
Or what if we sent it out to a few thousand?
Whether or not you realize it, we are at the dawn of a technological arms race, an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill.
It doesn't scale, it doesn't work globally, and it surely doesn't work virtually.
They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.
And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older -- and I'm glad I waited -- -- and has no children, I look at these young people and I say, "Your job is not to be perfect.
But the real question is, what is the cost of not daring?
And whenever we would gather the fellows after that, we would leave a chair empty for her spirit.
And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage, her hands at her side, and she talked about the reunion of the 30 after the war and how extraordinary it was.
In 1986, I moved to Rwanda, and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women to start that country's first microfinance bank.
And so in a gathering where we're focused on women, while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them, we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered, unable to provide.
And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men.
My own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive.
And my dream is we'll have a world one day where we don't just honor those who take money and make more money from it, but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways.
And he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital, but he continued to pay a price.
He said, "Long story.
I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles, who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States.
And he said, "Well, what are you praying?"
And he said, "But right before the harvest, it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came."
Thank you.
Let's find out.
So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700, and looked for male portraits.
And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill.
And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces, remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows, the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin.
Yes, it does. He was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made.
It's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first.
Isn't she fabulous?
And it will be some months beforeward, and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wiggles, to rolling over, and sitting up, and crawling, standing, walking, before we get to that magical point in which we can motate in the world.
And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development.
Because what we've done in our personal evolutions is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities that are specific to our own individual histories.
From these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain.
And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized -- specialized for that complex array, a repertoire of sounds.
Now in this early period of plasticity the brain actually changes outside of a learning context.
It's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior.
So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all.
And we see that it's distorted.
In other words there is still a single, simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body.
They are all remodeled. They all become specialized for the task at hand.
The changes are massive.
Now, one of the characteristics of this change process is that information is always related to other inputs or information that is occurring in immediate time, in context.
This is a marvelously constructed thing that results in individual form because each one of us has vastly different histories, and vastly different experiences, that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self, of personhood.
It's a signal-to-noise problem. Okay?
We don't hear about that anymore. Where did it go?
It's crap.
It's not English. It's noisy English.
If you don't have a brain representation of word sounds that translation makes no sense.
So here we're looking at the normal distribution.
Think of the children on the slow side of the class.
Noise is increasing in the brain.
That means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution, and I'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities, the average person has moved to the middle or the right side of the distribution.
Get ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future, just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period.
So what I did, I'd gone back to my early marriage days.
She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads], but myself and my sisters, if they start using that, we have to cut our family milk budget.
I must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad?
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti.
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them.
My God, it's unbelievable.
Then I spend another four years to create my own machine tools, a simple machine tool like this.
That's why I am giving this machine only in rural India, for rural women, because in India, [you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women are using sanitary pads. The rest, they're using a rag cloth, a leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads.
Why not make myself a low-cost napkin?
I'm going to make India [into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime.
That's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad.
Today I want to talk to you about swimming across the North Pole, across the most northern place in the whole world.
Every holiday I had as a young boy was in a national park.
And it was so beautiful that I've been back there ever since, for the last seven years.
So I decided to do this symbolic swim at the top of the world, in a place which should be frozen over, but which now is rapidly unfreezing.
It's fucking freezing.
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end.
So we stopped the ship, as you do.
And I remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock, because my fingers had swollen so much that they were like sausages.
And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy with my father, was just going out the window.
And his hands were so badly frostbitten that he had to return to England.
I've known you, and I know, Lewis, deep down, right deep down here, that you are going to make this swim.
There were open patches of sea everywhere.
And so I now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice.
Ooh. In a couple of hours' time I'm going to get in here and do my swim.
Against the current! You did it against the current!
The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks.
Four or five children sitting behind a desk, and even in those poorest conditions, they all have a very, very good grasp of climate change.
I'll try to spin a story about energy, and oil's a convenient starting place.
Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is.
Now, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about: For the last 25 years, oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems.
Well, a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear, for starters.
What is the future of truly sustainable, carbon-free energy?
You wouldn't build a building out of this stuff, and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this.
But it's not the same stuff; it's different.
And I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk.
It's ideas, it's innovation, it's technology that will end the age of oil, long before we run out of oil.
And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.
And why did I do that?
So, I thought okay, now, what is it going to take to make this work?
I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic, which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self-revelation.
And I thought it was worth a chance, he thought it was worth a chance, and so we got up on the stage, and we had an hour conversation about his life, and after that a woman rushed up to me, essentially did, and she said, "Where did you train as a doctor?"
Some of them were very brilliant, some of them were, you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals, but it was never about that.
And, in fact, he did wind up opening up -- by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.
Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest, because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them, and they sit there and they say, "Aw, shucks, it was an accident."
But it comes down, in the end, to how do you get through all the barriers we have.
It'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you.
We never talk before that because if you talk before, you don't get it on the stage.
And I began to wonder what was going on, and you think while you talk, and basically, I thought, I got it.
Just withering in her contempt.
We all knew that.
I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago.
Now, these are arm wrestle questions, but I want to tell you about questions that are more related to empathy and that really, very often, are the questions that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked.
And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him, and he said, "Well ..." -- I'm going to do a bad southern accent.
She was the New Englander and abrasive, and he was this courtly fellow.
"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes, and then we'll decide whether we proceed."
I thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series.
And she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face, and how she could no longer count on her beauty, and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given.
Thank you very much.
You see it and you go, "Oh, my God. I'd buy that in a second!"
This is what we want.
We killed thousands of Post-it notes.
But it felt like a booby prize.
Michael Free at PATH says you have to figure out who will "choose, use and pay the dues" for a product like this.
So it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution.
So this is another one of these mind-boggling global problems.
So I went to MIT, Okay, we'll figure that out.
But without training, without some kind of light meter, how would you know?
Except, what we've learned is that there's no such thing as a dumb user -- really is what we've learned.
They've treated 50,000 kids in Vietnam with this technology.
And here's what we developed.
If you try to put more than one kid in, you're stacking them on top of each other.
I had a laptop in the Peace Corps, and the screen had all these dead pixels on it.
I have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device.
I've since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world, you have to design outcomes.
I used to work as the director of the World Bank office in Nairobi for East Africa.
And we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits: It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there, nobody was interested in irrigation projects.
We are not talking about 50,000 dollars here, or 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there.
It was even tax-deductible.
Many of the German companies, for instance, believe that they are really producing a high-quality product at a good price, so they are very competitive.
And President von Weizsäcker, by the way, chaired one of the sessions, the first one, to take the fear away from the entrepreneurs, who were not used to deal with non-governmental organizations.
And this is, in my opinion, an example of soft power, because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us.
Why? Because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of Great Britain.
I believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption, one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance.
They have to have a much more transparent financial governance.
When I'm walking around an art gallery, rooms and rooms full of paintings, after about 15 or 20 minutes, I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.
I feel guilty and unhappy with myself, rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting, I think there's something wrong with me.
Well I'm trying to take a different approach.
So I now have this sort of restaurant menu visiting of art galleries.
So that keeps me coming back.
I can do whatever I want, I can come up with whatever story I want to.
So it's not his daughter, but it's somebody close to him, physically close to him.
Well, he compartmentalizes his life.
So those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they?
She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.
He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant, saying, "Look at me. I want to warn you about what you're about to go through. Please look at me."
Now, in the National Portrait Gallery, if you don't know the biography of the painting, it's kind of useless to you.
The third thing that made me stop in my tracks is his absolutely gorgeous doublet.
You put all those together, and you've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.
I have always flushed easily, from physical exertion, from wine, from high emotion.
I know, I could barely utter them.
George did not speak.
And it's an African story.
And it's expanding.
Even though I left when I was only three years old, I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life.
I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University.
And he had nine days to make it.
Milverton Nwokedi: You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here.
I believe in the power of audiovisuals.
Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa.
But we can do something too.
He influences you really good, you know.
And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor, without doing crime, without cheating nobody, without telling no lies.
Kevin Books Ikeduba: What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face.
R So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here, with or without any assistance from anybody.
And I think they're breathing.
We didn't have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers.
And I think this is really the theme of this session.
I would like you to hear their voices.
We have diverse cultures, diverse cultures, there are so many, that in the natal lifetimes, I don't see us exhausting the stories we have.
There is scientific data on this.
FS: Oh yes, of course. This is very important.
They started in '92, '94.
I've always known that the age of design is upon us, almost like a rapture.
And in fact, interaction design is what I've been trying to insert in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art for a few years, starting not very timidly but just pointedly with works, for instance, by Martin Wattenberg -- the way a machine plays chess with itself, that you see here, or Lisa Strausfeld and her partners, the Sugar interface for One Laptop Per Child, Toshio Iwai's Tenori-On musical instruments, and Philip Worthington's Shadow Monsters, and John Maeda's Reactive Books, and also Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar's I Want You To Want Me.
I love them. So we are in the right quadrant.
We were talking about the rapture? It's coming.
And that was fantastic. And I thought that was it.
The International Cat Video Film Festival didn't have that much of a reaction.
And you know, the amount of work -- yeah, Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government and that's how he developed Tetris, and Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube that makes it look slightly bombed.
They were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation.
You know, with your mitt you can actually paw the MetroCard, and I talk about how bad ATM machines usually are.
And it was one of the first video games in which you could choose your own music.
So you start seeing here that the aesthetics that are so important to a museum collection like MoMA's are kept alive also by the selection of these games.
So it's very interesting.
It's like, it's about serenity and it's about sublime.
They also preserve artifacts for posterity.
You know, I feel that the best video games are the ones that have really savvy architects that are behind them, and if they're not architects, bona fide trained in architecture, they have that feeling.
In a way, you can see how video games are the purest aspect of interaction design and are very useful to explain what interaction is.
By getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts and everything else that we might remember from our childhood, I want people to understand that those are important forms of design.
And what I say to people, it's almost as if a butterfly were flying by and we captured the shadow on the wall, and just we're showing the shadow.
And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that I do just very straight stuff.
This is in Venice.
The garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down, finally, and several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that we've created, this campus.
I couldn't deal with the success of furniture -- I wasn't secure enough as an architect -- and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like.
And so I started making these funny things.
And the client said, "Why no fish?"
And I put them together, and you walk between them.
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales.
And, finally, Jay dragged me to my hometown, Toronto, Canada.
I play with funny people like [Claes] Oldenburg.
The highlight of the performance was at the end.
And I'm fascinated with that, which, like the paper furniture -- it's one of those materials.
But we were trying to collide our ideas, to put objects next to each other.
It made my building look sick.
And it was all of one material, and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls.
I mean, it's kind of a trite thing to say, but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be, where the people would come and where the people working would interact.
And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman.
I don't want the tower."
In Boston, we had that old building on the left.
But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me.
This is a small house somewhere.
It's kind of like a whole built town.
Etc. etc.
In this case we learned how to detail it.
Sohio is on the axis here, and we followed the axis, and they're two kind of goalposts.
So, the centerline of this thing -- we'd preserve it, and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox, etc., that are underway.
The dome was a request from the client.
These aren't focused very well.
And then you enter into the living room and then so on.
But the idea is, the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside.
And then this thing here -- I'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it.
The Minister of Finance -- the guy that moved from the Louvre -- goes in here.
I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it?
And it faces into a park.
It's like a drug addict.
I think I'm from Mars for them, and they are for me, but somehow we all manage to work together, and I think, productively.
In Switzerland -- Germany, actually -- on the Rhine across from Basel, we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum.
It's actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff.
And it's not a great building, but I approached it optimistically, that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us.
You have to then try and get that back in some way.
And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room.
And so it will be quite a different shape.
And I was asked to do a fish, and so I did a snake.
We showed this to the hotel people the other day, and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the Ritz-Carlton anymore, because of this fish.
It didn't work.
This woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she can't breathe and eat.
Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing.
In other words, he looks entirely normal.
And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them.
We're trying to struggle to find our identity.
That's exactly what people used to say to Sue.
Is this change, though, a real change, or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves?
So this is a photograph of Henry, two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone, his upper jaw, his eye-socket.
This was something more than that. He ignored it.
He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah.
They don't feel different.
They're people who have their face shot off.
So it's not simply a Western phenomenon.
So we've talked about the static face and judging the static face, but actually, we're more comfortable with judging the moving face.
The truth is that there's a five-minute rule, not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule.
This is a horrific image, so I'm putting my hand up now.
We then put bone and tissue from the back.
We can replace the underlying skeletal structure, but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin.
So there are going to be problems with face transplantation.
We're still not reconstructing them well enough.
I'm the Director of Nutrition Services for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees and 17 locations, 9,600 kids.
And I'll tell you why we need to change it, but we absolutely have to change it.
We now live in a country where most of us don't decide, by and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont, who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.
We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.
We have things like E. coli that we can't fix, that we can't make kids better when they get sick.
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.
And we spend 35,000 dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison, and school districts spend 500 dollars a year feeding a child.
What's going to happen is, we're going to have kids that have a life less long than our own.
But oops, maybe they're responsible for what kids eat.
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps and 99-cent double burgers?
The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can, it came frozen in a box.
But whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart, a giraffe, a star?
There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush.
We can't keep serving kids processed crap, full of chemicals, and expect these are going to be healthy citizens.
So this is a typical menu.
This is available on my website in English and Spanish, and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food.
You know, we have to change it.
Because, you know what, many of us are sort of at the end of our careers, and we need to be giving these kids -- these young kids, the next generation -- the tools to save themselves and save the planet.
So, public and private partnerships, advocacy groups, working with foundations.
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch.
We have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again, because, of course, they don't -- because we've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long.
Okay, Finance 101 on this, and this -- I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece, because I think this is something we all have to understand.
So you know what, when we talk about needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot.
The richest country.
And on the macro level, we're in what seems to be a 19-month presidential campaign, and of all the things we're asking all of these potential leaders, what about asking for the health of our children?
That's part of you up there.
I've learned to respect the lightning.
Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon.
But all of these attempts have one thing in common.
I mean, it basically -- I haven't really thought of it.
And these red dots show the most congested parts, which are the bridges that lead into the inner city.
If you can reduce traffic even somewhat, then congestion will go down much faster than you might think.
Well, the thing is that, the congestion charges, they were introduced first as a trial, so they were introduced in January and then abolished again at the end of July, followed by a referendum, and then they were reintroduced again in 2007, which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity.
Now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know, but I would say that the most surprising slide here I'm going to show you today is not this one. It's this one.
Well, so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services, and tried to figure out who changed, and where did they go?
And after analyzing the answers, it turned out that more than half of them believe that they haven't changed their minds.
A land where every field hides a grave, where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century.
I was alone on foot.
The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears, and welcomed as a gift.
What do we know about the death threats by the Taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh?
I had been blogging under the name Patient Dave, and when I discovered this, I just renamed myself e-Patient Dave.
Now I'm going to step back in history.
Yeah, the wavy hair, the blue eyes -- it was really something.
Well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease, the key thing that holds us back is access to information.
I was at the office; my desk was clean; I had the blue partition carpet on the walls.
This is the advice your doctor gives you: "just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife."
She's a veterinarian, so she's seen lots of ultrasounds.
Now I've been Googling -- I've been online since 1989 on CompuServe.
How does that happen?
I was slowly losing weight, but for me, that was what the doctor told me to do.
And what I read was that my median survival was 24 weeks.
Well, my doctor prescribed a patient community, Acor.org, a network of cancer patients, of all amazing things.
Here we are, four years later: you can't find a website that gives patients that information.
And the story of how all that happens is in this book.
The punch line is that a year and a half later, I was there when this magnificent young woman, my daughter, got married.
She then, last year, painted this diagram.
And it goes like this.
And then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth, where you can fly to any address.
RA patients, as they call themselves -- her blog is RA Warrior -- have a big problem because 40 percent of them have no visible symptoms.
She pulled up the CD.
And he got them chanting by the end of the talk, "Raw data now.
I collaborate with bacteria.
So seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane-filtration technology.
And Singapore proposes by 2060 to produce [900] million liters per day of desalinated water.
The first thing I'm going to tell you about this mammal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly.
So I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals.
Now, what I mean by echolocation -- they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose. This sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment, and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image.
So again, if you just look at this bat, you realize sound is very important for its survival.
However, I also think it's got to do with the fact that bats come out at night, and we don't really understand them. We're a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us.
So, wealth -- how can a bat possibly bring us wealth?
by their attraction to wind farms. Again, right now bats are looking at a little bit of a problem.
Your genome is made up of your DNA, your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function and interact and be as you are.
Evolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation.
Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired, and 45 million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem, and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases, so we want to try and better understand which mutations in the gene cause the disease.
Well, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered one of the most familiar, yet the least well-understood, aspects of all of biology, and really, since the dawn of civilization, mankind has sought to avoid it.
This bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest-living bat.
So right now, in my lab, we're combining state-of-the-art bat field biology, going out and catching the long-lived bats, with the most up-to-date, modern molecular technology to understand better what it is that they do to stop aging as we do.
Well, the thesis of "The Bottom Billion" is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years, and hence diverging from the rest of mankind.
That's the alliance that changes the world.
It wasn't just compassion for Europe, though there was that.
After the war, you opened your markets to Europe, you dragged Europe into the then-global economy, which was your economy, and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
After the war, you found the United Nations, you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, you found the IMF, you encouraged Europe to create the European Community -- all systems for mutual government support.
The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion.
The question is, how is it going to help their development?
So GDP goes up a lot -- fantastic! That's the short run.
You go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term.
So, there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term, and below which you go down.
Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy: there's electoral competition, which determines how you acquire power, and there are checks and balances, which determine how you use power.
It's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment, how they've been sold over the last 40 years?
If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10, think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like.
I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies, politicians will get away with gestures.
Please, become ambassadors.
Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation.
This is the real thing. There's no blood.
Surgeons are trained one step at a time.
Now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the American Board of Surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified.
We can't travel everywhere.
But for this examination, which is really hard, we have a problem.
We need to employ technology to assist us in this quest.
Here in the United States we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world.
It's a big task.
This is research -- can't buy it.
And I'd like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful.
So we're going to take it one step further; we've brought my friend Allan back.
SS: So that's what we're working on in our quest for the universal translator.
This story is about taking imagination seriously.
I had to do something.
I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns.
For two years, I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays, salt, air, pollution, and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind.
There was no language to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce.
I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world.
So I contacted NOAA, and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami, and translated it into this.
This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers.
Thank you.
And after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes, it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed.
So whenever I fill up my gas, I think of that liter, and how much carbon.
And I would like to say that, on the other side of it, 30, 40 years from now, the children that I have, I can look at them and say, "We did everything we possibly, humanly could do, to begin to mitigate this, what I feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time. Thank you.
You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.
Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms, that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.
But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time, it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.
When they control their brain, they can control their pain.
Where will we take it?
It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be.
Even if you get your values from religion, even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death -- either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell -- you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.
There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish, whether or not we understand these truths.
So, what I'm arguing is that value's reduced to facts -- to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings.
But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.
Is there any doubt that this question has an answer, and that it matters?
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.
And yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.
I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil -- women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.
Probably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance.
Well, one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality -- especially secular, academic, scientist types.
On the left you have Edward Witten.
I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.
How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being?
And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.
Sam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence, watching the clock ticking, but the question is: What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations, and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself?
So, everything is not going to be up for grabs.
But again, then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context.
And then I moved to the world of plant protection -- plant protection from insects, from bad bugs.
Just open it.
And what is the natural enemy, the biologically controlled agent, or the good bug, that we are talking about?
But here comes nature that provides us with a good spider.
By the way, with aphids you have only females, like Amazons.
Here we are not talking about a predator.
This is all natural. This is all natural.
This female can live only three to four days, and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs.
This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults.
Everything is just fine under these circumstances.
There are no GMOs -- Genetically Modified Organisms -- whatsoever.
And we can produce from this, believe you me, several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis.
And Israeli strawberries, even more -- 80 percent of the pesticides, especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries.
It's the same, and it can happen very quickly.
Have a look at the gap.
Secondly, to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce.
But about three years ago I had an art show in New York, and I titled it "Serious Nonsense."
My work is so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it.
This is the '58 Bulgemobile: so new, they make tomorrow look like yesterday.
The auto-gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter, but it should have -- it wasn't a big success.
Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion -- so I think that's a case for serious play.
And they had a canary hung inside the thing to make sure the Germans weren't going to use gas.
Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit, just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did -- a brochure again -- "RMS Tyrannic: The Biggest Thing in All the World."
Urban absurdism -- that's what the New Yorker really calls for.
This is the word side of my brain.
This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass. One letter makes an idea.
It's the ascent of man using an escalator, and it's in three parts.
I'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well.
They were both only children who chose not to have kids.
It might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition.
It starts with a plan.
And who's going to make sure your plan is followed?
Have advocates keep a set in their car.
In my experience, you'll want to hear that whatever you're worried about is going to be fine.

This is a European society with literate records, so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.
What about a society today?
So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies.
It turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors -- some, rather subtle ones -- that were working against the Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra, latitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the Pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central Asia.
One blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely, is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run.
And my answer is, the most important thing we need to do is to forget about there being any single thing that is the most important thing we need to do.
In particular, what can all of us do? For those of you who are interested in these choices, there are lots of things you can do. There's a lot that we don't understand, and that we need to understand. And there's a lot that we already do understand, but aren't doing, and that we need to be doing. Thank you.
And here you see just a selection.
It's a number -- very large -- a contribution to the economy of the United States for free.
They control pests, and they're food for animals.
And they prepare it in a wonderful way.
What are you eating?
So anything is a good protein source already.
So it's a very precious thing that we're using to dye our foods.
And meat, in fact, is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production.
And of course, we are not there to say that's only for us, it's not for them.
That means that pigs also share diseases with us.
With 10 kilograms of input, you can get either one or nine kg. of output.
Furthermore, per kilogram of manure, you have much, much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure.
I can go on, and I could make many more points for insects, but time doesn't allow this.
And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects, so we are just a minority -- in a country like the U.K., the USA, the Netherlands, anywhere.
There are a few people who don't like shrimp, but shrimp, or crabs, or crayfish, are very closely related.
If we die out, the insects will continue very happily.
So there's even a lot of design to it.
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects, because it's just a normal way of doing.
Allison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it?
Sure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty.
I finally went to the doctor, which was free.
You know, it's such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs.
We do not think that way.
So by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt, because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign.
Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop.
Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away, and a big fat prescription for Percocet.
And to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple, a very common, an everyday question.
But, at the time, in the 13th century, it was the gadget of the day.
And in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea.
And the altitude corresponds to the plate system.
And you can see the different components.
And this one, this is a replica from a 15th-century device.
Second, is you measure the altitude of Deneb.
So, it is, in a sense, holding a model of the universe in my hands.
He would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.
It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types.
Astrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time.
Well, I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were, our forebears were, years and years ago.
Well, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world.
So, you know H.G. Wells' "War of the Worlds," novel and movie.
We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion.
So we have two prototypes.
It stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System.
You probably haven't seen anything like this out there.
It affects the diameter and then can turn to the left, turn to the right.
Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot, and then with the winch it can climb up these kinds of thing.
So, it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things.
Or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward. It's called ChIMERA.
Instead of using electrical motors, electromechanical actuators, we're using compressed air.
It's a 12 degrees of freedom robotic arm.
As you know, we are very interested in humanoid robot, human walking, so we decided to build a small humanoid robot.
It stands up, it walks -- very impressive.
I don't know how many of you have heard about RoboCup.
The robots track and they team play amongst themselves.
I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion, martial art movements."
We also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind.
And they assemble, and they form these kinds of mechanisms.
I directly run to my home office, sit at my computer, I type in the ideas, I sketch things out and I keep a database of ideas.
This is important, because many times students, they fear or they feel uncomfortable how others might think about their opinions and thoughts.
If you want to go beyond a tinkering, if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research we need more than that. This is where school comes in.
So, I always tell my students, "Work smart, then work hard."
So this is Bertie County, North Carolina, USA.
We know the symptoms.
It is the poorest county in the state.
You can count the number of restaurants in the county on one hand -- Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite.
In fact, two years ago, only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders were passing the state standard in both English and math.
Specifically, we use these six design directives, probably the most important being number two: we design with, not for -- in that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design, it's not about designing for clients anymore.
We had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we're able to do in a rural place like Bertie County, that, as designers and builders, you can't do everywhere.
But beyond that, we recognized that Bertie County, as a community, was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking.
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs.
And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams, one team on each side of the playground, and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires.
This is the most complex.
It asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community's development.
It's working-class; it's blue-collar.
And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job.
So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way.
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that's a homework assignment.
And let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves.
Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert, and this happens only when we create too much bare ground.
Generally, what you see in green is not desertifying, and what you see in brown is, and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth.
Carbon goes back to the atmosphere.
We were once just as certain that the world was flat.
And it got worse, not better.
Clearly, we have never understood what is causing desertification, which has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally.
Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators is to get into herds, and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.
And we are burning in Africa, every single year, more than one billion hectares of grasslands, and almost nobody is talking about it.
So let's do that.
Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals, and humans, over thousands of years, had never been able to deal with nature's complexity.
Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended, and we have 150,000 people on almost permanent food aid.
This was another site where it had been bare and eroding, and at the base of the marked small tree, we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay?
We now have in the violent Horn of Africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture.
Thank you.
It's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that.
So, her caretakers took her to the village medicine man, and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital, the person decided to burn her abdomen with red-hot iron bars to drive out the demons.
Scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods -- that if the brain is older than four or five years of age, it loses its ability to learn -- that doesn't sit well with me, because I don't think that idea has been tested adequately.
Prakash, as many of you know, is the Sanskrit word for light, and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children, we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience.
So, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital.
Here's the eye with the opaque lens, the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted.
So when we started finding these results, as you might imagine, it created quite a bit of stir in the scientific and the popular press.
And we try to do this for as long as possible.
His visual-motor coordination is quite poor, but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out.
Doctor: What are their shapes?
Doctor: Now?
So the inference we are deriving from this, and several such experiments, is that dynamic information processing, or motion processing, serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing; it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition.
The way we test Dylan is by giving it inputs, as I said, of the same kind that a baby, or a child in Project Prakash would get.
Here's what a baby-cam video looks like.
When we saw that, we asked: Could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath, of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?
The efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism.
Sheryl Shade: Hi, Aimee. Aimee Mullins: Hi.
SS: When Aimee got there, she decided that she's, kind of, curious about track and field, so she decided to call someone and start asking about it.
So, I booked myself a flight to Boston in '95, 19 years old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before.
We all saw how hard you were working."
And he said, "Well, we should meet first, before we decide anything."
And I said, "No, come on."
And putting on my Georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that, you know, in order to become better -- and I'm already the best in the country -- you know, you have to train with people who are inherently better than you.
And if it came off at 85 there's no way I'm going 200 meters.
AM: No, a year.
I had just done the long jump, and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says, "How do you do that? You know, we're supposed to have a planar foot, so we can't get off on the springboard."
I was the guinea pig., I'm telling you, this was, like -- talk about a tourist attraction.
And my fastest time, which was the world record, was 15.77.
Here we are, like, crème de la crème, and there is no doubt about it, that I'm going to lose big.
And I had to think, "Why did I do this?"
So, I apply this sort of philosophy now to everything I do: sitting back and realizing the progression, how far you've come at this day to this goal, you know.
There are hair follicles on them, and I can paint my toenails.
He didn't find it as humorous as I did, anyway.
SS: In these.
So when I stand in these legs, my hamstring and my glutes are contracted, as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet.
SS: Can you tell about who designed your other legs?
And, I mean, it's really -- let me take this off so you can see it.
And she came into town and she rushed around and she said, "I have to buy some new shoes!"
They didn't even want to go there.
And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate.
But identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math.
50 billion dollars of it a year, which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone, that could stretch from here to Neanderthal times.
It's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated.
So that's it for now.
And teachers are also frustrated.
It's actually very popular.
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?
What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here?
Did it answer the question?
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.
It's a means to an end, not an end in itself, and automation allows us to have that machinery.
People say, "Is such and such true?"
That's absolutely the right thing, for people to follow their self-interest.
Are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it, or design it for that matter?
People confuse, in my view, the order of the invention of the tools with the order in which they should use them for teaching.
That somehow, if you use a computer, it's all mindless button-pushing, but if you do it by hand, it's all intellectual.
This is just nuts.
They've got hair all over them.
But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world.
And we open up so many more possibilities.
Why is this?
Very simple example.
How many years of protection do I need?
And let's understand: this is not an incremental sort of change.
So, stepping down out of the bus, I headed back to the corner to head west en route to a braille training session.
Now I was getting a little anxious.
So let me step back and set the stage a little bit.
So although I had every reason to be fearful of what was ahead, and had no clue quite what was going to happen, I was alive.
But what I didn't anticipate through that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time.
Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses, things that you would otherwise maybe ignore.
When you're sighted, everybody kind of sticks to themselves, you mind your own business.
But one time I was in Oakland walking along Broadway, and came to a corner.
It's a perfectly great city.
I tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity, out of our togetherness, and I think it's pretty cool.
It's too late then.
Blind people want to work too.
And I see my life as a series of experiments.
And, more than that, whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth.
Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.
I do think it's the defining issue of our time, or one of the main ones.
A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible, where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, "The Lord is all that," as opposed to what I knew it as, "The Lord is my shepherd."
As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.
So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard.
So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate, you visit sick people in the hospital, and you will become more compassionate.
It happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing, so sandals and sort of a white robe, you know, because again, the outer affects the inner.
So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.
The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.
And these are the ultimate literalists.
Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.
So, if anyone wants to join, the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God, there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness, and that our rituals can be sacred.
After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch, he's like, "I gotta go."
So, this was very inspiring to me.
And they would say, "Well, what about you?
The key is to pick and choose the right parts.
There's me reading the Bible.
It's like the land and the king they're inseparable, they are one.
And, of course, graphics: Today 84 dollars and 97 cents at Best Buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago.
It's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well.
And that means input and output are in the same space enabling stuff like this.
So you've got an interface that has no interface.
That's 8 a.m. shadows.
Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission? And so forth.
So this led full circle, in a strange way, to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface: the Spatial Operating Environment, we call it.
So navigation is a fundamental issue.
And then if it's time for analysis, we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution.
Here's a logistics system, a small piece of one that we're currently building.
One thing that three-dimensional interactions and the general idea of imbuing computation with space affords you is a final destruction of that unfortunate one-to-one pairing between human beings and computers.
So I'm going to leave that over there because I have a question for Paul.
And again, that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space.
We may need more than one.
We can't have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start.
We won't have succeeded unless we take that next big step.
So, in your mind, five years time, someone can buy this as part of a standard computer interface?
C'mon, c'mon. Martial arts, games. C'mon.
And Okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on.
And that, that maneuver called "crisis mapping," was kicked off in Kenya in January of 2008.
And the interesting moment now, the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true.
The media landscape in the 20th century was very good at helping people consume, and we got, as a result, very good at consuming.
LOLcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions.
The gap is between doing anything and doing nothing.
This is a graph from a paper by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini, who set out to test, at the beginning of this decade, what they called "deterrence theory."
So they divided the daycare centers into two groups.
By adding a fine, what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of 10 shekels, and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers.
The culture that got broken by the fine stayed broken when the fine was removed.
Communal value on the networks we have is everywhere -- every time you see a large aggregate of shared, publicly available data, whether it's photos on Flickr or videos on Youtube or whatever.
That will be true year-in and year-out.
And to the degree we're going to do that, to the degree we're able to do that, we'll be able to change society.
But it wasn't always like that.
There were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days, so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained, so they all sat around making friends with each other.
You could play it on the banks of the Ganges -- that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.
There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.
And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.
Thank God for them.
India, the world champions.
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do.
Now, suddenly we had to support city leagues.
This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar.
And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it.
And all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world.
And I just thought to myself, "Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know?
And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.
"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team."
How do you fix a price for a player?
And where was he earning it from? From a little club in India.
But we did it. You know why?
We said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually."
We all make decisions every day; we want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars, but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me, most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars, that multiplies to five, and that's more than I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.
The reason is, this isn't how people do odds.
Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan, and it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung, and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.
Compare these to the actual numbers.
The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide.
Look, I can prove this to you: here's a little lottery.
Do you want it? Most people won't play this lottery.
But in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires that you ask one, and only one question, which is: What else can I do with 25 dollars?
This is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.
This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words, a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.
Now, let's just change one thing in this scenario.
In one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.
Suddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.
The comparisons we make when we are appraising value, where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things, are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.
Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?
But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.
Now, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons, because what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks to the purchase that you're making, but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.
And the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you'll never make again.
Here's the second problem: You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?
Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months.
They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon, and I want you to notice two things.
At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman, but at a far distance their normal, their true, relations are preserved.
That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say, what was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?
We have no significant predators, we're the masters of our physical environment; the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us.
Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to -- and forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.
That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand, when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed, more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country.
So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media, who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can.
What I'm saying is that, surely, rationally, our distress about things that happen, about threats, should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come.
Poverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude, unless someone can show that there's, you know, terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.
My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking for an evolutionary explanation, you might say that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is, they're a little scared of stuff that's new and different.
The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year, so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose, and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?
I think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen, which is why they prefer that to the flushing.
AdG: In persuading them.
I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency, which is to say, "I'm here today, and so now is more important than later."
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject, I did the following series of drawings.
And now, four large panels: this is upper left; upper right; lower left; lower right.
Now, if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this, all you have to do is substitute something else, like "Indonesian."
And the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea, was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big, and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow, and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something.
I had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.
And, finally, I arrived at the following solution.
I am now exposing myself to my audience, right?
So, there's that little alternative over there, and I say, "Not bad," -- criticizing myself -- "but more didactic than visual.
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience, and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing.
That poster is not folded.
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.
I'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation, surrealism has become banal, a shadow of its former self.
And, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.
The reason is, we have sort of a built-in poison detector.
This photo taken just before his death — — is actually a — No, one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this, and if they did, they would not live to tell it, because fear would have kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator.
Darwin was probably one of the first scientists to systematically investigate the human emotions, and he pointed to the universal nature and the strength of the disgust response.
And he was really gagging. I thought he might throw up on me, actually.
If you have a good nose, you can smell the Jews."
So here are a couple of examples.
In a more recent follow-up study, we were able to look at a much greater sample, a much larger sample. In this case, this is nearly 30,000 U.S. respondents, and we find the same pattern. As you can see, people who are on the very conservative side of answering the political orientation scale are also much more likely to report that they're easily disgusted.
So physiological arousal predicted, in this study, attitudes toward gay marriage.
And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative.
They not only motivate you to behave in certain ways, but they change the way you think.
What have you done with so many years of being away?
"I destroy lives," mum said.
Court: Never.
Marcus: Read.
And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.
Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about?
Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?
Épuise, right?
What, what, what, what about, what?
The first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria, that she has a feeling she'll be happy there.
Again, this was my -- this was me talking about -- this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom, and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say, what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?
My life started as a -- I started life in 1966, a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years and it was three years of war.
C: This is the gun.
I don't remember how we got there.
Ezra: I don't remember.
My story is a little bit complicated.
A blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket.
We don't need no more ... Committee Chairman: We hope that, with your help and the help of others, that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war.
E: We were fighting for our freedom.
CC: No, we don't.
E: Then let me go.
And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers -- ex-combatants, as they like to be called.
N Thank you.
And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up.
AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...
So this shows ...
So that's Push Pop Press' first title, Al Gore's "Our Choice."
All right. Mike, thanks so much.
Richard Saul Wurman: Really?
You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent on working for somebody.
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.
And a few people got excited about it.
Back to -- everything's so temporary.
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him: you're not sure.
I didn't think he knew what he was doing, and he pulled it off.
FG: That will be finished in 2003 -- September, October -- and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys come play with us at that place.
I knew Craig and respected him.
I tried to understand that language as a beginning, as a place to jump off, and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ...
RSW: No. What did he say?
RSW: Is it going to be near the current campus?
FG: 2004.
That was the surprise of going across the river, of going on the highway around it, of walking down the street and finding it.
If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.
People put buckets out ...
And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story.
That's what reminded me of it.
FG: Yeah.
Each one was more beautiful than the other.
We stood up, we walked out.
But let me just say a couple words.
I'm a garbage man.
And of course, it's your stuff if it's broken.
We see above-ground mines.
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we're already starting to see today.
And there's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel.
And any plastic can be any color, as you probably well know.
And it's not fair, it's not safe and it's not sustainable.
So what are we to do about this space-age material, at least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?
The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals.
I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way.
We take out the things that aren't plastics, such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber, wood, glass, paper, you name it.
And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic: one type, one grade.
And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic, replacing virgin plastic, to make their new products.
And what would you do? It's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important, and really reflect on the world around us.
And that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did.
I got out of the car, and I stood up, and it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround, and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen.
But I am also for sustainability.
Not to say, "Oh my God, what is it?" but to be challenged by it -- to say, "Wow, this is beautiful," on one level, but on the other level, "This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it."
That in the recycling work that I was doing, I'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.
And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned, and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.
Because I think everything that we're involved in -- our clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything -- are directly a result.
And what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir, and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.
What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one.
And this is what they were building.
So here, if you look at this poster, it has all the trappings of Western culture.
And they have dorms for the workers.
They're called dengzahoos -- they're like pin tacks to the ground.
And also, like right now, they're just moving.
And what we would see here as a suburban development -- a similar thing, but they're all high-rises.
So a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.
10 hours a day at this speed.
I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.
The machines are all running, absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.
But the domestic was much easier to do.
This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen.
But this is what happens to most of the computers.
So that's the photographs that I wanted to show you.
Wish one: world-changing. I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.
And it's looking at technology, and it's looking at new energy-saving devices, and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize the movement towards sustainability.
So Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog, and I'm hoping that it isn't -- I don't see it as the kind of blog where we're all going to follow each other to death.
You know, we know that from earlier presentations.
And they're going to push that up, from the bottom -- up into, I believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it, and trying to help them with the projects.
And the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with -- when I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought, "There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer."
So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.
But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us, when put in certain contexts, will actually make very specific mistakes.
And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.
Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly.
And so this is why we turned to these guys here.
Does she make the same mistakes as us?
And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse, around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news, we said, hhmm, maybe we should actually start in the financial domain.
We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies, so we just called it a token.
And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.
So the monkeys get really good at this.
And so our monkey marketplace was born.
So everything costs one token, but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others, sometimes more grapes than others.
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.
The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else.
So imagine that right now I handed each and every one of you a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.
Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.
Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently.
So maybe you're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this, which is when presented with these options, people don't choose to play it safe.
Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another.
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape, so it looks pretty good.
Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial, or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky, but big, bonus, but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.
These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.
They actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started.
So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.
We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.
I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.
Thank you.
And part of the reason I love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood, I notice they react completely differently.
But the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on Earth.
A hundred million people in the world are homeless.
Almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry, and if we look at energy, it's the same story.
One cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide.
That's what people jump to as a conclusion.
And there's a lot of really good questions that are asked and important questions that we spent quite a long time working on the answers to as we put together our report and the peer reviewed report.
Eighteen percent of our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide is the result of deforestation.
If we built a 20-story building out of cement and concrete, the process would result in the manufacturing of that cement and 1,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
But only four years after it was built, Gustave Eiffel was building the Eiffel Tower, and as he built the Eiffel Tower, he changed the skylines of the cities of the world, changed and created a competition between places like New York City and Chicago, where developers started building bigger and bigger buildings and pushing the envelope up higher and higher with better and better engineering.
We're starting to push the height up of these wood buildings, and we're hoping, and I'm hoping, that my hometown of Vancouver actually potentially announces the world's tallest at around 20 stories in the not-so-distant future.
Before we could eat, she would ask, "Are all the children in?"
And, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going.
Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.
Why would daddy bring Elder Revels?
We're all strands in it.
Just a photograph.
So, sitting on a flatbed truck, the elders of the community are there, and Bobby stands up and says to the people, "I have bad news for you.
He asked them to give a message, and they each read in their own language a central affirmation, and that was some version of the golden rule: "As you would that others would do unto you, do also unto them."
Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff, but I got to do it too.
The question was: "What is the greatest commandment?"
I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs; being concerned for housing, for healthcare, for the prisoners, for the infirm, for children -- even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off, where they are going.
It is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as the day, or the year, of God's favor.
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly, this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering, but to all who sign the charter for compassion.
Well, when I got to the White House in the beginning of 2009, at the start of the Obama Administration, the White House was anything but open.
Turns out that had never been done before.
We've entrenched them. And we know that the smartest person always works for someone else.
So complain as we might, what actually can replace what we have today?
Why is Twitter so successful? Because it opens up its platform.
It's also about creating government.
Can you imagine, in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear, getting anything done in a four-month period of time?
Last year they saved a billion dollars, 30 billion rubles, from open innovation, and they're pushing radically the extension of crowdsourcing, not only from banking, but into the public sector.
Simply throwing data over the transom doesn't change how government works.
They deserve a hand.
And that's why we need to start with our youngest people.
We conventionally divide space into private and public realms, and we know these legal distinctions very well because we've become experts at protecting our private property and private space.
And it's taught us really one thing, and that is to truly make good public space, you have to erase the distinctions between architecture, urbanism, landscape, media design and so on.
The Vietnam protests, the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of AIDS, the march for women's reproductive rights, right up until almost the present.
The question is, is it possible ultimately for art to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs?
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference.
When the Hirshhorn opened, Ada Louise Huxstable, the New York Times critic, had some choice words: "Neo-penitentiary modern."
But how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it invisibly?
In our imagination, it has to be light.
That was the lounge.
I blush whenever I show this.
It's about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air.
There are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit.
And then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom.
There are extreme pressures.
The ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity.
And also, the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music.
I saw my village burned down.
I didn't know what was the war for.
So I happened to forgive. Now I sing music with the Muslims. I dance with them.
So I hope you're going to hear this.
I knew it was rude, but we needed food.
But I've never seen a dead body, at least one that I've killed.
I'm on a fight, day and night.
Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns.
Thank you.
One testimony about how I find music is powerful is when I was still a soldier back then.
I've been in a painful journey.
And so I made a commitment. I say, "I'm gonna not eat my breakfast."
But that moved me.
If anybody want to help us this is what we need.
And now we have a couple in university.
She said the only way to help Sudan is to invest in the women, educating them, educating the children, so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society.
Big scream for Emma everybody.
He never knew his father very well, because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him.
That's the corner I want to explore.
When I started representing death row inmates more than 20 years ago, people on death row did not have a right to a lawyer in either the second or the fourth chapter of this story.
In fact, as you can see from this graph, from the time that the Texas execution apparatus got efficient in the mid- to late-1990s, there've only been a couple of years where the number of annual executions dipped below 20.
it hasn't happened because of a dissolution of popular support for the death penalty. Death penalty opponents take great solace in the fact that death penalty support in Texas is at an all-time low.
Now you might think that this decline in death sentences and the increase in the number of life sentences is a good thing or a bad thing.
That's the second lesson that I've learned.
We have to say, all right.
My client Will and 80 percent of the people on death row had five chapters in their lives that came before the four chapters of the death penalty story.
That's probably a topic that is best reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges.
If we're gonna do that, we need a place to put them.
But they did all those things.
It was the day that he was going to be executed, and we were just talking.
Maybe you just remember somebody telling you."
And my father smiled and said, "Well, you know what that means, don't you?"
And my mom said, "Well, I noticed it."
I mean, she's seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus."
So, to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief.
Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10.
What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I was going to have to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends, what was most upsetting was that this meant that I was not a Virgo.
One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.
Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.
Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus.
All but one guy, this guy named Mormon, who managed to survive by hiding in the woods.
I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start -- -- telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord.
I said, "Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45, assuming they didn't die from exhaustion, it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God." And they said, "No."
What if you had a nose job and you liked it?
Now, if they'd asked me, Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?
And just a father and son trying to survive, walking along the road.
A deer freezes very, very still, poised to run away.
And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations.
How crazy is that? That our measure of progress, our dominant measure of progress in society, is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile?
We all need to love and be loved in life.
And what we do, is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.
It is an efficiency measure.
Now, there's a huge array of nations around that global average.
This is an aspirational graph.
They are the happiest place.
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world.
That's one way of looking at it.
This is not the very distant future.
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.
You put a smart meter in your home, and you see how much electricity you're using right now, how much it's costing you, your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.
At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees, which we know is really linked to creativity, which is linked to innovation, and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.
And the first of these is to connect, is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life.
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, [very] strong for our well being.
We feel good if we give.
He said, "I know there are challenges ahead, there may be trouble ahead, but I fear no one. I don't care.
And I'd like to do a little collateral thinking, if you will, about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal.
What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about.
And I think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self-absorption, to noticing, to empathy and to compassion.
Women sit at tables and men go from table to table, and there's a clock and a bell, and at five minutes, bingo, the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card or her email address to the man for follow up. And this woman says, "My brother's never gotten a card, and I know exactly why.
The word is "pizzled": it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off.
The scariest thing is that his IQ is 160: a certified genius.
When we focus on ourselves in any activity, we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person.
And it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions, for instance, that cotton is very resistant to textile dye; about 60 percent washes off into wastewater.
There's a saying in the world of information science: ultimately everybody will know everything.
And we found out that he was Hispanic, he didn't speak any English, he had no money, he'd been wandering the streets for days, starving, and he'd fainted from hunger.
He's part of this ethnic minority called the Pontic Greeks.
Once you find your base, your home, you start to built this cognitive map of your environment.
Every street is generally perceived as a straight line, and we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make.
The second thing that we do to make a place our own is we attach meaning and emotions to the things that we see along those lines.
It's got 90 degree corners.
Now the very key to the success of this map is in the omission of less important information and in the extreme simplification.
But when you explore a foreign and new public transport system, you will build a cognitive map in your mind in pretty much the same way.
So that's what I did. I researched how each and every bus route moved through the city, nice and logical, every bus route a separate line, and I plotted it into my own map of Dublin, and in the city center, I got a nice spaghetti plate.
So here's what we did.
This map only shows the rapid transport connections, no local bus, very much in the Metro map style that was so successful in London, and that since has been exported to so many other major cities, and therefore is the language that we should use for public transport maps.
If you, for example, have a look at the two main corridors that run through the city, the yellow and orange one over here, this is how they look in an actual, accurate street map, and this is how they would look in my distorted, simplified public transport map.
But nothing, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008.
Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control, I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband, Jayant.
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life, and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."
How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all?
I needed something to go that extra mile, and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four.
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule.
It's the power of an image.
So going back to 1989, I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.
They brought all sorts of different computers with them.
He had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner.
Well, some people did.
It's been a blast, hasn't it?
Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.
He had put it together, combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he'd put it into this software, which I think his son developed, originally, and produces this wonderful presentation.
Who's at the event? Whatever it is about that person, where they were born, things like that.
So I can browse this stuff.
And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up, he noticed that Wikipedia -- you know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it.
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms.
Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important, but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.
We want unadulterated data.
TBL: Alright, "raw data now"!
In fact, I'll just go into one area -- if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example, drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos, because they had their genomics data in one database in one building, and they had their protein data in another.
Scientists are totally stymied at the moment -- the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.
The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it -- tremendous frustration.
I did that to the map. I just did that!
So, linked data -- it's huge.
And I think it's an idea worth spreading.
Some people don't. And if we like them, we've got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward.
Anyway, for now, anyone involved in getting these results, thank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it.
Should those be in the new package of goals?
Let's go into every country that will let us in, ask 1,001 people what they want the new goals to be, making special efforts to reach the poorest, those without access to modern technology, and let's make sure that their views are at the center of the goals going forward.
Well, there's some fantastic examples here to scale up, mostly piloted within Africa, actually.
Both, if we're honest, a bust.
Now sure, progress in China and India and poverty reduction there was key to that, but recently also in Africa, poverty rates are being reduced.
I mean, it dwarfs, dwarfs everything that is actually on our news agenda, and it's invisible.
Rio, if anyone cares about the environment, need not have been a bust, okay?
Have you met anyone interesting?
You've started one or two in your time.
So I've seen life as one long learning process.
We had -- we were being attacked by British Airways.
RB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality, that you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they -- They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit?
Ain't virgin no longer, or something.
So, just help us with some of the numbers.
RB: Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles, I think.
I mean, it is a tough job.
Well, God saved her and you got your just reward.
OK. So let's look at the space thing.
But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design.
RB: Many times.
But the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know -- something seemed to go wrong every time, and on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped, and left me holding on for dear life.
And wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again, looked down at those clouds again, climbed back into the capsule again.
The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls, you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere.
Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school?
And generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news.
So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader, but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ...
But is there a risk here?
I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.
And John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us.
That's great.
RB: I don't actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top, generally speaking, works.
And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together.
RB: Well, there's -- I mean there's a lot of issues.
So, for instance, there's a doctor in Africa that's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant, that the baby will not have HIV when it's born.
But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently.
RB: I'm 56.
And I think one of the positive things at the moment is you've got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance, who are good friends.

My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting.
So at that time -- and I was 13 -- and I was listening to just radio, and someone happened to sit next to me, like these three people are sitting here.
So that's what made me enter [the] college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what I really want to do with art work, or art and finally I'm here in front of you.
So this is called "Self In Progress."
So I just thought, "I'm going to capture thumbprint, footprint, or whatever traces we leave as humans."
Even though we have traces when we try to understand them, the perception and context play a major role to understand it.
The answer can be so different if Potter said it.
It just all depends on one's perception.
So what we conceive as a meaning is always not there; it's on the other side, even when we say dark, light, good, bad, tall, short -- all meaning it doesn't exist in reality.
It's about six inches deep in the wall, but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall.
But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six, seven months, in the restroom, when I was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor.
This is the fee for the project report, and we will give you all the details," and they gave.
So this is after a few weeks, this is after a few months.
"Light makes dark and now evaporating self.
This is the first day -- it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other.
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark, but it's filled with light all the time.
And skin at the other end also represents the floor.
And then again, at that point, there is no shadow.
This is called "Kaayam."
Thank you.
So the best way I've found of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat, may not even be close to flat, is with some data.
Or let's turn to people moving across borders.
If you look at the official statistics, they typically indicate a little bit above 30 percent.
First of all, there is a suggestion of some error.
Let me give you an example. When I first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called Foreign Policy, one of the people who wrote in, not entirely in agreement, was Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled "Why the World Isn't Flat," that wasn't too surprising.
The perspective was, here is this poor professor.
Because, in some sense, it's the ideal kind of technology to think about. Theoretically, it makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door.
So being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more, something that would contribute further to global welfare.
The reassuring thing about this particular survey was, when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data, some of them — not all of them — seemed to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid.
But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market.
And the rest says it all.
So, hopefully this will bring back some happy, or possibly some slightly disturbing memories.
The marketing is, the bigger a brand, the more difficult it is to reposition it.
So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.
The marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do.
It was, for a long time, revered as the most reliable of cars, and then they had the big recall incident.
If we go back 20 years, the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand.
This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people, more in with the people.
And in Spanish, "zanfona."
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique.
It's made by specialized luthiers, also in Europe.
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel.
And if you're a benchwarmer, you might be a virgin or somebody who for whatever reason isn't in the game, maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skillset.
And it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults.
It's not exactly your choice.
We're not playing with each other.
And because it's an internal desire, we actually have some sense of control over that.
"Well, maybe we can go half and half."
Not everybody can play baseball. It's pretty exclusive.
Well, in baseball, you play to win.
If you eat too much, though, you just feel gross.
You do. I do.
"What 'tis to love?" Shakespeare said.
You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.
But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them.
You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually, you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else.
When I put these people in the machine, before I put them in the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions.
as if I had asked them to pass the salt.
But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.
I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy and great sorrow.
It can be focused on nobody.
For every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend.
In short, we're really moving forward to the past.
There's a lot of gender differences; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child.
But even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.
In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, "To have a great writer is to have another government."
Men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous, focus on what they do, and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern.
I'm always astonished when people come to me and say, "Why is it that men are so adulterous?"
We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality.
They're now saying that in America, that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85.
And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now.
But these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment, aren't always connected to each other.
I want to conclude with a worry -- I have a worry -- and with a wonderful story.
I would recommend it.
The things are connected in the brain.
I said, "I don't know anything about personality. You know?
And I also think that you gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.
And they were all at a conference in Beijing.
But I will end by saying that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives: the sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner.
That wasn't being asked.
You see, unlike the woman the night before, this woman had type 2 diabetes.
She ate too much. She got unlucky.
I had become insulin-resistant.
I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore.
What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?
So for many of us, about 75 million Americans, the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse, getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat.
Cause and effect.
So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance, and you can be lean and have it, this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what's going on.
Now, we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run, and there's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly.
For the past year, I've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country, and the best part is, just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals, we've done the same thing.
Briefly, to address this, our research program is focused around three meta-themes, or questions.
Staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science.
Maybe the system, of which I was a part, was letting you down.
And I decided about that time, about age 10, that it would be really cool if I was a test driver.
So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.
And that's a belief that I share.
They thought that we were more interested, as an industry, in profits, rather than progress, and that we filled the skies with smog -- and frankly, we were the enemy.
And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists.
And actually, although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do, I can see the day where my two great passions -- cars and the environment -- actually come into harmony.
But with more people and greater prosperity around the world, that number's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century.
When you factor in population growth, it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow.
My great grandfather once said before he invented the Model T, "If I had asked people then what they wanted, they would have answered, 'We want faster horses.'" So the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads.
The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another, and they go underneath the city streets.
These are all really good ideas that will move us forward.
But the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless.
Now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work, but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions -- whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet; our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure must support all the future options.
It's going to really require a national energy policy, frankly for each country, because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels, traffic jams and also how integrated the systems already are.
And it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this.
And how do you bring those two things together?
Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.
6:20.
So they snapped into action.
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.
So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.
And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention -- saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road, when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.
They'll ask the nurses to input data.
So, again, this idea of workarounds.
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.
It's there for our use, on some level.
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing.
Children assume permission in a very different way.
It's a completely empathic solution -- apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.
So, again, we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.
Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.
We feel that this is an important gesture.
We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
That's them rolling.
And we did. The data was conclusive.
So, how did the city respond?
Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.
So, on August 15th, again, Independence Day, 2009, empowered with the same process, we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."
Infection in India.
See? They have done it.
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you, for a very good cause, the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?

He said, "I think the most important thing to happen in 2006 was that living and thinking green hit Main Street.
And at that period it was -- in a way, a number of things were happening.
And there are some of those qualities in this drawing, which seeks to sum up the recommendations.
A very, very beautiful object.
You cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit.
So basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there, that the energy consumed reduces dramatically.
In other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening, 1,000 new cars every day -- statistically, it's the biggest booming auto market in the world -- and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing.
The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis and Faber, in a small market town in the northeast of England, commuting distance with London.
And the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time.
We were fortunate, because in a way our building was future-proofed.
And again, the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality.
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology, the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit, to transfer that information now, directly into the factory.
I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979, which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here.
And at that particular point in time, this was one of the few solitary computers.
This is the view you would get, if you looked down on that.
You can measure it again.
What are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site?
And the base of the building is again about public space.
In other words, water is the lifeblood.
And what is interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega-building.
And I was voicing the thought that -- it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve, a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 -- that maybe, you know, the future was the most powerful, innovative sort of nation.
Well that was not by me.
And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said when he said, "Light: I make it in my buildings for comfort."
And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum.
This is, I think, a very illustrative image of what I try to say -- that the beautiful dynamics of sun, bringing these into the building, creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives.
This is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago, which is the reason I bring him up now, because it's kind of an anniversary year.
It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land, highlighting it compared to the dim environment.
And I will explain that further.
And by modulating the amount of blue in our environment, we can help people to relax, or to be alert, to fall asleep, or to stay awake.
But when you look at this planet at night, it looks like this.
The world is changing though, and urbanization is a big driver of everything.
And of course, we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that.
It's the same thing as you can see over there -- just 200 times bigger.
I just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works.
Like here -- this is a very low light level actually.
They are not disturbed anymore.
And we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments.
And finally I want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater.
That is the message, which we started 31 years ago.
Is it that I write very well?
So what kind of a contributor was I?
In fact, they invite the honey bees through their colors, and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.
How will it be a knowledge society?
Anybody? Any guess at all?
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people.
And she does it a few thousand times every day.
Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head?
This person, whom we met -- and you will see it on the website, www.sristi.org -- this tribal person, he had a wish.
Look at this.
Look at what she has done.
So he thought, why don't I convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine?
They have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.
Now, what we need is, we need people who will be able to scale them up.
This is less than a dollar and this is non-stick; it is coated with one of these food-grade materials.
And now with one dollar, you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you.
For example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.
And we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio, where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities, and yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable.
New inventions are the passion of my life.
It's not that a coconut fell on my head, and I came upon this idea.
you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates and then you will find these videos.
India and China have the largest number of cycles.
There's an axle here, of 30, 40 kg, serving no purpose.
And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe, but this is available in India.
We have sold things all over the world, from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.
This morning, the world's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats, I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.
But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first, it would be that from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology.
It was half as long.
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.
And if you just look at how technology has been applied, we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume, large-weight problems of moving things around.
And we all love our cars, and I do.
Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.
The 20 largest cities in the world.
I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two, and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.
So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.
And the camera is looking down at her.
So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years, the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys, call AARP, get an appointment right away.
Cars were not meant for parallel parking; they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it: we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.
And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.
It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity, you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing, with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat, then using a little bit of the electricity control that process, and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat, it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it.
For two straight days, the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well-organized group, presumably from the local criminal organization, La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.
The two marches joined together, and they continued their path towards the state capital.
And so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved.
To put these numbers in perspective, Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.
I urge you, but only a little bit, because I don't want to get you in trouble, to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it, whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S., and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message, they guarantee delivery of the drug in 30 minutes or less.
But this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy.
They focus most of their recruiting on the army, and they very openly advertise for better salaries, better benefits, better promotion paths, not to mention much better food, than what the army can deliver.
Their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement, so they invest heavily in providing local services, like dealing with home violence, going after petty criminals, treating addicts, and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are, and, of course, protecting people from other criminal organizations.
and the Mexican borders, but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet.
When they're entering a new market, they send a family member to supervise it, or, if they're partnering with a new organization, they create a family tie, either through marriages or other types of ties.
The second thing I want you to remember is that these are sophisticated, coherent organizations that are business organizations, and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach.
But also it's part of being any monthly magazine -- you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.
This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.
I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future," but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.
Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free.
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them, and bring the rest of your entertainment in.
And then finally, DVDs are approaching free.
Start with gene sequencing.
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.
If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.
Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business, which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.
Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year; they already have nearly four million registered users -- that's critical mass.
It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.
This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.
Thank you.
Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies.
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid, but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it.
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives.
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers, because these systems were both too expensive, and they were constructed for fields that were too large.
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth.
And though that company has just started, our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions.
This idea of scale is critical.
And then measure the returns, both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective.
I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now, and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population, and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.
And finally, at the end of the journey, I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.
But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power.
It will take embracing the world with both arms.
But then I started thinking about my family.
I'm a blogger, which, probably to a lot of you, means different things.
He makes enough money, just by running ads, to support his family up in Oregon.
I wasn't happy with my job, because I was a designer, but I wasn't being really stimulated.
And I said, "I'm going to win this award -- the South by Southwest Weblog award."
And those people who know me understood my joke.
I've been with him since I was 17 years old. We've never had a separate bank account.
I wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today.
These things resonate with us, and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs, the history paintings about, you know, all biblical stories, and then you have this.
Pictures were taken every day: day one, day two ...
So, blogs.
Whenever I think about blogs I'm like, "Oh, we've got to reach all these people."
But this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my direct line.
And it's pretty sad, because I only go back five generations, and then it's it. I don't even know what happens on my mom's side, because she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things.
I know that one day my children will be wondering -- or my grandchildren, or my great-grandchildren, if I ever have children -- what I am going to -- who I was, so I do something that's very narcissistic: I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time everyday.
It's not just always smiling. Now I've kind of evolved it, so I have this look.
That this woman is in England, and she lives -- she lived a life where she was talking about what she was doing.
Bluefin are warmblooded like us.
For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal, and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago.
Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin.
These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months.
And we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works.
And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU, getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays, an engineering challenge we've yet to really overcome.
We can see in their beauty of form and function, their ceaseless activity.
And then, better yet, we've got our own version of tuna whisperers, our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton, who can take a big tuna and in one motion, put it into an envelope of water, so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea.
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada, from Corsica to Spain.
And when it goes, we're always happy.
Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.
And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles, we can get information on gender, checking the pop-up tag one more time, and then it's out in the ocean.
Astronomically, we're calculating positions.
This model, a model of overlap, is the way to move forward.
So what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska, met salmon shark on their home territory, followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line, we can actually take up a salmon shark -- This is the cousin of the white shark -- and very carefully -- note, I say "very carefully," -- we can actually keep it calm, put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag.
It's a several thousand-pound animal.
The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable: three teams tagged 1,700 tunas, bluefin, yellowfin and albacore all at the same time -- carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas, put in the tags that actually have the sensors, stick out the tuna and then let them go.
And Scott Benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey.
They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.
We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.
Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.
And usually when I tell people I'm an artist, they just look at me and say, "Do you paint?"
And as I was coming back, well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent, and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- "Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?
"Where were you the 29th? the 30th?"
And he looks at me really confused and says, "No explosives?"
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life -- back and forth, not six months continuously.
"Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes."
I know everything's fine."
Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March 12th" or whatever.
with pictures, with travel tips.
And I'll help you out.
This is in Warsaw.
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know.
And there's a verification taking place.
I had to tell them every little detail of everything.
So you get something like this.
At 11:39 a.m. was this one.
If you go to my site, there's tons of things.
Well you have to take control over it.
And we're getting to that.
Because no one's really watching.
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by -- Department of Homeland Security.
Hasan, just curious.
So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks, send, and then it's done.
Today I'd like to explore with you why the answer to this question will become profoundly important in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset.
If you don't like the hotel, there's a castle down the road that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night.
Now, what's happening here is people are realizing the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity and value of all kinds of assets, from skills to spaces to material possessions, in ways and on a scale never possible before.
Now, this little anecdote gets to the heart of why I'm really passionate about collaborative consumption, and why, after I finished my book, I decided I'm going to try and spread this into a global movement.
But the key reason why it's taking off now so fast is because every new advancement of technology increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust to make sharing easier and easier.
Kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow.
I actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousand loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded through TaskRabbit.
How to ensure our digital identities reflect our real world identities? Do we want them to be the same?
And interestingly, what Chris has noted is that as his reputation has gone up, so has his chances of winning a bid and how much he can charge.
This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data on how well we behave or misbehave.
People's lives are too complex, and who wants to do that?
This isn't some far-off frontier.
Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.
What they heard was that users were putting their reputation scores on the top of their résumés, and that recruiters were searching the platform to find people with unique talents.
He's turning 50 this year, and he's convinced that the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life.
And what that truly ghastly, awful sound does is stop the single most important behavioral experience that we have, and that's sleep.
Any ideas who said that?
And if we also jump into the 1980s, some of you may remember that Margaret Thatcher was reported to have said, "Sleep is for wimps."
You don't eat. You don't drink.
The point I'm trying to make is that when you're asleep, this thing doesn't shut down.
But what I haven't explained is what sleep is about.
So there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis.
But the third idea I'm quite attracted to, which is brain processing and memory consolidation.
Okay. So we've had three explanations for why we might sleep, and I think the important thing to realize is that the details will vary, and it's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons.
So in the 1950s, good data suggests that most of us were getting around about eight hours of sleep a night.
So the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor, again in that sort of five-hour region.
At another level of terror, we dip into the tragic accidents at Chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle Challenger, which was so tragically lost.
Well, of course, you then resort to alcohol.
Well, sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin, the hunger hormone.
Increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation.
Good. We'll talk more about that later, about what are your tips.
Light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep.
Basically, listen to yourself.
Simple as that.
Okay. So for the last part, the last few minutes, what I want to do is change gears and talk about some really new, breaking areas of neuroscience, which is the association between mental health, mental illness and sleep disruption.
Their sleep was absolutely smashed.
So we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems.
If we know that these individuals are vulnerable, early intervention then becomes possible.
If you have good sleep, it increases your concentration, attention, decision-making, creativity, social skills, health.
I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist.
These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
The measure we've used, because it's easy to understand and you can download it, is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country.
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.
Here, for instance, is trust.
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust.
This is violence.
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing, harsher sentencing.
And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.
One is that, in graph after graph, we find the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
It has lower taxes.
This is just one example.
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.
Interestingly, some parallel work going on in social psychology: some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones, their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.
Otherwise that would introduce bias.
Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.
Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting.
And I guess what's interesting is, is that I am now obsessed with the technology of the body.
So, we all understand what it feels like to know where the ends of your fingers are when you hold out your arms, yeah?
I thought what I'd do is, I'd use three versions of physical thinking to make something.
Yeah? It's absolutely there.
And we'll see what we come up with.
That's it.
Some dancers, when they're watching action, take the overall shape, the arc of the movement, the kinetic sense of the movement, and use that for memory.
I want you to think about them as architectural objects, so what they are, are just pure lines.
Here we go, ready? And ... bam, bake ...
Grab her waist, come up back into her first, whoom, spin, turn her, whoo-aa. Great.
Kick it out of the way. Throw it into the audience. Whoom.
So good. So -- Okay. So that was -- Well done.
What I'd like you to do what that is take an aspect of it.
So the dancers have been working on them.
So yeah, let's clap -- yeah, let's clap afterwards.
Thank you very much.
But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.
Well, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.
You want a dirty magazine?
So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.
I mean, it's just wonderful.
So actually, I took a carton of orange juice and I poured it in the glass to take this picture.
And I can tell you stories about it, which makes it reflective, and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design," you get 10 pages of results.
Now, the weird thing is Google lies, because if I type "design and emotion," it says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway."
And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it, this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.
Intense fear paralyzes you.
So, she'd bring people into the room, and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here.
And turns out they liked it, and it made them happy -- not very happy, but a little bit of happy.
The brain works differently if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative.
So that's the visceral level.
Visceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
They're so nicely balanced, so sharp, that you really feel you're in control of the cutting.
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line.
And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else -- because their muscles are acting, subconsciously, except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.
Here's a great reflective product.
But it's ugly.
And that's what's nice about emotion.
Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center, you get to remoter areas.
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car, looked up on Google, found a route into northern India from New Delhi which, you know, which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers, and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests, and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was, "Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" -- 69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that, they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi, and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi -- because, you know, those are relatively better off areas -- and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools, where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing.
If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies, then you don't need an alternative education.
They cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall -- and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end, a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall, put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there, put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.
The last question is what everybody said, but you know, I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office, can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.
When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children, like, children would come and see what's happening over here.
I took the experiment out to northeastern India, to a village called Madantusi, where, for some reason, there was no English teacher, so the children had not learned English at all.
And they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs."
This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.
What did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct in a connected environment, irrespective of anything that we could measure.
What could they learn to do?
Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children, who are also advising, usually wrongly, about everything that's going on on the computer.
It was that primary education can happen on its own, or parts of it can happen on its own.
So I leave you with this third question.
Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first, and other areas later.
And such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness, values and violence.
It's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can't find it.
But these things are everywhere.
And you say, "Hey, could you bring the skim milk?"
Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay.
And what they learned was that those little things, done right, actually matter, and that well-designed moments can build brands.
Thank you.
I'm colorblind.
As a child, I read the newspaper thoroughly.
That year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat, and 20 of us succeeded.
Later, I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.
I was the chief British negotiator on the subject, and I was steeped in the issue.
I had a good time.
And eventually, I decided to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo, which was then under U.N. administration.
But anyway, I gave that testimony, and that presented me with a crisis.
I can't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what I used to do gladly for them.
I love diplomacy -- I have no career -- I expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country.
It was anarchy.
There was this whole fancy diplomatic system, this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo, and the Kosovars weren't part of it.
And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service.
And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government.
And we started talking, and he said -- I told him what I was doing, and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York.
We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office.
States mean less than they used to, and the power of the state is declining.
What this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations, or global affairs, or chaos in Somalia, or what's going on in Burma is none of your business, and that you can leave it to governments to get on with.
Its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states -- interstate conflict.
You've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think.
The Security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago, when I was there 10 years ago.
The chances of failure are very high, but it certainly won't happen if we don't try to make it happen.
We like it. We like some parts of it.
But my idea today is not to debate whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience.
You have hunger; you have sex; you have power; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness.
So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious.
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity?
Okay, here we go.
The Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot, the Civil Rights movement, race riots, the Vietnam War, MLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot, Watergate.
This chart is going to document a very similar trend.
The socially irreverent hippie show, "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."
In 1970, the dam bursts. The dam bursts.
It can change us?
What were those shows?
But look: X marks the spot.
What do people want in their TV then?
We're animals, we need our moms.
So to you all, the women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen, the global audiences of TEDWomen, thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television.
This happens one day: I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology: viruses and how they attack.
I have no idea what to do next.
Maybe he's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere, and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good.
And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA, the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses.
Instead, it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA, and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell, waiting for instructions.
And now all of you understand it.
Right? I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun when they're learning science.
For example, I told you that viruses have DNA.
It's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know, who gives us all the details nobody cares about, where you're like, "Oh, I met my friend for lunch the other day, and she was wearing these ugly jeans.
We have to convince our audience that what we're talking about matters.
This needs to stop, and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems, and I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it.
Pick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever, but leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon.
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference.
So here's the metaphor I'm offering today.
Stephen Bradley: I thought I saw the savior in human shape for about one second in the room, with arms extended, appearing to say to me, "Come."
Some shut down the self using meditation.
And that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences.
JH: So what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out, or melt away, and it feels good, it feels really good, in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives.
We pursue our individual goals.
And think of the collective grief in the United States that we all felt, that brought us all together, after 9/11.
Well many scientists who study religion take this view.
He went on to say that "Selfish and contentious people will not cohere, and without coherence nothing can be effected."
And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport.
The main argument against group selection has always been that, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators, but as soon as you have a group of cooperators, they're just going to get taken over by free-riders, individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others.
So here's how things play out.
For example, why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own DNA, totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus?
Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria.
Human groups may look like hives for brief moments, but they tend to then break apart.
Jonathan Haidt: We humans have many varieties of religious experience, as William James explained.
I mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects, people and ideas.
We unleashed Earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort.
I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia.

There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.
On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.
The guy did it all himself.
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.
He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics, and he trains in this space. He trains other people.
And I realized that's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did.
Now, I agree that you have to -- yeah, there are certain concessions and, you know, if you use a slide projector, you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side, or up or down, but maybe that's an O.K. trade-off, to trade that off for a focus.
Everything's gotten simpler in design, and here's this mega airport, and God, I just -- I took a picture.
Take a look at the second door and see if there's any different message.
And this graffiti artist has come along, made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.
When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it, he said no; he said he didn't believe it was the end of print.
It's not a matter of teaching it; in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it: it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design, but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter.
"Don't mistake legibility for communication."
So, this was the contents page originally.
"People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe, and no possible occupation except information gathering."
And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal, and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.
Got no way of tracking it, so I could be totally wrong.
Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts, a school in Florida.
And it was interesting to me -- my background is in sociology; I had no design training, and sometimes people say, well, that explains it -- but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that I had to sell; it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve.
It says, "Wonder Around." And then it's a piece of the software.
So, I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it; I think it's a very small-minded approach, the world is certainly much more global, and I certainly think the people of Germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer, though we'll never know.
You could -- you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something: it is the actual article.
The coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue.
One -- who knows what she's going through; the other one is worried about model behavior and milk.
I'm not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea, because, like, if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer, you can now get a plate in the keyboard, so there's no more faking it -- that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway.
If you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work, and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well.
And the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.
And when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students, What's the definition of a good job?
Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?
It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.
Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that, I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations.
But it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say, if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?
This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.
And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.
We find life at the bottom of every long-term, long-distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.
Like those chloroplast cells -- they're completely surrounded by other life.
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products.
So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization, towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor, you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.
But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom, those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.
And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.
It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact, what's important is that this information actually never died out.
They're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.
And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.
And so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.
We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.
You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
Thank you.
These are two automatic sniper stations currently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea.
And what changed? Technological innovation.
But time is a factor.
But there's a second powerful incentive pushing decision-making away from humans and onto machines, and that's electromagnetic jamming, severing the connection between the drone and its operator.
This raises the very real possibility of anonymous war.
Cell phone geolocation, telecom metadata, social media, email, text, financial transaction data, transportation data, it's a wealth of real-time data on the movements and social interactions of people.
Now, if you're a marketer, you might then target them with product samples, try to spread your brand through their social group.
But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous, because they will almost certainly be used, and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions.
I think the secret will be transparency.
It would allow us to avail ourselves of the use of autonomous vehicles and drones while still preserving our open, civil society.
I grew up in Mobile, Alabama -- somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? -- and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers, forming this beautiful delta.
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors, just pulsing all of these colors.
Now, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at, but they didn't really interact with people.
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.
Maybe I can do this all the time.
Anyway, one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef.
And after the first week, they ignored us.
So we created a way to find out, and I got my first look at that famous beak in action.
Down you go. There's no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio.
But we're just going to zip right past this area, this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.
It made scientists rethink where life on Earth might have actually begun.
pshhh! There's another volcano going.
There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.
I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.
Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.
Look in your heart, actually.
Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.
The term "deep six" comes to mind: "If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill, deep six it!"
I also want to use this work to let more people pay attention to the living condition of artists and the condition of their creative freedom.
The six people in the photo are Xia Gang workers.
This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.
This is an aircraft carrier moored alongside the Hudson River.
What will making myself invisible here cause people to think?
There is no Photoshop involved.
And the repeated struggles in life create artwork, no matter in what form.
There were plenty of role models all around us.
We're told what shape we're supposed to be in.
Humor relies on the traditions of a society.
And then also my family was in chaos, and I drew to try to bring my family together -- -- try to bring my family together with laughter.
Now my perspective is a particularly -- -- my perspective is a particularly American perspective.
My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world -- countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Argentina, France -- and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties.
That's where all these problems come from.
Everybody in this room, if you stay alive, is going to be affected by what's happening in cities in this extraordinary phenomenon.
And the question is: Is that what Edinburgh and London and New York are going to look like in 2050, or is it going to be this?
The first is: Are cities part of biology?
All companies die, all companies.
The same principles, the same dynamics, the same organization is at work in all of these, including us, and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.
You grow very quickly and then you stop.
This is a bunch of software companies -- and what it is is their revenue versus their age -- all zooming away, and everybody making millions and billions of dollars.
And yet, despite all of that Darwinian evolution and natural selection, they've been constrained to lie on a line.
Now any physiological variable you can think of, any life history event you can think of, if you plot it this way, looks like this.
One of the things I did not stress in that introduction was that, systematically, the pace of life decreases as you get bigger.
And here's scaling of cities.
This is just European countries, but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia, always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree.
And we've looked at everything: more AIDS cases, flu, etc.
What is the reason for this?
If it's social networks with super-linear scaling -- more per capita -- then the theory says that you increase the pace of life.
And indeed, one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super-linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation, then indeed you get, from the same theory, a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely.
We have to accelerate on a continuous basis.
And we've looked at 23,000 companies in the United States, may I say.
Let's go up to 2008.
In 1931, my grandmother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- graduated from the eighth grade.
But the information was closer to me.
I posed a problem in front of them, which was to put on an election forum for their own community.
I had to just sit and watch.
And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina, which is the gentleman that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer, but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.
Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information?
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media, and take a look at what were the interesting components of it, and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history.
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.
And then we went to another one -- it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information -- and spent an hour talking about the learning process, because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect, or whether or not it was what I could create.
But this is learning too, because we asked them to go out into real spaces.
And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.
We've come a long way since then.
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?
How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this?
They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
So today's reality is that if we get sick, the message is we will treat your symptoms, and you need to adjust to a new way of life.
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.
I'm going to show you an example of each of these, and I'm going to start with materials.
And although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.
That material contained only natural signals.
There are now 400,000 patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds.
There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.
And what I'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.
We need all sorts of new technology, new devices, to get the cells to the right place at the right time.
There go the cells.
Out comes the liposuction fluid, and in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.
Everything that is done to treat burn -- basically we do a sodding approach.
So let me finish up with some good news, and maybe a little bit of bad news.
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.
We've had a different approach.
And these TEDsters are -- you know, as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.
We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits, unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.
So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.
She's a very nice, young black girl.
Not only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities.
You know, she's only half Jewish.
And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time -- you're all so young.
I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know.
The point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess.
My name is Noraida. And I'm just -- I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference that you're doing and everything like that.
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.
I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like, you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know, which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.
And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there.
That's very good. I love that.
Well, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.
The teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.
And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.
My name is Pauline Ning, and first I want to tell you that I'm -- of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.
But when they got older, when the time comes for them to start think about getting married, that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.
She only wants to spend time with her friends.
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas, but I told my daughter that this is one exception -- -- that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.
Thank you. Xie xie.
So you will get the extra credit I promised you.
Well, so okay, but please, please, but please.
Thank you very, very much. I love you.
In 2003, I was ready to do a talk about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.
Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.
One is the gap in opportunity -- this gap that President Clinton last night called uneven, unfair and unsustainable -- and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all these evils that we see around us.
And their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place.
I started a couple of businesses that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.
Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.
And that really resonated with me.
And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease, which is really a scourge in the developing world.
And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing, what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?
And our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change.
But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film, there was actually something they could do to make a difference.
At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.
and it's really changed the debate on global warming.
And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner," based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.
One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person, or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person, but every one of us is all of those things and more.
Just to put everything in context, and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from, so that a lot of the things I'm going to say, and the things I'm going to do -- or things I'm going to tell you I've done -- you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.
People getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from, the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.
Believe it or not, some of us do survive.
I think it's quite significant. This is where they go.
In fact, when I start running around saying, "Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S., can you come home with me and do a mission?"
Because it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?
Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.
Look, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?
It looks like all these Americans are here and yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything -- he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian, I just thought about that.
People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease, VSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies.
Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care, and just watch that chair, all right?
Let's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them, gives them the tools they need to keep going."
And guess what, if it all fails, if you can find a car that's still got a live battery and you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it.
This is what makes it so special.
You have to do it. Africans have to do it, in conjunction with everyone else.
You can see the bars of the window there.
I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there, they would be shocked.
They work in the field.
I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- I went to about 12 different countries.
I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe -- he's the director of UNAIDS.
It's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic.
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.
That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.
We shall prevail.
And more controversially, recently, Apple censored a Palestinian protest app after the Israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks.
And their sovereignties, cross-cutting, globally interlinked, can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation-states in very exciting ways, but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and cannot do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world.
And Egyptian activists are assuming that these technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there.
Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends.
You have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where, effectively, the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government.
But this is a website called Rospil that's an anti-corruption site.
We don't necessarily always do it very well, but we have a sense of what the models are, politically and institutionally, to do that.
Similarly, governments don't enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day.
But it's going to require innovation that's not only going to need to focus on politics, on geopolitics, but it's also going to need to deal with questions of business management, investor behavior, consumer choice and even software design and engineering.
But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP.
I then started writing about Eastern Europe, and eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region, which is what I was doing in 1989.
It may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in Eastern Europe.
And in Bulgaria, the mafia was soon joined with 14,000 people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between 1989 and 1991.
Why? Well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing, but also, as they say in the retail trade, it's location, location, location.
And then, of course, it has zones of consumption, like the European Union, Japan and of course, the United States.
Now, coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone, in almost every laptop and games console.
From 1994, for seven years, 20 of these boats made the trip across the Adriatic, from Montenegro to Italy, every single night.
So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making?
On a positive note, we at last have someone in the White House who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities.
It's one of the tens of thousands of mom-and-pop grow-ops in B.C.
Now that is a game changer, because it shifts production away from the developing world and into the Western world.
People don't smoke as much dope, or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession.
And it's actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it's not so much the technology.
So, cybercrime, do watch out for it.
You don't have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime.
Thank you very much.
We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference, very, very closely related.
Now 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question.
The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and place as the hominids.
It's not a minority theory.
Nobody has questioned it.
So that is what they have done now.
And he called it hypothesis-free science.
You've exposed us to public ridicule!
And you're tempted to think, well perhaps, could that be why we are naked?
The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.
But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs, if they want to, for a short time.
We cannot avoid the suspicion that in our case it's started to happen.
The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds.
How do they react when I say these things?
Well I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?"
There was Professor Tobias. He's come over.
That would be very sad.
You'll get a new synthesis.
They decided in 1960, "That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis."
And if you hope to make progress in this profession, and you do believe it, you'd better keep it to yourself, because it will get in your way."
It's such a large conference.
Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment, and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business, on which premise I write you.
This is really embarrassing.
Are you? Oh, yeah. So what are you, like, a thousand, two thousand, somewhere in there? Huh? Oh?
And I was like, "Get the fuck out of here. That's crazy."
In March of 2001 -- I filmed myself dancing to Madonna's "Justify My Love."
Maybe I can come back next year, or something like that.
But you know, it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans, so I said, "Sure."
You can do heckler mode.
"Why?" And I say, "Mom, Dad -- "I'm trying." You know, I don't know if you're all aware of this, but the video -- the video game market, kids are playing these video games, oh, but, supposedly, there's tons of money.
"Buddhist," of course, looks very, very similar to "Atheist."
So really, what are we talking about here? Oh, tech joy.
Over 500 entries in three weeks, toilet paper fashion.
You can draw your simple stick figure, and then it collaborates with you to create, sort of, like, a post-war German etching.
None of the haikus were written by the same person, and in fact, no line was -- you know, each line is contributed by a different person at a different -- at a different time.

And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart: One is reputation and influence.
How about you get on the phone?
We live in a digital world, but we're fairly analog creatures.
Second of all, I'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month.
Paragraph number two: You may actually have to just get very blunt and say what's really on your mind.
So, in paragraph number four, you're going to tell people, "If no one is providing you with this information, let me help."
So, you send the copy to the main office.
Get writing.
You go into these booths, you interview your grandmother or relative, you leave with a copy of the interview and an interview goes into the Library of Congress.
And he saved up and he purchased this, and he proposed to my mother with this, and so I thought that I would give it to you so that he could be with us for this also.
Jake Barton: So I have to say I did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry because they all make you cry.
So, for example, you can click on this individual lion head, and this is where it originated from, 1300 B.C.
And so you can imagine that, as people are performing inside of the museum itself, you get this sense of this emotional connection, this way in which our face connects with the thousands and tens of thousands of years.
And so what we started with was really a new way of thinking about building an institution, through a project called Make History, which we launched in 2009.
And we got this amazing email that said, "While viewing the thousands of photos on the site, I unexpectedly found a photo of my son.
Voice 5: I was in Times Square. Voice 6: São Paolo, Brazil.
Voice 16: All channels in Italy were displaying the same thing.
And as you leave that storytelling moment understanding about 9/11, we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening and actually talk to the individual visitors and ask them their own experiences about 9/11.
Voice 2: It's something that we shared, and it's something that united us.
You can see the way that the geography of the event is reflected inside of the memorial, and you can search for an individual name, or in this case an employer, Cantor Fitzgerald, and see the way in which all of those names, those hundreds of names, are actually organized onto the memorial itself, and use that to navigate the memorial.
And this is our hope, that's there's poetry inside of each of our stories.
And it's pretty simple.
And so it all started several years ago, late one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home, and I was thinking.
And when you speak out loud, the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.
And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves.
And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back, I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them.
And so glaciers are these magnificent beings, and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them, but what I'm particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations.
There's no kind of social protocol for this.
And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice.
Now I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal.
That is the equivalent of what we face now.
Once again, the same process repeats.
Let me translate for you.
So I'm a social psychologist, and I study morality, and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds.
There's only one species on the planet that can do this without kinship, and that, of course, is us.
We love to circle around things.
This is a graph that shows the degree to which voting in Congress falls strictly along the left-right axis, so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is, you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues.
Retiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare.
And what they do on that survey is they ask what's called a feeling thermometer rating.
The moral electromagnet is turning back on, and nowadays, just very recently, Democrats really dislike Republicans.
We will never get back to those low levels of polarization, I believe.
You step out of line, you get punished.
There's no more relationship there.
Sometimes a single threat can polarize us, as we saw.
Other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood.
This means that there's much less money coming into the house.
We are becoming a nation of just two classes.
So if you really care about strengthening families, you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality, who are working on raising the minimum wage, who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives.
No, we start by looking for common threats because common threats make common ground.
The Southern Poverty Law Center is often fighting the prison-industrial complex, fighting to prevent a system that's just sucking in more and more poor young men.
All buildings today have something in common.
And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another, either through the production or the absorption of energy.
Now all this is -- and it's magic -- is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.
Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.
If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today, and have a look at the brickwork, which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days, you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.
It might be able to self-repair, and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment.
This is our protocell technology, effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers, and depositing it in a very complex environment, against natural materials.
So that these don't just exist as one entity, we kind of chemically engineer them.
This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it, which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries.
I might have ended up spending most of my life on the back ward of a hospital, but that isn't how my life turned out.
I was gaunt. I walked as though my legs were wooden.
Time is. Time has come.' 'White is leaving,' Steve said somberly.
He's definitely the star of my show.
I sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain.
But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status, and there are people with the illness who are full-time professionals with major responsibilities.
It's a flat surface. It's safe.' Rebel and Val followed and they asked what had gotten into me.
'We've got to case the joint.
A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before: half groan, half scream, barely human and pure terror.
I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.
They wouldn't experience restraints as we would."
I felt that if I could manage without medication, I could prove that, after all, I wasn't really mentally ill, it was some terrible mistake.
Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan, I went to see Dr. Marder, a schizophrenia expert who was following me for medication side effects.
I could get you admitted right away, and the whole thing could be very discrete.' 'Ha, ha, ha.
Everything about this illness says I shouldn't be here, but I am. And I am, I think, for three reasons: First, I've had excellent treatment.
There are people with schizophrenia, and these people may be your spouse, they may be your child, they may be your neighbor, they may be your friend, they may be your coworker.
Please, continue to let us see characters in your movies, your plays, your columns, who suffer with severe mental illness.
What those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everybody wants: in the words of Sigmund Freud, "to work and to love."
I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.
Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving.
What?
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.
Similar problems are emerging in the east as well.
Nearly every year for more than a hundred years, it's looked like this in the summer.
These senior water rights are key.
And I'm sure you all know, this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities.
I mean, there's water in beer.
It's a broken system.
This individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion, leaving the water in the stream.
It provides a simple, inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems, while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them.
And when we make these connections, we can and we do turn this into this.
They're completely flat, and they're basically cardboard characters.
So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — — around the time when I was, when I started watching those TV shows.
My editorial director and I went through them and put together a staff of people, and we launched last September.
Like, that's all you have to do.
And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI, versus the right prefrontal cortex.
And learning about Matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work.
What if compassion is also profitable?
It's a company that thrives on idealism.
The first example is the largest annual community event -- where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities -- was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official, because it just became too big.
And this idea, again, came from the grassroots, from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job.
There are three components of compassion.
And because they're ambitious for a greater good, they feel no need to inflate their own egos.
I mean, you come to work in the morning, and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in India.
This awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in.
We even created a seven-week curriculum on emotion intelligence, which we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself."
The idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time.
What does that mean? Imagine this.
I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes, not the other guy -- the Dalai Lama, who said, "If you want others to be happy, practice compassion.
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia, but of the 113 developing countries that torture, 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured.
Could we do something for these 93 countries?
And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws.
Or is it other countries?
So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases.
What's going on?"
And as I tell you this, I'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like, "Oh, okay, it sounds like we could do it, but can we really do it?"
So in China, for instance, great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished.
And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery, or end apartheid.
You know, he never quite made it to all of them every day, but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners. And I would lift him, and he would put his fingers through.
Thank you.
Just to give you an example: this is the exhibition, Humble Masterpieces, as it was at MoMA in 2004.
you know when they do homeworks at home?
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more what I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.
I'm always amazed -- three-year-olds know who Richard Serra is and take you to the galleries.
However cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design, and it is miles away from the fancy furniture, but still, it's part of my same field of passion.
And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California; at that time, they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market.
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs, current conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues, and then what they do at the end -- if they are good -- is much more than the sum of its parts.
So, this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle.
But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore; design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point.
This is Cindy van den Bremen, who is a Dutch designer that's done this series of Capsters.
And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury, and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much.
Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint, all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona.
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously, just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years, so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is.
The next show that I'm going to work on -- and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here -- is about the relationship between design and science.
So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions, as you can see.
Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' " And they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans who really need help."
And like many African families, my parents could never save because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents, and things were always dicey.
They talk about corruption.
So we went to the school, and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege, and because my father didn't have the right last name, he was treated like dirt.
My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.
The first time he got sick, he recovered.
At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya, and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday.
This is the damage it causes.
And I was just moved.
We had some of them this morning.
The other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up -- is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.
The cheetah generation.
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C., Covington and Burling, six figures.
And we give them business development services, as well as financing loan and equity.
And basically, we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians.
They come from us.
I've had lots of conversations about things I think need to be happening in Africa.
My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.
And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School, because he took an interest.
So I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school."
You can meet other individuals here.
Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever, that doesn't define who you are.
With Syria to the north, Israel and Palestine to the south, and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented and unstable.
Organizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident may sound strange, but at that time, even during my most vulnerable condition, I needed to dream big.
I personally met with people from all walks of life -- mayors, NGOs, schoolchildren, politicians, militiamen, people from mosques, churches, the president of the country, even housewives.
But for every disaster we had, the marathon found ways to bring people together.
Government protesters became sideline cheerleaders.
The first annual all-women-and-girls race for empowerment, which is one of its kind in the region, has just taken place only a few weeks ago, with 4,512 women, including the first lady, and this is only the beginning.
From Boston to Beirut, we stand as one.
They're two big words, I don't know what they mean.
He's a doctor there.
Now anemia -- I'm an engineer, but even I knew -- that anemia is something which is not supposed to be fatal.
She told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia.
Now let me take you back to Parol.
It had to be simple enough for that woman ASHA worker to use.
So this is a machine called the ToucHB Quik.
We are actually really very excited about what else non-invasive techniques like this will be able to crack in the future.
That's a simple bottom-line business plan.
The questions and conversations that followed were fascinating.
But if instead we have the guts to confuse our students, perplex them, and evoke real questions, through those questions, we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust and informed methods of blended instruction.
Second, he embraced, and didn't fear, the messy process of trial and error, the inevitable process of trial and error.
What we do is important. It deserves our care, but it also deserves our revision.
And, on the left, Riley.
But if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry, we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day, and spark their imagination.
We were about 11,000 people living here.
So let's move to chapter two: the oil era.
Someone says, "How so? How could this happen?"
So what's the population today?
But what is interesting about the story that I've just said?
So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain.
That is our river.
And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by 2050.
We import 90 percent of our food, and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land.
So we know very well -- I showed you earlier -- that we need this energy.
That water will go then to the farmers, and the farmers will be able to water their plants, and they will be able then to supply society with food.
Good afternoon. I am proud to be here at TEDxKrakow.
Saleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria would be either challenged or already on their knees.
It helped local Lech Walesa to kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland and beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it.
So this system: just obsolete. They expired, and young people of the Arab World have awakened one morning and understood that power lies in their hands.
They will say, "People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure."
They appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt.
If you maintain nonviolent discipline, you will exclusively win.
We won't call for the March of Millions.
This is dynamics between fear and apathy on one side and enthusiasm and humor on another side.
Sounds loud. And within the minutes, we were sitting in a nearby cafe having coffee, and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing.
When you start to mock them, it hurts.
This is how he became the public, and this is what probably became the straw which broke the camel's back.
Are they going to find their skills, their enthusiasm, and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform, or will they just stay complaining about the endless list of the things they hate?
I woke up the morning after I gave that Talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life.
I had a slide that said Breakdown.
And she said, "Well, I think it's too late."
That ... me neither."
I had no contingency plan for four million.
The majority of people.
We'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame."
And I'm going to be really honest with you.
And then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"
So when I became Vulnerability TED, like an action figure -- like Ninja Barbie, but I'm Vulnerability TED -- I thought, I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind, because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability.
Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul.
And when people start talking about privilege, they get paralyzed by shame.
So you know what I did? I made it."
You know why this place is amazing?
The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat.
I know you don't think that you're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough.
Guilt is "I did something bad."
Guilt, inversely correlated with those things.
Shame feels the same for men and women, but it's organized by gender.
Weak.
"They'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down.
He asked, what do women need to do to conform to female norms?
And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena, because I think I did it my whole life, and think to myself, I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.
Birds are very agile.
So why do we do all this?
And it is all out of carbon fiber.
With a split wing we get the lift at the upper wing, and we get the propulsion at the lower wing.
Markus Fischer: Yeah, sure.
If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.
He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan.
Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.
Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.
And then so, one had to constantly innovate.
It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients, very efficient process, but we looked at, are we solving the problem?
And how much will they pay for this?
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited, and then they really are the backbone of the organization.
And we were helped by the market inefficiency.
We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India, many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.
And we do about 300,000.
Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you, in conditions where the problem is very large, which cuts across all economic strata, where we have a good solution, I think the process I described, you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care, can give an answer, and there are many which fit this paradigm.
It is ourselves we are helping.
That's my question.
We shift the gravitational center of it.
So let me show you the shape-changing mobile.
So in that case -- like here, there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen -- the shape of the phone could tell you, "Okay, off the screen right here, there is more content.
Let me show you the living mobile phone.
What's behind that is a postulation, namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future; rather than that, technology, a bit more human.
It was as if they couldn't see me anymore, as if an invisibility cloak had descended.
The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with.
I literally have the freedom to move in 360 degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom.
You're all part of the artwork too.
California is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this.
Well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had 1,000 years ago.
Because in town -- this is the bustling squatter city of Kibera, near Nairobi -- they see action. They see opportunity.
Cable TV, water, the whole gamut, all gets stolen.
Now they're showing us how they do their phone service.
The answer is, "Everything."
We don't understand how it works yet, but we have to.
So one thing slammed up against another, such as in Sao Paulo here.
And when they're gone the natural environment starts to come back very rapidly.
Now, for us environmentalists, maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb.
And young people in brand new cities they're inventing, doing new things, in the south.
It brings carrying capacity down, and there's not enough carrying capacity to support the people. And then you're in trouble.
And if we can eventually get good solar in space, that also could help.
That's where you see some of the source, not from my fellow environmentalists, but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power.
Here's the design of an early one from Toshiba.
In terms of proliferation, nuclear energy has done more to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity.
They reduce pesticide use.
There will be events, like 35,000 people dying of a heat wave, which happened a while back.
That would be considered an act of war by both nations.
A nice one, because it can happen lots of little ways in lots of little places, is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians who made good agricultural soil by pyrolizing, smoldering, plant waste, and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon while it's improving the soil.
Now I'm not a scientist, but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil in the Gulf of Mexico.
She pointed out that the "control men" -- as she called them -- who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like DDT, were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects, not the birds.
And BP was hardly our first experience of this in recent years.
Given the stakes, the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle -- the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible, we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty.
It's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science.
You're either an incredibly good scammer, and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system -- or you're some kind of boy genius, the likes of which the world has never seen.
The flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted, chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides.
I'm showing it because -- they're not a sponsor, are they? -- because, in its own way, this is a crass version of our founding story.
Because this is our real master-narrative: however much we mess up, there will always be more -- more water, more land, more untapped resources.
I believe that we know this, yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.
Now, would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show.
So this is where the tar sands live, under one of the last magnificent Boreal forests.
I find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth, the largest ever built.
Just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet, off the power of sun, wind and waves, we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest, highest-emitting stuff imaginable.
So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.
For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.
Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today, but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...
BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.
BF: Oh yeah, it does.
DH: Perfect.
BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference, it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.
BF: OK, sorry.
It's kind of neat. OK.
OK, hold on.
RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard.
Could you just push that?
BF: I'm going to run up behind him.
DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?
Actually, we will take a second to prove -- this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.
DH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right?
We went too far.
DH: All right, we'll try again.
Weird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this.
And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.
What do you want me to do with it?
BF: It's progress, that's the thing.
You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr.
BF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time.
DH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you.
It was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers.
He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge, and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking.
So as I go through this talk, I want you to imagine this gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like.
This monstrosity over here is the CPU, the chip, if you like.
There's this incredible complexity in the CPU, and this incredible regularity in the memory.
You've got punch cards, a CPU and memory.
You also need graphics, right?
The Duke of Wellington is there, you know, get out the machine, obviously demonstrates it, and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really, who said, "I understand what this does, and I understand the future of this machine."
If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.
He laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science, and said, "It doesn't matter how you make a computer."
It did have a RAM pack.
That's been done. The second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build.
Before the 2030s happen, we'll have it.
I'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures I've done in the last year.
Coral reef in New Caledonia.
It lost 80 percent of its ice.
The beautiful picture, by [unclear] in Africa.
According to the U.N., we speak about 250 million refugees in 2050.
I'm going to show you this.
Seventh We invented stories, we flew around the world, while remaining in our attic.
And I will forever feel a need to make reparations to Iraq.
13th After seven years now of being in a wheelchair, I've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair.
If I do like you, I give you one cow and many other things and we become friends.
I'm very proud to show you the teaser.
Fishing, breeding, farming are still the world's foremost human occupations.
Our energy sources are not sustainable.
Y Luc Besson is the producer of the movie.
Let me tell you something.
Women have two copies of that big X chromosome; men have the X and, of course, that small copy of the Y.
And so 15 years, actually, and about four billion dollars later, the genome was sequenced and published.
And that 200 is going to change to 600 this summer, and there's no sign of this pace slowing.
It's called the Beijing Genomics Institute.
She comes back three years later at age 42 with more ovarian cancer, more chemotherapy.
I mean, if they have the same mutation, and they get this genetic test, and they understand it, then they can go and get regular screens, and they can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life.
And what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR, which is responsible for producing serotonin, among other things.
And it's not that he's not eating, it's that when he eats, his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut.
Today, it's here.
And then more general versions of word processors came about.
And I was required to answer: A. I have never had a genetic test, B. I've had one, here you go, and C. I've had one and I'm not telling.
Do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy?
So my father's father was one of 10 Resnick brothers.
You have bigger clan gatherings and so on.
So I am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.
And the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue, and kind of punch it into the hard bone, into the tuchus -- that's a technical term -- and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out, each time, with a syringe.
And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here.
And played around with this a little bit.
So why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells.
And ultimately -- and here's a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors, who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.
These polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors.
The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works.
As far as either can tell, the other one doesn't exist.
And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced.
Any particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced, and remain invisible to us.
All of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties, and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges.
These four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has.
The most familiar charge is electric charge.
The Higgs, over here on the left, has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern.
For example, this weak force particle and its anti-particle can be created in a collision.
But these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story.
But now I'm going to discuss some new and old ideas about things we don't know yet.
When we look at this new unified pattern, we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing.
Then we can spin these in eight dimensions, and see what the whole pattern looks like.
As we spin it, we can see many of the other intricate patterns contained in this one.
And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new.
If the LHC finds particles that fit this E8 pattern, that will be very, very cool.
In this regard, new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies.
Now it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how I managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full-time employment.
It allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyper-intelligent coral.
GL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics -- that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape.
I kind of feel like I need that for my picture.
It doesn't really matter.
And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind through DNA genetic profiling.
Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution, you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.
And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.
They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.
And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago, and realized that outside the park, this forest, which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies, that a question came to my mind.
Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion.
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages, instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian -- but when we began the TACARE program, it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.
So TACARE is a success.
The indigenous people around the world, before they made a major decision, used to sit around and ask themselves, "How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?"
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural, industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world, seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.
And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.
We have compromised their future.
The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well.
And woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves, in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures, between religions and between us and the natural world.
We have this program in prisons as well.
And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.
And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world, we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.
You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.
We could make a very long list, but obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years of hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment, with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.
She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam.
It's hard for me to believe that it's been 50 years since I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham, Alabama, a kid who loved getting A's, a kid who loved math, who loved to read, a kid who would say to the teacher -- when the teacher said, "Here are 10 problems," to the class, this little fat kid would say, "Give us 10 more."
And they said, "Absolutely not."
They had been literally crying and praying and thinking, "Will we let our 12-year-old participate in this march and probably have to go to jail?"
And as a result of that experience, in the middle of the week, while I was there in jail, Dr. King came and said with our parents, "What you children do this day will have an impact on children who have not been born."
And it has been for 50 years an experiment.
But when I looked at the data, what I found was that, quite frankly, students in general, large numbers were not making it.
That's a big deal. It really is.
And the number one reason, we find, quite frankly, is they did not do well in first year science courses.
It takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students -- their grades, the rigor of the course work, their test-taking skills, their attitude, the fire in their belly, the passion for the work, to make it.
And as a result of those high expectations, we began to find students we wanted to work with to see what could we do to help them, not simply to survive in science and engineering, but to become the very best, to excel.
One young woman had great grades, but test scores were not as high.
Secondly, the idea of building community among the students.
And so our students are working in labs regularly.
I'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying, "I've got this young man in class, a young black guy, and he seems like he's just not excited about the work.
And so we redesigned chemistry, we redesigned physics.
And what does all of that mean?
It is the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution.
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years, some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.
So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers, a crane, a chipping machine and a cold-molding machine.
All of my beverages are packaged in plastic, even at the health food market.
In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.
It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle or a glass bottle, if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water, versus purchasing plastic bottled water.
When you meet someone here at TED -- and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year -- you don't shake somebody's hand and then say, "Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you?"
And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him.
But the difference here is that you can use any surface, you can walk to up to any surface, including your hand if nothing else is available and interact with this projected data.
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically-responsible choice.
In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.
Thank you.
And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism, and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him, if convicted, my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that, publicly.
So we met in November 2002, and Aicha will now tell you how that came about.
I suffered a lot as a mother.
I don't know what happened to him.
This is why I'm here in front of you.
And Aicha started, and she said, "I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent, but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families.
Who else can I meet that I don't know, or that I'm so different from?"
Good morning everybody.
But they just don't seem to get through.
The days and weeks that followed, people fleeing to the hills, being forced to drink contaminated water or face death.
Now I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months, and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife.
So nothing is getting through.
And this is from my pond.
And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.
Replace the top.
What's it taste of?
So let's look at the applications.
They can make their own sterile drinking water, and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.
Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.
So with just eight billion dollars, we can hit the millennium goal's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water.
Those who are interested in poetry, the poem is "A Shropshire Lad" written by A.E. Housman.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we live at one of those times.
What's happening today is that the power that was encased, held to accountability, held to the rule of law, within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.
You see, our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their poison, which is about destroying our systems and our ways.
It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.
And that's a big problem, and we'll return to it in just a second.
My guess is, for what it's worth, is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years, 15, but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered; it has radically changed.
But that's a subject of a different discussion.
But a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances.
But that's no longer true.
Oh yes? Why not?
It's a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging.
Lehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses.
Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country, I have to speak to the Minister of Health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security, I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture because food security is a threat to my security, I have to speak to the Minister of Industry because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies -- as we see from cyber warfare -- I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs because who has entered my country, who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country -- as we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings.
Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age, where everything is connected to everything, the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others.
When I was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union in Geneva in the 1970s, we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them.
The poem is called "No Man is an Island."
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula of longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.
How about these hormones or resveratrol?
The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people in America live to be 100.
If you're a mammal, if you're a rat or an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.
Our bodies have 35 trillion cells, trillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.
But life expectancy in this country is only 78.
Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work, chop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.
You ever notice here in America, social equity seems to peak at about age 24?
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found.
What do they do?
And that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.
They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck, and if things go bad, child gets sick, parent dies, you always have somebody who has your back.
And, roughly translated, it means "the reason for which you wake up in the morning."
And I asked her what it felt like to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter.
They celebrate their Sabbath from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday.
It's white, black, Hispanic, Asian.
So, if you go to an Adventist's party you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint.
At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month.
I've been on 19 hardcore expeditions.
Instead, they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.
When they do do intentional physical activity, it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk, the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline, and they all tend to have a garden.
These people know their sense of purpose, and they activate in their life, that's worth about seven years of extra life expectancy.
And the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe.

So conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional printed circuit boards or wires.
So these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials.
So a little over three years ago, Kirsty Boyle and I started a project we called Open Materials.
The biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment.
Her project's goal is to highlight the expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder.
So the interesting thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity, and we are not afraid to fail.
It's one of the things that we don't like to think about, but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true.
It was just going 65 -- to zero?
You're tasked with navigating it down partially-seen roadways, in and amongst other metal giants, at super-human speeds.
But occasionally we miss something.
And with computation and algorithms and predictive models, we will be able to see the future.
That guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour.
If I have a GPS and a camera in my car, I have a pretty precise idea of where I am and how fast I'm going.
We also attach a discrete short-range communication radio, and the robots talk to each other.
And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way.
I think the biggest problem that we face is our own willingness to share our data.
It's going to make the roads a lot safer.
Craig Venter chairs that event.
We set out to do this.
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.
We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did.
I'm a medical illustrator, and I come from a slightly different point of view.
If you look at the math, E=mc squared, if you look at the cosmological constant, where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe -- these are things that are really difficult to understand.
And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.
So these molecular motors -- we had to work with the Harvard scientists and databank models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.
No life, from the smallest life to everybody here, would be possible without these little micro-machines.
And hopefully we'll be able to use this to discover more truth, and more beauty.
His death hit me pretty hard.
And I had time to relax and to grieve.
Or I washed up in public rest rooms.
I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.
And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.
An essay I'd written about my father, the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.
I was a writer.
But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets.
Welcome to Thailand.
Seven children per family -- tremendous growth at 3.3 percent.
No, we decided to do a bit more.
And then we decided, why not get to religion because in the Philippines, the Catholic Church was pretty strong, and Thai people were Buddhist.
You need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place.
Again, education, class entertainment.
And after 35/36 years, it's still going on.
Of course, it must be American cola.
In all this thing, from seven children to 1.5 children, population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5.
So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military."
So I said, "Okay."
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa.
In every country, every program, you need a symbol, and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.
One says, "Weapon of mass protection."
And let the next Olympics save some lives.
So it just showed you, you could do something about it.
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty.
And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand -- "Coffee and Condoms."
And here is a bamboo building -- all of them are bamboo.
And these are our Thai tulips.
And as it turns out, that's a really hard problem, because you have to build a small, portable robot that's not only really affordable, but it has to be something that people actually want to take home and have around their kids.
He's wary, so he'll keep his eyes on me.
And Romo will actually stream video to this device.
And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad, I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device.
Thank you, Scott.
So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today.
So all of these wi-fi–enabled robots actually learn from each other.
Thank you.
In the last 20 years I have published a few books, but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006, when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.
My first question was, naturally, what was I going to wear?
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.
They only make good former spouses.
I looked like a refrigerator.
No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing, no talking to yourselves, no farting.
My husband is offended when I say this -- although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes -- -- so he shouldn't take it personally.
Soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed.
I don't make them up. There's no need for that.
We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?
Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want; the name doesn't matter, as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.
She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.
If a woman is empowered, her children and her family will be better off.
Women are 51 percent of humankind.
In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings at the UC Berkeley library.
Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.
But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time, there is going to be food there waiting for us, having magically come from somewhere.
By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities.
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West.
So how did we get here?
They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur, that were, in fact, effectively, spiritualized, central food distribution centers.
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world, because it was very difficult to transport food over roads, which were rough.
And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside, which was the main market, were also grain markets.
So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest, from Scotland and Wales.
Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold.
And they're coming into the city by rail.
In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars, drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts, came back with a week's worth of shopping, and wondered what on earth to do with it.
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.
And it was a series of semi-independent city-states, if that sounds remotely familiar, a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad, and grew vegetables in their back gardens, and ate communal meals together, and so on.
It can either mean a good place, or no place.
But anyway, this is -- it's food at the center of life, at the center of family life, being celebrated, being enjoyed, people taking time for it.
It's common. It's fresh.
But anyway, these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
We know we are what we eat.
Everyone chooses a number from zero to 100, we're going to compute the average of those numbers, and whoever's closest to two-thirds of the average wins a fixed prize.
They're not being really strategic at all.
So if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level, you will have learned a little bit about this.
There's a spike at 33. Those are people doing one step.
So they're smart, but poor.
That is, it's a circuit that's used to imagine what other people might do.
Now if you were to step back and say, "What can we do with this information?"
That's kind of a mistake together.
So this is like a management-labor negotiation in which the workers don't know how much profits the privately held company has, right, and they want to maybe hold out for more money, but the company might want to create the impression that there's very little to split: "I'm giving you the most that I can."
So they have a chance of -- they bicker and disagree and end up with less money.
So the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time, and the direction of the arrows flows from the region that's active first in time, and the arrowhead goes to the region that's active later.
There's a lot more arrows.
They're still our closest genetic kin.
Then they disappear and they're replaced by squares, and they have to press the squares that correspond to the numbers from low to high to get an apple reward.
We can try. We'll try. Maybe we'll try.
One chimp is called a matcher.
And as you can see, the chimps, each chimp is one triangle, are circled around, hovering around that prediction.
They're actually closer than any species we've observed.
We have some preliminary evidence from bargaining that early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict whether there will be a bad disagreement that costs money, and chimps are better competitors than humans, as judged by game theory.
And it brings you into the presence of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.
Because I feel an urgency about this.
And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.
Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong, concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.
The same applies to educators.
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.
And I am convinced.
Who knew about extension managers?
I missed the '60s. I read about them; I understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them, but I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome, and it's a place that is never far from my mind.
Part of the reason I'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it.
The primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you're not quite sure where you're going, you're certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency.
I mean, it seems to work for a lot of things.
Not that you know how long number 11 actually is, but you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon with number 11 against the Baths of Caracalla, and so on and so forth. If you were interested.
She parks her dirigible, lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside.
She's managed to save the prosciutto, but in the process she loses the tablecloth, which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner.
He gets up, leaps onto his scooter, races through the city past the church of Santa Maria della Pace, down the alleys, through the streets that tourists may be wandering through, disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn.
And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner.
He arrives at the palazzo, arrives at the big front door.
So I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas, and I'll get inside and underneath and I'll show these things growing and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on.
The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome covers the scars; the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down.
And I've really not done anything much more complicated than make foldout pages.
And I thought, maybe I'm on the right track, but it sort of lost its human quality.
Maybe it has to go back and live with family members; that's not always a good thing, but it does sort of bring pigeons together again.
And I forgot to mention this: whenever he lost a pigeon, he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city.
If you see the red line, you are seeing the trail of the pigeon; if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon.
The only rule of perspective that I think matters is if it looks believable, you've succeeded.
We get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu; it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves.
So there's something super interesting about natural systems.
So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?
So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.
If you have errors, you can replace a part.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute.
He was later, it's said, the basis of the Indiana Jones character.
It sort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology.
And obviously there's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world -- things like the eradication of smallpox, the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer, which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus.
The first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information.
And even in the relatively sterile blood, around one to two percent of this information is dark matter -- can't be classified, can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before.
A hundred years from now, people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses.
So I'll try and do that, but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.
And especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions, then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.
To get to a typical place, you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that into intergalactic space.
And yet from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it.
Which means things that look a bit like stars. But they're not stars.
Now that is knowledge. And if that weren't amazing enough, the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time. That is the growth of knowledge.
And then thirdly, less tangible, but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations, is evidence.
Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space, the same size as our home, the solar system. Now that cube is very empty by human standards, but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.
And locally there you could build particle accelerators, and learn elementary particle physics, and chemistry, and so on.
Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things, from astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong, and most importantly to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.
So let me now apply this to a current controversy, not because I want to advocate any particular solution, but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean.
Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance.
So take two stone tablets, and carve on them.
Let's give him a name, too: Nelson.
The president wanted to change this rule.
I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical, which is that, if we can give more choices to people, and more choices to leaders -- who, in many countries, are also people.
If you zoom in here, you can see North Korea, in outline here, which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.
What Haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak.
So as other countries in the world innovated, in the sense both of developing newer technologies, but also developing newer rules, the Chinese were cut off from those advances.
Hong Kong was a small bit of China that, for most of the 20th century, operated under a very different set of rules than the rest of mainland China -- rules that were copied from working market economies of the time, and administered by the British.
So after the four special zones, there were 14 coastal cites that were open in the same sense, and eventually demonstrated successes in these places that people could opt in to, that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.
And they're large enough to get all of the benefits that we can have when millions of us work together under good rules.
We can go do it over and over again.
In a sense, Britain, inadvertently, through its actions in Hong Kong, did more to reduce world poverty than all the aid programs that we've undertaken in the last century.
So let's talk about how this could play out in practice.
Allow a new city to be built up there.
It's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in without coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.
Take this representation of all of the land.
Their kids can get an education.
There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.
The reason we can be so well off, even though there is so many people on earth, is because of the power of ideas.
And this will be my only comment on it.
So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.
We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters, and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours.
Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean.
And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are: Are we just discovering new members of known families, or are we discovering new families?
Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995, and that from mycoplasma genitalium.
So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those "non-essential genes."
It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA, injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden, that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria.
The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses.
It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours, after its chromosomes are literally blown apart.
So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential, not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues.
To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach.
Every major religion participated in this.
It's about time. End sequence. Take one.
Life is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting, yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective, present focus and future focus.
They cannot wait. The others, of course, wait.
Time perspective is the study of how individuals, all of us, divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories.
It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"
Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented.
And moderate on present-hedonism.
They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health.
And the idea is so simple, so obvious, but I think the consequences are really profound.
And when you look at the news through that filter, a lot falls by the wayside.
Well, let's take science.
What about global politics?
My point is this: In the long run, some news stories are more important than others.
In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact, show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione, and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on, showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.
But these haze particles, it was surmised, before we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years, gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge.
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.
And we have taken pictures like this.
But we couldn't make sense of our images, until, six months after we got into orbit, an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.
It was a tremendously emotional event, and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.
You are looking at a shoreline.
And here is the horizon, OK?
Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.
So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand, or during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.
That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.
Right now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.
And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that, may be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.
Yet, most of you have probably never heard about them.
Palestinian We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel.
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony, and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.
The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.
But that's true for adults too.
The organizers say that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film, felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing, that people cared.
If they multiply, their influence will grow in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
But there were no maps, no maps of roads, no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.
Maps matter.
This is the result of computational geometry, gesture recognition, and machine learning.
It's named after Latin for "seahorse," which it resembles.
And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike.
Well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important.
So that's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.
But we also know where we are through movement.
Do people have grid cells?
And he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car.
They could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery, so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.
They have the same access to the same talent, the same agencies, the same consultants, the same media.
And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked, and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it.
Every single person, every single organization on the planet knows what they do, 100 percent.
And why should anyone care?
And that's how most of us communicate.
The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.
But, as I said before, Apple's just a computer company.
In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell.
If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, looking from the top down, what you see is the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle.
You know, sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, "I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn't feel right."
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it's to hire people who believe what you believe.
It's always the same three things, so let's explore that.
The difference was, Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief.
And they tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out, they would have to take five sets of parts, because that's how many times they would crash before they came in for supper.
Something called the law of diffusion of innovation, and if you don't know the law, you definitely know the terminology.
We all have about 10 percent who just "get it."
And, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great; they did it for themselves.
As we said before, a second ago, the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions, right? You should have success then.
And when they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it, and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.
He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America.
It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August.
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead.
So I had a client who came in, about to be evicted because he hasn't paid his rent.
And his first hire was a legal services attorney to represent the patients.
The real issue is that child is living with 12 other people in a two-bedroom apartment.
So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room -- totally lemonade stand style.
So when I got this email from Dr. Geiger, I knew I was supposed to be proud to be part of this history.
Because if we did, they would be so removed from our current reality.
They will be used for our purposes.
And when the doctor begins the visit, she knows height, weight, is there food at home, is the family living in a shelter.
So on the one hand, this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record.
But mostly we all just sit there forever, waiting.
We know that our doctors and nurses and even social workers aren't enough, that the ticking minutes of health care are too constraining.
College sports teams say, "We're going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning and we're going to measure your performance, and your team's performance, and if you don't measure up or you don't show up, we're going to cut you off the team.
And they leave with the conviction, the ability and the efficacy to realize our most basic aspirations for health care.
Now none of these solutions -- the prescription pad, the electronic medical record, the waiting room, the army of college students -- are perfect.
And I have to say, I was like "Whoa.
Thank you.
My thesis for us today is, instead of building walls to create security, we need to build bridges.
What's wrong with this picture?
This is an attack on the global commons.
So this cyber sea, which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness, is very much under threat as well.
Crew of four. Sophisticated communications sweep.
So here we are, 21st century.
This is Afghanistan. These are Afghan soldiers.
When you can read and write in Afghanistan, you will typically put a pen in your pocket.
This one, the Comfort, operates throughout the Caribbean and the coast of South America conducting patient treatments.
Multiply this by 400,000 patient treatments, this private-public collaboration with security forces, and you begin to see the power of creating security in a very different way.
We tie it together, increasingly, by doing things like this.
I'll give you another example, and it's how you move this message.
So ...
You don't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks.
Thank you.
And we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported.
Thank you.
